good highway mileage 24-25 | 5 love the XM stereo with subwoofer handles good even in rainstorm fun to drive sunroof is nice even when open city mileage 13-18 keep your foot out of it for the 18 great acceleration including highway speeds van loves to go fast 70-80 no problem good visibility thru glass and mirrors comfortable in rear seats front seat a little hard steering wheel needs to extend out a little further for tall drivers kids like the TV and game hookups overall package we love it
Sorry to blast a vehicle that is so highly rated but mine has had recurring problems and they appear to be electrical | When I turn the lights on the dash lights go off | the cruise control only works on occasion | have been to Dealer 3 times to correct a bad tire pressure sensor-still not working and light still on | the battery has been replaced twice in a year | All in all this is my first and probably last Honda product because the battery has left me stranded 8 times in one year with a dead battery | My 14 yr old Quest never stranded me once
Don't buy one with PAX tire system | Class action lawsuit against Honda in process | Tires wear out between 20K- 25k | Expensive to replace | Can only be done at authorized location which is usually Honda dealer | No spares | Ours went flat traveling on Sunday and had to stay over until next day when Honda opened | New tire cost 298 because old could not be fixed only 16k miles on it | Hotel cost 100 | Honda said so sad too bad | We are going to get rid of ours even though it is a great van | Don't want to get stranded in middle of nowhere
We leased a 2004 and currently leasing again a 2007 Honda Odyssey | The 2004 Odyssey never gave we any mechanical or electrical troubles | So far the problem with A 2007 honda odyssey | was a shorted electrical fuse which led to replacing the factory-installed battery | And since then everything is perfectly okay | My family and I love this car because it possess enough power comfortable to drive roomy and has an excellent safety features | Generally Honda Odyssey or any other Japanese cars are very reliable
The van itself is really good | However the PAX tires are HORRIBLE | Paid extra to get the touring edition after 29000 miles tires were worn out | Had to wait over a week to get new tires in cost over 200 per tire to replace | Brushed one up against a curb and the part of the brand new tire peeled off | Honda would not replace it | I feel like I was ripped off by the PAX tire and by Honda's lack of willingness to take responsibility for the problem | The pax tires wear out quickly and are difficult to get replaced in a timely manner | This is the only tire available for the touring edition
We purchased this van brand new without knowing that the tire system was different | All four tires unevenly wear out after 20000 miles on it e | g | they wear out on one edge of all four tires but not the other side | I brought it to Firestone and it was said that the alignment was bad which killed the tired | I brought it to Honda's dealer and all they said was that they were not responsible and I had to pay nearly 1500 to replay a new tire | It's sad | We have purchased 4 Honda and surely this van brand new would be the last one | In addition this van brand new is not very fuel economy e | g | 20 miles on freeway and 15 miles in the city bad | Don't purchase it if you don't want to pay more than it's worth
Honda failed to compensate for the added weight of the pax tires and the results are continual steering wheel vibration longer braking distance tire balancing issues road noise and a poor overall driving experience
We took delivery of our 07 Odyssey only to be greeted by a dead battery the next day | A dead battery was found to be defective and the battery was replaced | The van is currently back at the dealership for replacement of the rear brake discs with 300 miles on the vehicle | THe service advisor defined this situation as lot rot | I will presume that these are just issues that need to be worked out with delivery but so far this is the least reliable initial quality for any vegicle I have ever experienced | This is we's first Honda but we have previously purchased new 3 Fords 1 Saturn 1 Chevrolet and 1 Saab and have never had any delivery issues like we have experienced with this vehicle
So far 800 miles and enjoy the car | Very roomy with good added features like AC power outlets magic third row | Car is not sporty since it lacks the low torque power but still can handle the roads when needed | Kids love | car with the nav and can't get them to get out | Drives well considering it's a minivan and road pavement is more pronounced since it has pax run flat tires basically a steel tire inside a tire | The ex model is much quieter | 18in wheels are low profile and looks aggressive | The Sienna looks docile | Since we just purchased the sienna will update review when it snows since we live in northeast | Wanted awd but not an option | Can't believe Honda doesn't have one available like Sienna
We have NEVER been so dissatisfied with this purchase | Traded a 2002 Sienna w 60K that had better gas mileage and was TROUBLE FREE | Tried trading this unit back in to two different Honda dealers now with 8K | BOTH will only offer 4K BELOW TRADE | Must be because of the maintenance history | Engine throttle appears low was reprogrammed still the same | Windows fog on wet days takes forever to defog | Headliner coming apart at windshield | Sunglass holder broke | Stone dead battery at only 5K | Have had SEVERAL electrical issues shorted out headlamp switch and relays | Sometimes doors don't unlock | We wish we still had our old Toyota | What a mistake buying this van
I purchased this vehicle for the many features my Honda model offers such as storage capability number and placement of cup holders GPS Navigation system DVD player and the list goes on | One feature I thought I was going to appreciate was the run flat tires on my honda model | I was wrong thinking that | I have had three flat tires in 18 months with two repairs costing about 125 with the third requiring replacement of the tire | That bill was about a car payment in value | Lucky for me I had purchased the extended road hazard insurance for the tires | It takes the dealer about 4-5 hours to repair the tire purely outrageous
We recently bought an 07' Odyssey EX which was replacing a 2004 Tahoe and we're so happy with our new purchase | Much more useable space easier entry exit better gas mileage safety with all of those airbags | We love being able to walk thru b w the front seats to get to the kids in the back | Great acceleration handling for a minivan car-like driving | A few improvements would be larger cup holders in center console minor | Better base stereo system sounds ok but signal not strong- probably weak antenna | Sometimes when slowing down and transmission is downshifting it feels like you get bumped from behind kind of pushes you forward even with the brakes on | All in all very happy 9 10
Prior Toyota Sienna owner | Sienna was good but like the Honda better due to the handling ease space utilization | A lot of whining about the fuel consumption | We get just about what EPA states | If you want fuel economy buy a Honda Civic or Fit | You cannot expect great fuel economy in a 4500 LB vehicle
Have owned several Honda vehicles | Top of the line always satisfied | There's a resonant vibration problem inherent to the Odyssey vans based on blogs I have checked since the dealer has not been able to resolve the issue | I have bought new tires balanced etc | Check websites for honday Odyssey vibration problem before you buy
Has both 08 Sienna limited and 07 Odyssey EX-L Navi | Like about Odyssey- stereo brakes and handling | Dislikes- rough ride | 2nd row seat is too firm | 3rd row seat is too narrow | Navi-screen is big but has less resolution and color | Plus the rear view camera uses cheaper CMOS sensor | Which makes rear-view camera useless compare to Sienna | Don't like all of the door switch is on the driver side | No door switch on the b- pillar | Biggest gripe- Gas mileage is horrible | Averaging 14 | 3 | Both 08 sienna gets 20 | 7 | Both 08 sienna averaged 21 | 3 through 70k miles
We've had this ody since July 2007 it is our 2nd ody | We have had only minor problems problems with the back bumper after dealer installed trailer wiring and that's it | Only changed the oil and rotated the tires | No shaking pulling hesitation etc | just a good all around vehicle | I average 19 | 2mpg city and hwy | The vehicle's traction control works great up here in Alaska but I do use dedicated studded snow tires | Road noise is much better than the last model 2002 ody but still noticeable actually it's not much quieter than my 2005 ford diesel | Kids love the car too we put an alpine dvd player in it which is easy for them to use | So the vehicle is easy to like
This van turned out to be very noisy and hard riding | On the test drive the car performed well had a good ride and didn't seem noisy | After arriving at home I checked the tires as is my practice and found that the tires wee inflated at 28 psi although the door sticker says 36 is the recommended pressure | Think the dealer did this on purpose | I keep 32 psi in the tires | We took a 2000 mile trip right after the purchase and found the road and tire noise to be very bad and the rough ride made the trip very unpleasant | Gas mileage is 16-18 | My 99 Chrysler TC got better mileage and had a far more comfortable ride | It's a good looking vehicle but not the superior all-round on that I expected
Great look ride performance | Former Dodge minivan owner Interior very nice comfortable seats good sound system | Road feel is solid stable | Bought this one in Colorado and immediately drove it to Louisiana | I look forward to a pleasant ownership experience
My Odyssey drives well The driver seat is good and supports the driver's back Driving a Toyota Sienna for few hours every day caused me back pain the Odyssey is much better | Gas mileage is poor 17 mixed city hwy 40 60 and 18 | 5 hwy | with or without Air 70 mph Driver only | My other vehicle is SUV with 4 | 5L engine much heavier with 340 Hp does 14 city and 19 Hwy | Sales sticker 19 26 | Honda dealer found that the Gas mileage is within spec | Another problem is the paint that peals of the bumpers | Odyssey had a similar 3 | 5L Engine but gas mileage was 20 city hwy
Honda Odyssey rides better than my 05 Dodge Grand Caravan | Engine is smooth fuel economy is great | Small amount of road noise not serious | Overall very satisfied
Looked long and hard and having owned a 2001 ODY for past seven years we got our fifth Honda product a 2007 ODY Touring | We drove Chrysler T Ctop of line 2008 Sienna 2008T O L Hyundai Entourage 2007 Limited Ultimate Pkge | Entourage would have been second choice but it couldn't match Honda's tight turning | The 2007 Honda reliability and fit and finish is still up to high standards | Handling is superb | We2001 ody was a really great reliable inexpensive car to operate | I assume the 2007 will be the same | Wee are justHondaa people | If you are one you'll know what's special about these vans
Like many other owners we too are having transmission issues | We just had to the dealer for the transmission judder fix but guess what | It's worse than it was before | Vehicle shakes at 25 MPH while transmission hunts for a gear especially on hills | There is also an intermittent shake at highway speeds 70 MPH that I no longer believe has anything to do with tires or alignment but with the drivetrain itself | Like others when entering exiting ECO mode there is too much noise from the transmission | The VCM system does not seem to improve gas mileage so I say Honda should eliminate it | We've had 7 Hondas now and this is the first and only Odyssey we will own
Finally went back to Honda van because of good gas mileage for a van rear comft seats that went into well | comfortable other seats leather moonroof great driving ability for van classand great hauling capability for two going-to-be retired coupleplus low platform and again comfort for the aging population | Also excellent design to see outside windows and to park | We had the original vanthen went to a Nissan quest and then to the Villager Estatemercury | We wanted to leave the seats in and have the back like an old fashion 70's station wagon but front comfort of a van | Honda filled the bill again | I have been driving a Honda Accord beginning in the early 90's | Love Honda drive ride interior
This is our second Odyssey | Our cannot believe the difference in refinement and performance over the '99 which we thought was a very good vehicle | Great drivetrain smooth powerful engine drive by wire throttle is very responsive excellent shifts | The audio system is not great but if you want to spend a bit more money upgrade with aftermarket stuff | Very cool NAV system voice activated | XM radio was a nice touch | The interior is very well laid out high quality | Would have been nice to have a 110volt outlet but we'll make do | Also I prefer the cruise control on my '97 M3 why do you need 4-5 buttons to control it when one stalk will do | Great job Honda
Just bought the new Touring model after owning a 2003 Odyssey | Loved the 2003 but this one is amazing | Too many features and all are great | Navigation system is too good to be true more room and I still feel like I'm driving my Accord | Thought about the Sienna for a day or two due to the AWD but made the right choice with nthe Honda
We really like the Odyssey mini-van but the fuel mileage is absolutely horrible | I agree with many other reviews | I knew we were not getting good fuel mileage and finally checked it on a beach trip | We averaged a very poor 17 | 2 mpg | My parents averaged over 18 mpg in their Chevy Tahoe | Other than fuel mileage being much less than advertised we really like the vehicle
My new 2007 Honda Odyssey drives and performs relatively well but there were two key areas where I am simply not satisfied | My biggest disappointment is in Honda odyssey's horrible gas mileage far less that what is quoted by Honda | I only get 15 mpg in city | At over 3 per gallon this is outrageous | I can almost see the fuel gauge dropping as I'm driving down the road | In addition Honda Co | decided to save money at the consumer's expense by no longer including basic items like cargo netting middle row compartment lazy Susan etc | in their 2007 models as they have in previous years | It was a let down to find this out after purchasing the vehicle
My wife and I purchased a new 2007 Honda Odyssey | My wife and i has been in the shop several times | Recently after having service completed for a defective steering pump my wife lost control of her van when the steering wheel locked up | Her van was towed and the service department claimed my wife and i accidentally replaced the defected steering pump with a defected steering pump | All that said be careful buying a Honda Odyssey the so- called Honda Quality is not all that it's worth | Please Be Careful
Car rides smooth | Plenty of power for a minivan | Handles well | Honda navigation is great but voice activation is not very good | Great car | The storage is great and there is plenty of room for everything
Van drives like a truck | Bad front end | New tires did not help | Dealership just makes excuses | Brakes squeak and factory rep and dealership say to read the owners manual and it will say you may have squeaky brakes | The owners will not correct them | Owners manual comes after the purchase | How dumb is that
Pleasantly surprised at handling and comfort of this minivan after trading in my Lexus GX470 for it | Need seating for grandkid visits | 8 passenger option a real plus | Would have bought the Touring model except for the run flat tires
This was my replacement for a domestic van we had owned | I think the American brands will return to the top soon if this Honda van is any indication | Van has 23k mi currently and has a series of Tsb | My service reps all respond to these problems like my service's news to me | However once you inform them of the tech serv bulletin TSB tsb relent | I think Honda needs to get back in the game with superior eng and quality | This is my 5th Honda and possibly my last | I hope Honda steps up to the plate with this warranty
2nd Odyssey replacing one purchased in 2000 | Honda fixed my previous complaints with the '00 including having a 5 speed leather heated seats is much quieter moonroof and a exterior temperature display | The folding rear seat is improved with headrests that don't come off and the whole thing collapses easier | Spare tire relocated to the back cabin making room for extra storage in the second row floor | HWY mileage improved tp 27 MPG with variable cylinder shutoff despite the engine horsepower now at 255 from 210 in '00 | All that said what I like most about the Odyssey is its car like ride | It simply drives wonderful with hardly any body roll | Drive a GM van and you'll understand
New in 2007 1 Telescopic steering wheelgreat if over 6' 2 Tire Pressure Monitor which alerts the driver if one of the tires experiences loss in air pressure 3 Coin Holder in center dash cup holders | The leather seats are very comfortable and the front captain seats offer electric heating for those in colder climates | The instrument panel is very intuitive the design lighting is the best I have viewed | Odyssey is filled with safety features from the front side curtain airbags along with sliding side doors that will stop if they encounter any resistance | VCM feature shuts down one bank of cylinders when coasting thus increasing fuel economy | I highly recommend Odyssey
Be sure you need a van the bulk gets to you after a while | On HWY and or snow its unbeatable | On hills low speed it is not great | If you do town driving and like good MPG then buy something else | MPG will get better after 15000 | Transmission droning sound especially at 1500 RPM which is where it likes to stay is true or 1500 RPM gets rid of the drone | Pay extra for rear parking assist | VCM works well but the 08 model had 34 or 6 cyl operation
I read several of the previous reviews and had to comment | I am surprised at how many Odyssey owners are so disappointed | I guess we are lucky | I think its perfect | The fuel economy is never going to be what the sticker says on any vehicle | We all bought the van because we had to haul multiple people | The more you haul the heavier the van and the lower your fuel economy | Improve your driving habits properly inflate your tires etc | and you'll get better fuel economy | It drives smooth handles well strong engine good looks luxurious and storage is great | I've driven Sienna Grand Caravan Uplander Freestar Sedona SUVs in the last two years | Hands down winner is Odyssey
My wife and I were never Van people | But since retiring and needing more room when visiting our 6 grandchildren we started researching the van market | And after reviewing and driving the top 5 our settled on the 2007 Honda Odyssey Touring loaded | Our travel a good bit and the voice activated nav | really comes in handy | Our haven't found anything negative about about our van as yet | Fun responsive roomy elegant appointments and all electronics are easy to access and learn even for our no-techs | Our couldn't be more satisfied | Thanks Honda for engineering such a great machine
This is a first impression only | but so far the new 07 Honda Odyssey has me very impressed | We just upgraded from a Subaru Forester | The new 07 honda odyssey gives us lots more space seating flexibility comfort safety and creature comforts | I am dreading to find out what the actual mpg will be but that's a sacrifice you make by getting a van | Initial impressions include solid craftsmanship nice interior design solid pick-up great rear camera feature nice drive
This is my second Honda Odyssey that I've purchased as a new vehicle from the dealer | After about 30000 miles a problem developed with a noise sounds like an old clunker | It sounds like a transmission or a valve noise on acceleration especially on the highest gear when the car is under even slight load | Honda is stating per Honda Engineer that this is a normal noise even thought Honda dealer already replaced shields transmission torque converter and other parts but they refuse to actually fix it | Honda dealer have done about 3000 worth of repairs and they refuse to replace a transmission which is probably cause of this noise | I Will Not Buy Honda ever again
Why did we buy a 07 Odyssey Touring RN well the VALUE of HONDA doesn't decrease like it does with any other van available on the market | SAFETY is the number one reason why you should buy an Odyssey We get decent mileage considering that we drive a 4000lbs tank | We have a 06 Odyssey EXL NR with 33K miles and it drives and rides like it just came out of the showroom | So the 06 will have 150K in another 4 years | We could have gotten a ford product since my dad works for them but they would never hold the value | If them ever come out with a VOLVO Van we may consider it but until such time Its the Odyssey | Yeah it might be a tank but it can do so much for so little
Very pleased with the seating and leg comfort | It is important to have good seats and leg room in the second and third rows which Honda offers over the other two competitors | Having driven Lincolns for years comfort was 1 priority and the Honda Touring gives you all and more | Gas mileage has been in the range of 20 22 town hwy and 25 26 hwy on recent 4000 mile trip | Use of cruise control does give better mileage | I am impressed with the mileage as this van is 235lbs heavier than a Lincoln TC
I did not have any transmission problems until I had my Odyssey for about a year | I have had it into the dealer three times and they tell me that there is not a problem | Apparently the dealer hook it up to a computer and it tells them there is not a problem so no problem exists in their mind | My vehicle chronically searches for a gear at low speeds | My vehicle also has a shake to it when trying to maintain a lower speed | The dealer looks at me like I'm crazy but I have 2 other friends with Odysseys and the same complaints | I wish Honda would stand behind honda's product before their reputation is ruined for good | This is SO disappointing | We traded in we's Toyota van for Honda and wish we hadn't
I put on 2000 miles a month | I get about 20 mpg in town and 23-25 on the highway at 60-65 | At 70-75 on the interstate it's about 22 mpg | Nothing to complain about there | The car is more comfortable than the Grand Caravans I've owned or than my son's 08 Sienna | The feel on the road is much better than My son's 08 sienna for me as a driver or passenger | I'll get about 35K on the PAX tires and then I'll dump them and the rims | WheelMax has the replacements and various Honda dealers online have the tire pressure sensors at 35 apiece | The whole switch will cost what new PAX tires would and then anyone can repair replace a blowout
This is our second Honda Odyssey and it is completely new from our 2003 | New features quiet driving all the extras you could possibly want | Can seat 8 8 airbags more cupholders under the floor storage | New dash | Just love driving it
I love the honda mini van because of it's comfort | My mom's car is much more bulky and hard to view things she has an old toyota sienna Lastly I got my odyssey a little while ago and have had no problems at ALL
Never should have traded in our 2004 Odyssey | This car maybe gets 13 miles per gallon no matter how we drive | The automatic doors need to be repaired | There is a radio antenna in the window so the reception is poor at best | A tremendous amount of interior noise | Problem with transmission | Van always bucking when you decelerate | Unable to duplicate they say | All in all a piece of crap | Please do not buy this Van | Honda should be ashamed of themselves
Only had the Odyssey a couple of weeks but I'm very impressed | The Nav | is Awesome | Haven't had a chance to check the gas mileage out yet | One this extra that the nav | does that the book won't tell you is you can pull up Religious Organizations | Under Places go to Advanced and put in Religous Organization | We have a small Church and it was even listed | That's good for A small church goers
Good acceleration steering and suspension for a minivan | Minor creaking and body flex noise when starting from a stop | Also when stopping transmission is clunky and feels like it is pushing you forward | Overall by far the best reliable performance for the money | Was surprised about the clunky transmission for a Honda | Highway mileage so far 24 | 5 at 75-80 mph-not bad for a 5200lb | vehicle loaded with a V-6 | Rear DVD is worth its weight in gold for kids | Radio signal reception is poor | More road noise than I expected
I really enjoy this mini van | I have had Dodge and Chrysler previously- after a while problems with engine and electronics | So I decided I would buy either Honda or Toyota | I really enjoy the easy access front seat to back to attend to baby | I like that both doors slide open and the back door window go down as well | It drives very smooth and it gives a family of 5 plenty of room | It has been great when we travel | I do not feel squeezed in | I feel that I have plenty of room | I would recommend this vehicle | The AC and heat work great | I live in Texas so Ac is a BIG deal | The stereo system that came with the model is very good as well
had been researching and fallowing Odyssey for last 5 yars and heard nothing but good from the owners and mechanics | Finally I got my own and I love everyting about this van | After having cChevy Astro for 6 annoying years there will be no more GM's in my family | I had Odyssey for almost three month already and 2600 miles | No complains yet except for the poor gas mileage but I was told odyssey improves with more miles | If you have kids recomend to get a van with DVD player | I bought van without DVD and my wife and I suffer during the long trips
Great minivan | The RES is A | We have a Dodge Grand Caravan as well and this vehicle is far superior | Test drove a pilot as well | This Van was more flexible for getting people in and out of it than a pilot | The leather interior is very nice and the heated seats are great | The car has a very tight turning radius compared to we's Dodge | The interior controls are laid out nicely | The interior controls are a bonus | Opted not to get the touring model because of the required run-flat tires | Costly to replace Did not have a need for the navi so I opted not to get it | Me and my wife now fight to drive a dodge grand caravan | The stereo system is weak and the speakers are lame
I purchased in July 2009 a used 2007 Honda Odyssey with 30k miles on it | After driving for two weeks realized it has vibrations and skipping from the transmission | Will NOT keep a constant speed and vibrates at 40mph | It had no prior warranty claims and clean carfax | Love the van but I have a transmission on order and haven't even made the first payment | Thank God for warranty | If we continue to have problems we will seek help from the dealer to get us out of it | Honda needs to recognize this problem | I am sick to my stomach but thankful for the Certified warranty | the certified warranty is covered til 100k miles
We just bought the 2007 Honda Odyssey and I love it | I was driving a 2003 Chevy Tahoe which I thought I couldn't live without until I drove Honda odyssey | This van handles wonderfully and is very comfortable not to mention the excellent gas mileage | We traded in our Tahoe because we were so tired of pouring gas into it | At about 70 to fill our tahoe up | we were dying | Honda odyssey costs about 45 to fill our tahoe up | We couldn't beleive our tahoe | The road noise is worse than I had hoped Our tTahoewas very quiet but was also high off the ground | It is very easy to get my 18 month old in out of this van no more climbing up to load him in his car seat | I love it | even though I said I'd never drive a van
Mileage on the sticker is a pure lie and cheating | In growing family the gas expense is burden now | When asked dealer they said 16 for city and highway combined is good | Per dealer can get sticker mileage if driven without A C heater radio navigation DVD and at smooth 55mph | Sure why do they have these feature than | Why are they selling in cold Chicago | If DVD has to be off why put it in | Minor touch of metal or so creates dent due to thin paint coat | No MP3 format player no iPod outlet for such an expensive vehicles | Does not have mileage calculator built into Nav system | Same software used in Acura and others should have throwns into this
This is a disappointment after owning a 2001 | Fit finish are not as good | Cabin noise is only slightly improved | Fuel Economy with the variable displacement has been about 16 mpg around town | Max mpg of 20 on a 200 miles trip
We are new to the mini van world coming from the large suv gas guzzling world | After 3 months of research and 6 months of ownership we are very glad of our purchase of the Honda Odyssey | This is truly the vehicle that honestly is the best way to travel with children from ages 7 to 11 | The RES is a savior on the highway and the Navi is an argument saver between me and the wife | Fuel mileage is a best of 27 | 6 on hwy and 19 | 8 in town | I was hesitant on the PAX tires but a local retailer will sell them for 160 tire | whew Recently went on a Vegas Vacation to see the in-laws and loved the trip because of this van
We have bought only Honda and Toyota since 1976 | This Odyssey makes a loud noise after driving on the highway for a few hours | Maybe power steering | Don't know and the dealer says they would not be able to find it till it is happening which is never when I am in town or when they are open | I am thinking to trade the dealer for a sienna | Never heard of not finding a problem like that | Don't they have computerized systems that find problems | Not happy with service at Springfield Honda so may trade | If I do I will never buy another Springfield honda | Want this dealt with before my warranty is up
7000 miles on it since September 2006 | For travel convenience space interior flexibility and features it's a perfect 10 | It handles well has good power and lots of cool features | So far perfect Honda reliability | The kids can climb in without help and play Nintendo on the DVD player | The worst thing is front seat comfort with not enough thigh support and a seat doesn't go back far enough | Temp guage and odo can't be seen together | Dash contols like rear AC system can be confusing | 28 mpg is a lie | We get 21mpg on highway at 75mph | DVD screen rattles squeaks when down | Nav system boots up slow and repeat disclaimer a nuisance | Rear visibility not great but rear camera helps
This is a excellent riding vehicle with many worthwhile safety features | Although the engine has an ECO mode the overall MPG is only 15 | The lowest mileage has been 12 and the highest is 22 during the three months we have owned this vehicle | We previously owned 'O4 Sienna got about 5-6 mpg more for the same type of driving | Access to the third row seat was easier in we's Toyota Sienna | The PAX run flat tires are nice to have but will cost significantly more to replace that conventional tires | The navigation system is easy and fun to use but frequently comes up withentering unverified area on some of our routes | We liked Our previously owned 'o4 sienna better but this is still an excellent minivan
After owning many vehicles I decided to take the Minivan plunge | Thought I was going with the best after all my research | Odyssey has been in shop four times for transmission problems | Seems to surge at specific times and speeds | Dealer has said this is normal but it is to the point it is so noticeable I can't drive this vehicle | Other than this issue we have not had any other problems | Road noise is an issue but it is a good family car | So much for the Honda Quality
Except for the driver's armrest it's a fairly comfortable car and we really like it but it could be better | I get the feeling Honda tried to save costs at the expense of consumers' comfort and convenience | Honda took out the revolving tray in the floor space and the adjustable armrests which were features in the 2006 Honda EX | The driver's armrest is not very good | For the exterior they should have racks with the roof rails
Traded in our 2004 Odyssey for the 2007 version | Love the improvements in design of rear seats driver seat electric 12 v | outlets and usage of space

The 2007 Odyssey with the variable cylinder engine sacrifices city mpg for hwy mpg | As we use our vehicle predominately for city driving the average mileage of 14 mpg is significantly worse than our 2003 Odyssey average of 19 mpg | If we had known we wouldn't have bought our vehicle | Sorry in CT with 2 1 2 years to go
I've only had my Odyssey for 4 days but already I love it | It's a great drive handles just like a sporty car | Everything is so lush and classy looking
Have had my new Odyssey for a bit now and found it is one of the best vehicles I have EVER driven in | My new odyssey drives like a luxury sedan
Great van so far never have any problems yet | A little road noise compare to 02 odyssey | Sliding doors hard to open also when closed especially from outside | Handling and steering very nice | Poor gas mileage average 16 in town dealer said after 5000 miles will improved | Only like style changing from 02 model
Salesman told me I would do better than the Toyota Sienna I traded in which was a lie | Toyota Sienna got 19 combined city highway and 28 highway | Honda Odyssey gets 16 1 2 combined city highway and 21 highway which is a big disappointment
Can't complain about the build or interior | Very poor gas mileage at 12- 13 MPG city | Been trying to drive like Grandma to see if it improves but even then it barely makes 15 MPG | And yes I'm on my 3rd oil change so it's broken in | It's a minivan so didn't expect 30 MPG but it's no where near what the sticker promised | The transmission is real chunky shifts are not smooth and doesn't handle hills well which doesn't help the MPG | And handling isn't at all car-like more like a truck | In this era of 4-5 gas the Odyssey just doesn't make sense I would have been better off with a Sienna or a Caravan | I am really ticked off that Honda lied about The mpg first and last Honda I buy
We bought our Honda after looking at the top three rated this year Toyota Honda Kia | Toyota didn't have as much bang for the buck as Our honda not as many creature comforts | Toyota honda kia has terrible depreciation so would have to have a big-time Gap Insurance and is cheap looking | The Odyssey has been great | We've taken the odyssey to 3 dogs shows tons of room for crates grooming supplies luggage with room to spare | Comfortable ride and GREAT mileage | It gets much better mileage than my little Malibuand there's hardly any road noise | We've owned the big Dodge custom vans a Ford Aerostar etc | so we're not newcomers to the van market
The only knock I can give this fine vehicle is the road noise | This probably from the tires | No problems except a broken A C radiator which was hit by rock kicked up on the freeway | The dealer fixed at no charge even though it was not a equipment failure | I don't know how much VCO helps mileage but it must since it is active even while cruising at 70 mph
I have gotten 30 000 miles on the no flat tires by driving longer than I should | 1200 to replace | Car hesitates at 60 65 mph | Dealer says this is normal | Air noise is bad in the car | Brakes have been replaced twice | They finally got it right at my expense | The gas mileage is no better than 14 mpg in town driving | I have owned many Hondas and this is the first one that has been a total bad experience
This is our first Honda | Fortunately our leased the vehicle and it will be going back to the dealer | Nice exterior more than enough power better features over the same priced Toyota | Main complaint the window sticker says MPG 18 25 and we get 14 22 under normal driving conditions 12 MPG in summer when air conditioner is running | Our lease vehicles and then buy since we do not trust manufacturers | Honda should be ashamed that they mislead consumers with Mpg ratings | This only confirms our suspicions are true
I would not consider another Honda until they fix the excessive road noise | Too bad because the vehicle is excellent in many ways | On a rough surface noise will prevent normal conversation with rear passengers
Sienna was close but was priced higher for similar features | Quest high price plus shape appears to be done by bubble blowing machine | Caravan looks uglier with each new generation and resale value should equal price of a decent TV in a few years | My Odyssy is pretty good inside and out engine is very quiet ride is smooth and overall structure is very tight | Combine that with a roomy interior easy access to 3rd row and a decent list of standard features | Lastly since it is a Honda you'll know that resale value will fare better than others I should know I traded in my old Caravan | Lastly with end of model year you should be able to get pretty close to invoice price
Traded Our awd pilot because we needed the convenience of a mini van | Tested the Odyssey and Sienna | Althugh our liked the features of the Sienna more the Odyssey drove and handled much better | Biggest dissapointment is with the fuel mileage | With our's AWD Pilot we got about 19 overall | With the same type driving in Odyssey we get 16 | Also some minor interior rattles and creaks which are annoying
I have kept a log on my gas mileage since purchasing my Odyssey in August of 07 and bought the Odyssey for its advertised gas mileage | I owned a Chrysler Town and Country for 10 years and my 10 year old van got better gas mileage than this Odyssey | I'm getting 15 city and no more than 19 | 5 Hwy | My sticker advertises 19 26 | My sticker is very disappointing | Also I have had trouble with the transmission being slow to change gears from Park to Drive | Took | in today and they put a computer update on my 10 year old van to speed the delay but it didn't work | It is also sluggish from 10-40 mph with the so called Economy feature kicking on and off to save gas | Poor engineering for gas mileage and transmission
Two issues with my Odyssey | First it shakes when you are slowing down | The dealer stated it was due to tire pressure | Took it in and it still shakes | Second my van was steaming and hissing one day | I took | into the dealer | The service guy did a 15 sec | look over and informed me that it was probably a hole in the condenser caused by a rock | The service guy said they would have to perform a check that would take an hour and that this would not be covered by my warranty as it was not a factory defect | Guess what yep the check revealed that it was a small hole caused by a rock | How the service guy knew that was beyond me | Cost with the check was over 1200 | I found out that many many people have had the same issue
My wife and I think the Honda Odyssey is the nicest car we have ever owned and plan on buying another one in a year or two | The only complaints we have are the difficulty of strapping oneself in with the seat belts as it seems to be too tight of a fit and we wish the second row seats folded into the floor as they do on the Dodge Caravan and other minivans | Minor complaints on an otherwise excellent car | It's extremely quiet and comfortable to drive on the open highway | We love the rear view mirror and Navigational Aid which we use often | It has good get up and go when you need it | An overall excellent choice if you like minivans
Honda continues to build a great vehicle with so many features plenty of power and comfort necessary for those long trips | The ride is smooth and quiet but yet there's plenty of power in reserve when you need it | All the leather seats are very comfortable and actually fit an adult over 6' tall a major selling point for me | We didn't purchase the touring because the additional features were not needed and the consensus was that there are still issues with the run-flat tires that need to be worked out | I think the parking sensors should be standard instead I will be purchasing them from Bernardi Parts | This van has the same turning radius of my '95 accord
We just bought this 07 Odyssey and have only had it 1 week but so far this vehicle is very well built extremely comfortable and performs and handles very well for a minivan | First tank of gas I averaged 20 mpg with mostly city driving | I'm expecting this to improve as the engine breaks in | I read one review that said those people got 14mpg on a tank and I couldn't believe it how were you driving | In fact most of the negatives I read about this 07 odyssey was on gas mileage but I guess those people never owned SUV's | I traded a Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV which was a great vehicle but we wanted the extra seats and better fuel mileage | So far so good | I'll write another review when I get more miles
I raised my two babies in a Caddy DeVille | At ages 5 and 8 it was time to trade into a minivan | Uggg | After months of research Honda kept coming up on top | My mom has a 2002 with 155k miles and still drives like new | So decision made | It is no where near as comfy as the Caddy | But I cannot compare it to The caddy because well that wouldn't be fair | The van drives tight | It has good acceleration when asked | The interior has so far been kid-proof | The automatic side doors are a must for kids | No worries of them flinging a door open into other cars when parked | I put almost 20k miles per year on it | It is doing well and I hope to run it for many more years and still profit
When the power went out for a week in St | Louis last summer and gas stations were shut down for miles I traded driving our Escalade for a Honda minivan and have never again worried about how I'd access enough gas in an emergency | My 4 kids love it it's comfortable to drive the GPS gets me everywhere nearest shoe store I say and it pops up on my screen | Honda is so reliable comfortable and safe that I'm okay with driving a minivan | The later models are an improvement over the original ones no more transmission problems and the automatic doors don't get stuck anymore we owed a '99 model for 4 years
Purchased minivan as the family was growing | Anyone who rides in the van especially the kids find the van to be comfortable for long rides | Found good value in van due to the number of options available in the EX-L
We purchased our 2007 Odyssey to replace a 2004 Toyota Sienna and I wish I could trade back | Fuel economy is unbelievably bad | We live in the country about 30 miles from anywhere and have yet to exceed 16mpg | I've tried setting the cruise on a relatively flat road and then reset the mileage calculator it still won't get better than 17 | The instant fuel economy often drops to below 10mpg on level roads and seems to get worse when the 'ECO' light is on | The dealer said it's within the stated range so too bad | This performance should be embarrassing to Honda | Our 2007 odyssey is only marginally 1-2 mpg better than my full-size full-time 4x4 Expedition with a 5 | 4 liter V-8
We went to the dealership to look at a used Pilot | The Odyssey was sitting next to it so it was easy to compare them side by side | The odyssey must be 50 bigger inside with 3 rows of very roomy comfortable seating for full- size humans and the 07 van was only a couple grand more than the 04 Pilot | Adults wouldn't last long in the Pilot's 3rd row | The odyssey sold itself on the test drive | There's lots of storage cubbies and cup holders galore | We had to give up 4WD but you can't have everything | We're averaging 18 mpg about what I hoped for | The certified used car warranty beats new car coverage | My wife loves driving The odyssey so it looks like we made the right decision
We just moved up from a 2000 Odyssey | The difference is absolutely astounding | The 2007 is quieter has more power and is significantly upgraded on the interior | We've only had the 07 for a few weeks so gas mileage etc | has not been really checked yet | My only complaint is with the IPOD Music Link system which is just awful | We were told the Music Link would work through the radio and Nav system this turned out to be a false statement | The only good news is we's dealer has agreed to pull the Music Link system out and give us a full refund
My husband talked me into buying a minivan because it would be more economical | Out of all of the minivans we test drove the Honda Odyssey was the best with the Toyota Sienna in a close second | However if you are wanting an economical car with good gas mileage do not buy this van | There is many cool features such as the rear view camera Rear Entertainment Center the fact that you can open and close the doors and hatch | But overall I do not think it is worth the money | Therefore we took it back and are getting the GMC Acadia | Seriously check The gmc acadia out I think it is the best crossover on the market
I've owned Hondas in the past and found them reliable so I blindly chose the Odyssey when it was time for a minivan | Big mistake | This huge mini van drove like a bus was difficult to park and had problems the dealer was not able to fix | At 20K miles the rotors warped the front tires had to be replaced and the front wheels were constantly out of balance | At 25K miles the engine mounts failed followed by the torque converter and the A C | It vibrated all the time while driving and the dealer could do no more | Reading the reviews on this model year I found I'm not the only one with these problems | I just traded it in on a Sienna and have never been happier
We recently purchased a 2007 Odyssey to replace our 2002 Odyssey which was totalled in an accident | We have not been as happy with the 2007 as we were with the 2002 | The 2007 is bulkier to drive harder to park shifts rough between 20-30 km h and uses way more gas | 14-17 mpg in city driving is what we are getting and we were told it would be better than that | We are truly disappointed with the gas mileage of the 07 | How can a vehicle be fun to drive when you can literally see the gas gauge moving towards empty as you are driving
My Odyssey is built very well no problems through 25000 miles | My complaint about the car though is the fuel mileage it's as bad as a huge SUV | Car gets 14 mpg city 22 mpg highway | Dealer first told me to wait for it to break in now he states it's normal wow | I am shocked and disappointed with the mileage | Beware if you buy this vehicle you'll spend big bucks for fuel
My wife and I drove several different vans and had it narrowed down to the Sienna XLE and the Odyssey EX-L | I decided that I wanted to drive the Odyssey Touring to see if there was much of a difference | I couldn't believe how much nicer of a drive the Touring model was | I love the touring model | There are a ton of features that are all useful | This is one nice van
Well despite reading about the MPG problems the family bought an 07 Odyssey | We have owned 5 Hondas and have always been very happy with the family | In fact right now we have an 03 Accord and love it | With that said the Odyssey is a comfortable vehicle | Unfortunately the mileage is absolutely terrible | Over the course of 3k miles we have averaged 14 MPG | The Ford Explorer we replaced ave 16 MPG | We just can't seem to do better than 14 MPG regardless of how we drive | You can literally see the fuel guage going down | It stays on F for about 25 miles | All I can say with the price of gas going up make sure you explore your other options and know that the MPG warnings are true
My 2007 Honda Odyssey with 8000 miles started taking my sleep away | Within a month of buying this van transmission of sound from DVD system to wireless earphones failed for which internal wiring had to be replaced and rewired | Within a week from this incident DVD system started malfunctioning and it was replaced | Soon after this the CD radio was replaced to cure a fault | Next was a passenger seat in the middle row which was jamming | the cd radio was replaced too | Front wipers were waiting to break next | My van is with the dealer now to fix them | I wonder if anything in my van will remain as a factory installed equipment at the end of three-year 36000 miles warranty
If I had known prior to purchase this vehicle runs rich I would never have purchased | I cannot not afford 13 mpg in the city | And until I hit the magic of 6500 miles on the van that is the best I can expect | It does about 21 on the interstate | I gave up some nice features in my Pontiac Montana for the privilege of paying more in payments insurance and gas | not a good thing
We priced and looked at all minivans | Owned a Dodge which was fare | Could have bought others for less | But we are extremely happy with our decision | Everything about we's Honda is great | Could never go back to something else even with the more money we spent
Pros It's a Honda well built well designed | Mileage is a blend of city and highway and averages 19 | 2 over life of vehicle | Tons of cargo space | Decent versatility with seating cargo arrangements | Cons One delivery defect deep scratch on dashboard | Unlocking rear side doors is very confusing | Exterior green paint looks like they forgot to add enough green pigment | Option packages too pricey
I researched every domestic minivan on the market | By far the Honda was built the best | It has the smoothest ride plus it doesn't feel like I am driving a bus | The Toyota felt cheap and don't get me started on the Chevy | The honda must have gone to great lengths perfecting their van | It's a Ten
This will be my last Honda or Japanese product | The build quality is terrible on this thing | The build quality rattles and squeaks with only 4000 miles on it | I had to have the whole Nav system replaced | Every bump in the road makes the cd player skip | My other car is a honda too 2004 Accord | My other car has already had the transmission replaced on it as well as not wanting to run in the wet or cold weather | Japanese quality | Never heard of japanese quality
Purchased this vehicle to replace horrible Dodge Caravan | Very happy with Honda except for the use of very cheep interior plastics and poor fuel economy | 12-15 city 17-20 hwy | The plastic around the glove box cup holders and floor boards have many scratches and look worn
