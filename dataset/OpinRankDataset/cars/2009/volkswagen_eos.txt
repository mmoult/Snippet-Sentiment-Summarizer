 "words": After almost 3 months of owning a new EOS I am still happy with the functionality of the sunroof it has good torque throughout the RPM range even compared with other turbo engines it has very good speakers but lousy sound unit premium but the worst for me is how it drives | You have to be really delicate to avoid the car spinning like crazy when you start | I have the upgraded 17'' wheels with Continental tires and that has helped little | So at the end it dissapoints because the engine is great and the DSG gearbox is amazingly smooth but the car is not sitting on the road as it should and can become dangerous because of the big torque it has for its size |
