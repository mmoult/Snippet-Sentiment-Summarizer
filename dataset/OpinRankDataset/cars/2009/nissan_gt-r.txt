REVIEWS
 "words": If anyone out there is considering a purchase of a Nissan GTR do yourself a favor and buy it now | No other car has the performance suspension technology and safety out there for the money | I'm not into being followed by others wanting to take pics of the car but this car really has rock star status | I cant ever go to the gas station without someone coming up and wanting to gaze or gawk at the car | I've had it now for about six months I have no gripes | This thing is just an absolute awesome experience to drive it performs on the track both 1 4 mile and autocross beautifully | Simply put the best car I've ever owned and I did test drive the M3 M5 AMG SL63 and Z06 before buying | 
 "words": If anyone out there is considering a purchase of a Nissan GTR do yourself a favor and buy it now | No other car has the performance suspension technology and safety out there for the money | I'm not into being followed by others wanting to take pics of the car but this car really has rock star status | I cant ever go to the gas station without someone coming up and wanting to gaze or gawk at the car | I've had it now for about six months I have no gripes | This thing is just an absolute awesome experience to drive it performs on the track both 1 4 mile and autocross beautifully | Simply put the best car I've ever owned and I did test drive the M3 M5 AMG SL63 and Z06 before buying | 
 "words": It's the complete package | Performance handling and comfort | No car I have driven is a better combination | Interior is high quality and seats are comfortable | Comfort mode does help the harsh ride though I like the solid stance in R-mode around corners | Shifts when you want it to unlike many auto manuals | Always ready to follow your instruction | An excellent long-distance cruiser or boulevard blaster | 
 "words": this car is everything that I wanted in a car | There are a few things that can be improve like fuel economy | I am getting about 15 miles per gallon and that is driving at normal speed going fast maybe about 11 miles per gallon | When starting the car in the manual mode the car transmission sometimes stalls for a fraction of a second because the transmission is calculating the gears | 
 "words": Too heavy too hyped and too limited | Nicely conceived poorly executed | Drop 600-700 lbs lower two inches get rid of the fancy tranny and eliminate the warranty voided if you use the launch control and this car could be a world class sports car | The AWD needs some work to improve driver feedback | I sold my GT-R in favor of a Corvette Z06 | Nissan developed some great ideas but missed the mark | 
 "words": Nothing compares to this vehicle | You cannot beat it for the dollars almost nothing can beat it's performance the fit and finish work very well at this price point and it does not need to make a lot of noise to get the job done or attract attention | Looks certainly do attract attention it is different not for that purpose but to again get the job done | It's the aero efficiency the 22 ability and real trunk space | The numbers are widely known why would an informed intelligent and cost conscious consumer buy anything else | 
 "words": I only have 117 miles on the car so far but what I can say is that it is really an experience | I purchase the car for a daily driver in Wisconsin | The ride is not that harsh the gear box is a MANUAL for all intense purposes and the shifts feel like a good manual transmission would feel | There is a little too much road noise for my personal taste | 
 "words": The GT-R is without doubt an amazing feat of engineering | That said I'm not sure I love it | I've had an S2000 for four years and like a previous reviewer I really think it is more fun to drive | Whereas the S2000 is a fun little partner in petty 'crime' the GT-R is more akin to a nuclear weapon | I know it's unbelievably powerful and fast but I also get very little chance to use it on the street in a way that seems 'fun | ' But that's a knock against any supercar | So while I greatly respect the GT-R I don't really lust after it in part because it does not look good | 
 "words": I researched this car for over a year against BMW M3 Mercedes C63 AMG Audi RS4 Corvette Z06 and I was coming from a WRX STi and I kid you not this car does it all | I had heard that it had a hard ride and was noisy but it is not the case | It handles beautifully and turns immediately when you want it to | The power is indescribable and the sound of the car in my opinion is just right V8s are overrated | The interior is quality crafted and it has all the modern tech you could need or want | Do not buy if you need usable rear seats | It does better MPG than my STi did and the sound system is great | You had also better get used to the attention you will receive because they are so rare | The BEST
 "words": After ordering my car in January it finally arrived in late October | It was everything I expected and then some | The build quality is excellent and the comfort and interior design are actually quite good for a supercar built at this price | Bang for the buck can not be matched | The only thing I would change would be to tune the exhaust | It is nice at low RPM but almost disappears at speed | I don't want anything obnoxious just some suggestion as to what the car can do | Oh well I guess that fits in with the stealthiness of the car in general | 
 "words": Test drove every single car in 70-80k price range and this was the best | Great for long trips as well as everyday use | 
 "words": The earlier reviews cover most of the salient points so I will comment with a perspective as a mechanic and former SCCA racer and to correct a couple of errors in the other reviews | First not only is there an outside temperature gauge but one can set an auto or manual temp at which the dash display will warn you of icy conditions | My main gripe is that doing one's own service is a challenge on this car | The underside makes it hard to get at the mechanicals and the owner's manual is useless for the DIY'er it reads like a BMW manual | Parts will be very expensive as every fluid is special and costly | But the car gets better the more miles I put on it and it IS a super car for sure | 
 "words": Technology is amazing on this car almost over the top but when you add it all up this car flat out delivers | Engine is phenomenal with gobs of power and a flat torque curve | The two small IHI turbos spool up very quickly so the car feels more like a V-8 than a juiced six | The DCT shifts smoothly in norm and comfort modes and bangs swift and hard in race mode | Note I downrated the fun to drive category because this car is deadly serious and one has to be very attentive to the power and the braking both of which are amazing | My S2000 was more fun to drive but I do not regret buying the GT-R one bit | It gets a lot of attention everywhere I go and I like stealth but I am happy | 
 "words": Just received my GTR | It's always a risk to purchase based on hype rumours and reviews but not being able to test-drive | However this car exceeded my expectations and is incredibly fun to drive | Of course the power is there and I expected it | What I didn't expect is the awesome double clutched auto-manual transmission | It shifts so quickly and precisely | Only problems so far are passenger door not aligned to close properly and some kind of problem with the bluetooth calling numbers without my knowledge kind of embarrassing | Overall a historic and great car | Engineering marvel | 
 "words": Had the car for 5 months now with 11000 km | Transmission started to make severe mechanical noise couldn't shift from 1st to 2nd | The dealer transplanted a new transmission | I still love the car enjoy the acceleration and cornering | If not for the transmission it's a reliable car on every aspect | When you can beat Porsche Turbo at about 1 3 the price I couldn't complain |
