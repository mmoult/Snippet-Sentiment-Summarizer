REVIEWS
 "words": I've had the car 5 months put over 5000 miles on it and have found two faults | Sunlight falls on the navigation audio screen with near blinding effect and substantial road noise occurs at interstate speeds | That's it | I enjoy driving the car so much that I usually regret reaching my destination | Initially the ride was hard but the cause was simply over inflated tires | Unexpectedly at 5K miles I have had a significant uptick in mileage and now get well over EPA average | I am so sold on Hyundai now that I expect to move up to the very quiet Genesis with my next purchase | 
 "words": I was actually looking at the new Genesis but financially the Azera was a better fit for me | I think it is a mistake for Hyundai to discontinue this car because it fits right between the Sonata and Genesis on price point but oh well | Very happy with my choice and Hyundai of New Bern is the best | I love this car | 
 "words": This is one great car except for the city MPG which I am getting only 13-14 mpg | On a trip to the Hyundai factory in Montgomery AL | I averaged 27MPG which is respectable | That plant is really something to see and worth the 650 mile trip each way | My poor gas mileage is on file with my dealer Maybe I have a lemon which I am following up on | 
 "words": It is possible to find faults with this car | At interstate speeds road and wind noise are substantial | Sun light falls on the audio navi screen making it almost unreadable | Otherwise the car is a pure delight to drive | I normally regret reaching my destination | The car is attractive comfortable powerful and has many amenities | Cabin and trunk are spacious also | Just what I wanted excepting the two features mentioned above | 
 "words": This is an amazing great car with unmatched value | My wife and I absolutely love it | Our friends are very impressed | We've owned it for 4 months and I waited until now to do the review | At 3500 miles with majority 80 highway driving the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg | As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design and care into the build of this car | So far this has been the most issue-free car I've owned including Camrys and Accords | There are people who would rave about this car if it was a luxury brand but are more reserved as a Hyundai product | The Azera should be continued to convert these skeptics | 
 "words": We bought this fine vehicle on August 4th2008 and been very satisfied with it in all respects except one a bumpy shift from lower gears to drive | While I find this to be irritating it still does not diminish my enjoying my Azera | 
 "words": I purchase the Hyundai Azera Limited after having a Camry for only 15 months which also was purchsed new The Azera Ltd | has much more power with just scacrificeing a mile or two MPG | The ride is top knotch and the sound system is awesome | Braking is aggressive | The manual shift mode is fun on the twisty roads | Fold-in mirrors is a great auto car wash feature | I found out that the Sun Screen in the back window is not only good on sunny days but also a benefit when the guy behind you has his brights on | So far this car has been a pleasure to drive and own | 
 "words": Having come from a heavy Lincoln Town Car with a 205HP engine I can say that I would be happy with the 233HP engine | With the 263HP engine it's a rocket | The drive-ability is amazing | It's very sure footed even in the rain | It's not unusual for me to drive over 500 miles in a day | This car is comfortable on those long hauls | With slightly more than 20K miles on the car nothing nothing has gone wrong | 
 "words": What a beauty | One option package includes everything | The fit and finish is excellent | Whomever rides in it has nothing but raves | I have had this car for only 21 2 weeks and have not found a thing wrong with it | The price with all thw whistles and bells is so far below the competitions price | The public does not know what they are missing | It was the top of the Hyundai line but probably will be replaced by the Genesis which goes for about 40000 | Too bad | I'll write follow- up in 6 months and see if I still love it | 
 "words": While the fit finish are nice I find the front driver's seat to be extremely uncomfortable and I'm only 5'9 | The auto headlights are sensitive enough | the auto windshields wipers behave erratically | the heating- A C defaults to A C compressor on and most of the settings on the trip computer reset every time you start the car | On top of that the Check Engine Light came on after only 24 hours with the car | had it only 3 weeks but considering a trade in | On the whole disappointed by the little things | 
 "words": This car is amazing | I have a 1999 tiburon which I love | That was the best car I have ever had so I knew I wanted another Hyundai | I was looking at the sonata then I spotted Azzy | There was no going back | The price for all the features was terrific | I did look at the Genesis just for fun but to tell the Truth I still preferred the azera | I have had no problem with the suspension | Best of all-this is a car that fits me | The controls for the seats with a memory is amazing and the pedals move too | I don't have to try to get my seat perfect time and time again after he drives it | He insists he loves his ugly Chevy truck but he jumps in my car every chance he gets | 
 "words": This will be my 3rd Hyundai | My Son drives my old 2003 Sonata with 160K on it | I traded my 07 Santa Fe AWD for this car as I commute to work almost 100 miles a day and need better MPG's | I didn't need or want the Limited as the GLS have all the options I preferred | I have owned it only a couple days and the mileage is 25 mpg but that is a lot of highway | I expect even better once the car is broke in | If you are looking for an Azera the deals are out there | I got about 5K off the MSRP | 
 "words": From the initial test drive the car didn't inspire a lot of oh-wow | comments but it was an interesting design | Seats leave a little bit to be desired in terms of thigh support and the leather stitching on the black gray leather is ugly | But I basically love this car | Bluetooth works great | Trunk size is very good | I have some problems with the transmission at slow speeds as I drive the Washington DC beltway each day | But overall I would definitely buy this car again | Without doubt this is one of the greatest values available | 
 "words": This past year's 15000 mile driving experience has been extremely enjoyable in our new azera ltd ultimate | It gives great performance on regular gas | It included a 4700 mile trip of the maritimes 24 | 6 mpg a 2667 mile trip to Baton Rouge la | 23 | 8 mpg and a 1961 mile to branson mo | 22 mpg | On regular gas the 5 speed automatic transmission plus the dohc 3 | 8 liter al block v6 was much lighter on the front end and performed better than the supercharged 3 | 8 cast iron block premium gas 1997 olds lss 4 speed automatic car it replaced | In over all fact the much more completely featured azera was purchased in current dollars for less than my cost for the new 1997 olds | Great buy for the money | 
 "words": Have owned a 2009 GLS with the Premium Package for 2 months 1600mi | Didn | t need the extra bells and the larger engine so saved a few | Comfortable ride and generously sized for 2 teens in the back seat | Does not feel big and is easy to park and maneuver in traffic | Plenty of power on hills we live at 6800 ft in Colorado and go up and down in elevation constantly plus an average 21-22mpg on about 50 50 city hwy driving | yes I do drive it nicely There is plenty of power available if you choose to use it | I was quite surprised when I | jumped on it | the first time-got up to speed in no time | We did look at Honda Toyota and Nissan and are happy with our decision | 
 "words": I wanted the Azera ever since they came out and finally purchased the loaded Limited with navigation | The car is fantastic | fun to drive | great firm suspension with a sports car feel | interior is top notch | The many features you get with the Limited would cost a fortune if purchased with a BMW or Lexus | I'm looking forward to t nice road trip to the Florida Keys in April and expect to get 27 or so MPG | The 3 | 8 ltr engine is real quick and powerful | Passing on the interstate is easy | You have to remember to check the speedometer because 80 and 90 mph comes up before you realize it | You can't go wrong with the Azera | 
 "words": The driving is fun | Powerfull car nice well finish lots of details making this car amazing | The suspension is not so great is very stiff so if you don't like the feel of the road Do not purchase this car I can't wait to trade in for some other and remember I purchase this car not even 3 months ago | 
 "words": My '09 Azera Limited offers alot of bang for the buck | I have owned 6 Hyundais previously including a '99 Elantra '03 Sonata '04 XG350L '05 XG350L '08 Sonata GLS and an '08 Sonata SE V-6 | The Azera is second best only to the Genesis | I love the features that the Limited offers including the 12 speaker Infinity sound system smooth 3 | 8L V-6 roomy interior smooth ride and great handling in the snow and on the ice | This vehicle has LESS wind and road noise than an Infiniti M45x | 
 "words": After two weeks of reading automobile reviews and visiting showrooms I came to the conclusion that the vehicle that had the most to offer for a very reasonable price was the Hyundai Azera | This sedan has everything that I was looking for style both inside and out performance and price | We bought our Azera Limited in early August and already have driven it over 4000 comfortable and enjoyable miles | It is in my opinion one of the best values available to anyone in the market to buy a new car today | 
 "words": I did the research online and with Consumer Reports | Came down the Azera or the Toyota Avalon | Drove the Avalon nice ride but handling was way to mushy | The Azera was much tighter lots of power | Car has every option except bluetooth | Incredible trunk space | Drove it from Colorado to my folks in Nebraska with my Wife Daughter SIL and Grandson | Babying it on the interstate I got 31mpg coming home with that load and 100lbs of apples at 75mph constant I got 27mpg | I would have like more mpg but the available power is incredible | Haven't driven anything this much fun since my 71 Firebird | The heating AC is great dash and instrument layout is great | 10Y 100K warranty closed the deal | 
 "words": I researched and drove all of the competitors in the full size market | None compared favorably with the features and creature comforts that the Azera offered | It was as much or more comfortable | The interior touches and controls are logical and well designed | The reported issues with the suspension and noise are non-existent in my 2009 LTD | It is exceptionally quiet and the sound system is awesome | The rear sun- shade and memory driver seat make it a joy to drive | 
 "words": After hearing so many of friends rave about their Hyundais I finally decided to investigate when I needed to replace my 2000 Volvo V40 | Well I was equally impressed with both the reviews and the car | I wasn't planning on buying right away but the value of price luxury that the Azera offered was too tempting I have not been disappointed at all after having the Azera for just a week | I have put on over 600 miles on it already | Plush seating fantastic sound system more than ample interior space plenty of power when needed along with stylish looks | This is by far the nicest most decked out vehicle I've ever owned it didn't break my bank either | It blows my old V40 away in every way | 
 "words": Just a quick update since my post of 06-01-2008 | I am still happy with my decision | I have since had the chance to take the car on a thousand mile trip | The car rode very well and my MPG was 26 about 80 to 85 miles per hour | So thus far the car has worked as advertised I am very pleased | 
 "words": Just got the 2009 Azera Limited two days ago thus far I am pleased with my decision | Being an old mechanic I had a hard time making the decision to buy a Hyundai | I always told my customers to buy Toyota Honda or Nissan but after doing some research and driving the car I will add Hyundai to my list of cars I recommend | I was considering the Toyota Avalon Limited but for about 6000 | 00 less I got a comparably equipped Hyundai | The only difference I noticed was the Avalon had a quieter ride but not enough so to justify the price difference | 
 "words": Have you ever been outside on a hot July summer night | The street is warm and the wind is at a stand-still | Then all of the sudden a car whisp by and you don't even see it | That is what happpens when the new Hyundai azera comes through | People don't know what happened | The design is one of a kind | It has a 3 | 8 liter or 3 | 3 liter | Enough hp's to throw your head back | The leather is smooth | Really if it had a Honda or Toyota tag the dealership could not get enough models in stock | So I recommend this car | You shoul go drive drive |
