REVIEWS
 "words": This is my 8th Ford truck and 4th F-150 | Although it is the lower-end STX I find it more comfortable than my previous 2005 Lariat | The seats are more comfortable although I have to agree that the headrests need to be less intrusive | The transmission is better matched to the engine's needs and thus the 3V 4 | 6L feels more powerful than my previous 5 | 4L | I didn't think I would ever drive a truck more comfortable on the highway than my Lariat I was wrong | Smooth is the only way I can describe this truck | A nice feature of my particular truck is that it has the carpet delete option so I don't have to worry about mud and snow messing up the carpet | I just wash it out | 
 "words": I never expected such an all around excellent performer | This truck is very comfortable quiet and very capable in every way | One reason I picked it over the Toyota Tundra is the large gas tank 36 gallons vs 26 gallons | The extra capacity is very helpful when I'm towing | Other great towing features are the integrated brake controller and sway control | 
 "words": I looked for 1-2 year old ones to replace my 2000 and was not finding what I wanted for the money | I am very happy I decided to go with new | I have been getting between 18-19 with the 373 limited slip rear end | Most of used trucks I looked at were beat up or they wanted almost new price | I got mine for invoice | Been very happy with truck so far | The transmission and fit and finish I feel are quite nice for the price and it is a quiet solid truck | 
 "words": My F150 has 16500 miles now | I can't say enough good words for it | I just want to say everyone must have this truck | This truck has a 18-19 combined MPG so far | It can do everything what a sedan or SUV does | It seats 6 people | more room | more comfortable | It can do many things a sedan SUV mini-van can't do | You understand what I meant | I go hunting fishing | I help people move their heavy large stuff | I buy stuff for my house and garden | etc | Everyone must buy a F150 | Only F150 | 
 "words": Great ride very comfortable and quiet | Got the 5 | 4 engine as I got a great deal on an advertised package and the mileage only 1 mpg less | Getting about 14 mpg in the city about the same as my old 97 f150 4 | 7 v- 8 | I noticed in consumer reports they mentioned the truck engine to be a little loud and the ride a little rough | Wow I would have to disagree | This engine and tranny is silky smooth and quiet everyone comments on that who has been in the truck | I test drove some other trucks but this one really feels luxurious | 
 "words": I laughed when I read that another guy's wife sounded off about buying American | My wife did too as I was considering the Tundra or Tacoma but never got to the dealer | I did test drive Dodge GMC and Ford | In every category from deal to doors I like the Ford at least a little better | GMC was a strong consideration and felt more refined but I wasn't looking for refined | I was looking for some big bad truck and I found it in my black XLT 4X4 | 
 "words": Replaced my 07GMC with new Platinum F150 4X4 | A C blows hot for 1st 15 miles | Dealership says is normal because it eventually cools off under 20 miles They drove it for 100 miles and didn't do anythingexcept refill fuel tank Vents blow 20 deg hotter than my other cars | Paid 54 for service at an A C shop in Conroe and it was only low on freon | You'd think Ford would be willing to warranty 54 to keep a customer | Calls to Ford support were replied with sorry the dealer says it is normal | So here it is | Nice truck and you'll like it unless you need A C or unless you need to use the warranty | GM please stay in business | Anyone want a new Platinum 150 | LOL
 "words": I've always owned GM vehicles but the new F150 Platinum outshines anything else on the market | It runs great gets better gas mileage than my old GMC and I get nothing but compliments on it | When I get out of it random people always ask if they can have a look inside | The Platinum is the nicest truck I've ever seen or owned and yet still very functional | The power running boards are the feature that gets the most wow factor | I would not hesitate buying this truck again | The exterior looks great and the interior is as comfortable as any luxury sedan out there | I love my Ford F-150 Platinum | 
 "words": It took me 1 year researching the Internet and 50 test drives of every truck out on the market to make my decision but I chose the 2009 Ford F150 FX4 for my family | Interior was by far the best and back seats were very roomy | This is the truck to buy Here are my takes on the rest of the trucks Dodge Ram Hemi 4X4 Crew- Interior still looks cheap and Hemi makes a whole lot of sound and no go | Toyota Tundra 5 | 7 4X4 Crew- Very fast truck but interior was off key and frame not as strong as the domestic three | Nissan Titan 4X4 Crew- Decent truck but mpg was the lowest and the ride was jittery | Chevy GMC Trucks 4X4 Crew- Back seats where for children only and interior was cheap | 
 "words": I was skeptical about the 09s because Im not a big fan of the front ends so I test drove the Dodge Ram 1500 for the weekend | Loved the look of the truck but the back drivers window squeeked going up and down | The drivers door grinded opening and closing and the volume button came off all in a matter of 3 days | I cant imagine what else would go wrong with it in time | The Chevrolet looked good but the truck is nowhere near as big in the inside as it looks on the outside | The interior build quality was about a 5 | I test drove the 09' F150 and wanted the Lariat but couldnt afford it but the XLT for the price is a VERY nice truck quiet gas mileage is GREAT and the 4 | 6 ltr runs good | 
 "words": Throttle is very sluggish 5 | 4 V8 is lacking in power | Body fit is good except for rubber moldings | Moldings are also starting to oxidize from sun exposure | Truck is only three months old | Body is beer can thin dents very easily | Paint is the same way slightest scrap and you see metal | 
 "words": Was ready to buy a Toyota Tacoma when my wife said you can't buy a foreign truck | I immediately went to the Chevy dealership and then for some reason decided to stop buy a Ford one after that | Although I have always thought Chevy has a more classic and attractive body style I was blown away by the interior of the Ford | Simply put an outstanding and elegant design | It was a tough choice but was able to get a better price on the Ford and so went with it | So far I love the truck | Has a less powerful feel than the Chevy even through I got the 5 | 4L but it is still more than adequate for my needs | I have to thank my wife for pushing me to American better product than Toyota | 
 "words": It's a looker | After 1500 miles we think it's the best truck going | We like the style and features of our Lariat | It's capable and was built in America without help from a government handout | 
 "words": Traded an older F-150 and wanted a new truck that had the same features | I'm glad I did because it performs better than expected | I priced other trucks in the same class and found this new F- 150 has a far better exterior | It's quieter and the interior was tops for the money compared to a Dodge Chevy or GMC | First week after purchasing the truck it turned heads and had people coming up to me in parking lots just to say what a great looking truck it was | After a long drive with the family over 8 hours even my mother-in-law had to say that it's a hell of a truck in comfort ride and interior space | She even liked the look and price | 
 "words": Ford has really done there homework on this one | I traded in my 2007 Dodge Ram for my new 2009 F-150 the only thing I miss is the hemi engine | Other than the lack of a little power over the hemi this truck is light years better than the Dodge in every other way | This truck is fun to drive | The power from the new 5 | 4 is nothing to laugh at though | This will serve me just fine | The only thing I notice is the inside door panels push you in the truck to keep you away from the windows so as in an accident your not in the way of the side curtain air bags | This makes it just a little uncomfortable however nothing you couldn't get use to | Look around at this truck you'll find a lot of neat things | 
 "words": After 2 weeks of ownership I couldn't be happier with my decision | My previous truck was a 2002 F150 and the 2009 is light years ahead in refinement | I couldn't believe how quiet the truck is allmost as quiet as my wifes Toyota Highlander | The sync system is awesome hook up your Zune and everything is voice activated | I was concerned about the gas mileage coming from a 6cylinder to a V8 believe it or not I'm averaging close to 19mpg in mixed driving vs 15mpg with my old 6 cylinder | Build quality seems good no issues so far | Very happy with my decision | Would highly recommend a test drive for anyone trying to make a decision | Forgot to mention I received 5K in rebates when I purchased | 
 "words": This truck is the best truck I have owned | It is comfortable rugged can hold a lot and has conveniences that make it a pleasure for drivers of any age | No more skinned knees or sprained ankles getting into and out of the bed and the side steps make reaching into the front of the bed a snap | I really like the cargo management system to control movement of smaller loads | The seats are a notch above others in this class much more comfortable than the 2008 Tundra I just sold | Visibility is great even the radio sounds good | Having owned and driven well over 20 trucks over the years my comment that it is the best I have owned actually means something | Avg hwy miles 21 | 3 and city 14 | 2 |

 "words": WOW I thought my 2005 SuperCrew drove and rode nice this truck is awesome | The 5 | 4L has plenty of power and gets good gas mileage averaging 19 | 2 | It is so quiet and has so many great features and ideas encompassed in it like the improved tilt wheelmy 2005 tilt was the pits with that bulky handle underneath the column the improved tailgate extender that separates microsoft sync the compartment to the right of the steering wheel my Blackberry fits perfectly in the size of the interior I think you could sleep two back there comfortably the sony stereo it is just a greatly improved truck | Ford really out did themselves on this truck | 
 "words": Having owned five F series ford trucks since my '66 long bed | I am glad i got this 'puppy' | I had a bad experience with the 'T'-word truck | they are not trucks they the 'toys' are a joke | Ford trucks last in the long haul and can take highway punishment | The massive ford boxed frame is awsome the equally massive suspension system is a joy to behold | the power of the 4 | 6L is going to get me a ticket if i'm not careful | so get yourself a radar detector and use it | the cruise control is flawless | Yes as some have said the head rests stink just pop 'em out and turn 'em around problem solved | the middle 40-20-40 seat in the front bugged me so i took it out 4 13mm bolts | 
 "words": First Ford since 1988 | Wow | Never thought I'd come back | Ford has outdone itself with the new F150 Platinum | The 5 | 4 V8 power is good-not great | Averaging 17 mpg overall with 90 highway time | The interior fit finish is fantastic | Seats are super comfortable | Power running boards are a nice touch | At 6'7 the F150 has plenty of headroom compared to Tundra Chevy Cadillac | Towed 23' Airstream from Ohio to TN | Other than higher RPM's lower gas mileage the F150 barely knew it was back there | Averaged 13 MPG over 500 miles towing | Again great job Ford |

 "words": Traded a Chevy for a new Ford | This has the luxury for the needed night out and the toughness expected | The SYNC is great | I love the truck | My only problem so does my wife | 
 "words": Previously wrote a review | HEre's the bottom line | Love most things about the truck but here's my beefs after 1000 miles Platinum Version- I have a very bad back and initially thought the seats would be comfortable but between the fact that the steering wheel is such a long reach once seat and pedals adjusted all the way to the floor and because the top of the seat tilts forward it is not comfortable at all for more than 5 minutes- to 99 of people this would be no problem | Also the steering wheel has two problems- if you're tall like me 6'1 your knees will hit the back of the steering wheel kind of aggravating | This thing desperately needs telescopic wheel | Mileage in town 14
 "words": Well my 1985302fi finally went to help some concrete from falling down sadness | But alass i have found another truck to love for 300000 miles | The power when punched with the H | O | 4 | 6 is surprizing | It will cause ur wallet to empty at the tire store | The inside is a great update from my old tank | the sound from the 6 cd sirrus radio is beautiful | the seats are comfortable and the room is big enough for a dead body with the back seats up | the outside styling is another reason to buy this truck | the new styled tailgate that weighs half of the 85s and the chrome grill is an eye catcher | The new alloy wheels are another great update | I compare it to my 85 but the wife drives an '05 4dr | 
 "words": The new 6-speed automatic takes a little getting used to since the first 3 gears are spaced so close together 3rd gear by 20 mph | But it allows for better fuel mileage and towing so it's worth it | Yes as the other reviews have mentioned the stationary head rest takes some getting used to but it's rarely an issue | Very smooth ride quiet and stylish | The Lariat interior spring for the captain's chairs with the floor shift is very very nice | There are so many little features that add to the comfort of this truck that you'll still be discovering and appreciating them a few weeks in | Give it a test drive you'll be surprised how nice it is | 
 "words": Looked at everything on market- saw the competitive videos that Ford did that plus the fact that it is an IIHS Safety pick made the decision-even tough I liked the looks of the Dodge better | Go for the Platinum you get the deployable running boards infinitely adjustable tilt wheel and much more for less than 1G more than the KRanch | Others talked about the headrests they can be bent back out of the way w out hurting the seat | Only have about 275 miles all in town getting about 12mpg about as expected | This is one ritzy truck rides like a Caddy hauls like a Superduty | safe strong well built- can't go wrong | Will update later when I know more about MPG over long haul |

 "words": I just purchased a new 2009 Ford F-150 4x4 XL Regular Cab | I Love the truck except for 2 flaws in design | First | The head rests protrude out from the seat back about 5 inches which pushes your head in a lookdown position | The seat must be reclined back in order to level out your head so you are looking out the windshield instead of down at the bottom of steering wheel | I turned the headrests backwards which now has zero protection in the event of a rear collision but it now is comfortable | Secondly The 2 openings on either side of license plate has 2 brackets that Fords engineers have no clue of what they are for sitting there and is an eye sorethese holes are for extra cooling | The holes supposedly according to the engineers route extra air up to the radiator for engine cooling | If this is a fact Ford should have installed air intake ducts to direct air up to the front of radiator | not filled the back side with a rubber mat enclosing the area |
