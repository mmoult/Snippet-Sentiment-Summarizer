REVIEWS

 "words": Purchased used with only 12k miles | 2 | 4L toyota camry engine and 5 speed auto manual a great combination | This is not offered on the Toyota Matrix | GT model rims tires are nice but noisy on rough roads and you feel the bumps | Versatility and appearance are better than average | Handling is excellent because of full independent suspension wide low profile tires and sport tuned suspension | I did my research and compared to Matrix Versa Mazda-3 and Fit Vibe GT model won out for best combination fuel economy performance and SUV type features in a compact hatchback | GM warranty a plus 100K powertrain | Mileage should be around 30 on highway | 
 "words": This car does a little bit of every thing | I can haul a trailer put the seats down seat 4 adults 6 ft or taller and get good mileage | This car does it all | Pluses include room ceiling height get up and go mileage and style | The biggest negative is road noise just turn up the XM radio | 17000 miles after a year and 2 months of ownership just change the oil and rotate tires | MPG is 28-30 with mixed driving with quiet engine | The seats are comfortable and fit taller people well I'am 6 | 1 and can wear a hat | 
 "words":  Drives much better than the Cobalt I traded in for it | Some have mentioned blind spot but I think it's much easier to see out of than the Cobalt | 
 "words": Took my Vibe a rebadged Toyota Matrix in its first month of ownership on a road trip across the country after taking advantage of the Clunkers program | No major issues or squeaks and rattles have arisen yet | Have only changed the oil filter and added fuel injector cleaner so far | Was getting a fairly consistent 30 mpg of mostly highway driving with a fully loaded car bike hitch rack and a codriver who doesn't know how to smoothly modulate a gas pedal | Vibe has decent midrange punch with the 2 | 4 to pass and get up the hills | Glad I opted for the bigger engine Overall pretty happy with my purchase as the car has been both reliable and practical | For the money this car is hard to beat
 "words": Bought this car for my Daughter's first car | Looked at all the competitors and this 1 | 8L auto is a great balance of utility safety fuel efficiency and handling for the money 1500 rebate at the time | This toyota based car has reliability and same solid drive train I enjoyed with the Toyota Corolla that traded in | 
 "words": We drove mini-vans for years didn't need 3rd | seat anymore | We looked at many small wagons found the vibe superior for room for the price | Have averaged 33 | 4 MPG for 4200 miles- cityhighway | Very quiet-no wind or road noise | Shifts smooth with plenty pep-cruises at 70 MPH with ease | Have not been back to dealer for any problems | Too bad GM is quitting one of the best cars they have had | 
 "words": I bought this car 5 months ago to replace an SUV so was not sure about sitting lower to the road | I was pleasantly surprised by this Vibe | The drivers seat raises giving me some of the height I used to enjoy | This car is just fun to drive | Pick up is great handles well | My 17 year old loves to drive it too | I have not had a chance to try out the AWD yet but if my current satisfaction is any measure I know I will not be slowed by any snow |

 "words": I just purchased the 2 | 4 2009 vibe with manual trans | I offered 200 less than the TMV and they accepted my first offer to my surprise | Great car and if you want to buy one offer a ridiculously low amount to start with | They are practically giving these away with all the incentives | I wanted the 1 | 8L but couldn't find one | The 2 | 4 is more than enough power but I still get over 30 MPG with 50 50 driving so I'm very happy | Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable | Cargo space is great as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off | Sound system is great | I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it | Cash for clunkers program is a great deal | 
 "words": Purchased car end of May and have driven about 260 miles | Good mileage about 28 mpg with 50 city and 50 highway | Should improve with break in | 5 speed automatic shifts smoothly and 2 | 4 engine has plenty of pep | Comfortable and smooth ride | Would recommend | Vibe seemed to run smoother than its twin the Toyota Matrix and was priced better | 
 "words": I bought the 2009 Vibe with 1 | 8 liter engine and 4-speed automatic transmission | The power is sufficient and the gas mileage is excellent | The engine does not feel strained and remains quiet even at speeds above 80 mph | On the exterior the Vibe is somewhat better looking than its sister the Toyota Matrix | The interior is ergonomic comfortable and well designed | 
 "words": I had an 05 Vibe that I loved but had to trade-in after accident | The 09 Vibe has everything I loved about my 05 Vibe and more | The Stereo is excellent the handling and power is awesome | too awesome I got a speeding ticket before I hit 1000 miles on the car | I like the standard roof rack | the new cup holders are perfect and I like the fact that the cargo area has anti-slide strips | Also a nice addition is the recessed cargo hooks | It's a fantastic car for the price | 
 "words": Car is great looking and is great on fuel as well | The lights go on automatically when it gets dark and with the sun roof the Gt 2009 Pontiac Vibe is an eye catcher | So many people stop and look at the Vibe | Has so many neat items that all work very well | AC works great heater is great wiper at the rear window is great heater in the back window is helpful on a cold day to see things with the rear view mirror | Has a great radio and a jack to enter ones own music | Well all I got to say it is a great or nice car for almost anyone | 
 "words": I had a 2005 that I bequeathed to my graduating college senior | I knew I wanted another Vibe but was a little too late to get the last of the 2008s with the sweet rebates | 2009 Vibe is basically the same though the car's cosmetics have changed | There's no longer plastic cladding and bump strip nor the nearly useless roof rack standard | The change is supposed to be better looking but it looks more like a Prius or Versa now | Maybe not quite as young looking | The interior cosmetic changes are mostly an improvement but I really had no problems with the way it was before | Maybe the car is quieter now | Standard features in the 2009 make the slightly higher base price still a great value | 
 "words": After test driving the Highlander the Equinox and the Vue we test drove the new 2 | 4L FWD 2009 Vibe and drove it home | We have only owned it a week purchased 05 09 08 but have found it to be a practical but fun family ride | Gas mileage is as promised and should get better when the car is broken in | Great value for the money | 
 "words": I was researching a 2005-2007 Vibe and one could not be found that did not have extremely high miles | That should have told me something | I purchased my Vibe on 05 03 08 and absolutely love it | It is very fun to drive and handles great | 
 "words": I only have about 600 miles on this car as it was purchased in late April-08 | So far it has more than met my expectations | I traded in a large SUV that averaged about 14mpg | The 1st tank of gas I put in the Vibe averaged 26mpg and was all in town driving | I was very surprised that the 2 | 4-4 cyl engine had the pep that it does | It's a great car to drive | 
 "words": I had a 2005 vibe awd that was horrible in the snow etc | It was like it didnt even have awd so I traded it in quickly | I test drove the 2009 Vibe awd and it was much much much better in snow | Pricing is good but gm needs to put some incentive on it even Toyota is offering 0 percent on the Matrix | So I am waiting a bit to purchase unless the Subaru Forester comes out with some good incentive great car too first | Subis do have the best awd | I like the new vibe the 2 | 4 engine is a big big improvement over the 1 | 8 quiter peppier smoother | I do think they should offer the 5 speed auto Rather than the 4 speed with the awd | Mileage would be better get up to date gm and Toyota | 
 "words": A very nice way to put 14 minivan years behind me | Like minivans my Vibe is practical and versatile | Unlike minivans the Vibe is economical and fun to drive | But the Vibe GT is a few details short of perfect | I exchanged the 18-inch wheels standard on the GT for the 17-inch wheels optional on other models | I lost some tight cornering ability but gained a whole lot more in noise reduction and comfort | Blind spots force me to trust the mirrors more than I | d like | I had back-up sensors installed to allay fears that I would back into something or worse someone such as the grandchildren who live with us | I would have also appreciated an in-dash compass | Still a great ride and purchase | 
 "words": I had been researching new models Honda Fit Yaris and Versa when the 09 came out | Was pretty much set on a Nissan Versa | The Vibe was only about 2000 more than the Versa comparably equipped | With the added features not available on the Versa ABS disc brakes all around stability control traction control XM radio On Star and hands free phone it made the Vibe a very nice upgrade | I now have 1300 miles on it and have averaged 32 | 6 mpg 50-50 hwy cty | The 5-speed is very smooth and nicely placed high on the floor | Ride is great | performance is more than adequate while delivering excellent gas mileage | Really a nice car | 
 "words": I love my 2006 Vibe and purchased it due to the reliability in northern snow gas mileage the height of the seating head room and the ability of additional load capacity when the back seats are down | I also love the side covers that protect the bottom of the doors and around the tires where road rocks put pings on most autos and hurt the paint | Your new 2009 Vibe has changed most of the good features by lowering the height of the auto making it less apt to maneuver in deep snow | Lowered the angle of the windshield at a loss of head room and removed the protective side panels so the new 2009 would look sportier | 
 "words": Just traded '07 Tahoe thought the ride would be degraded but was happy to find this sub compact not small at all | Roomy and so much fun to drive can't believe a 4cyl could have so much pep | All my SUV neighbors can laugh but I'm laughing all the way to the bank | Excellent vehicle of choice with the changes taking place in our economy | 
 "words": I've had my Pontiac for a little over a month and I love it | It's the best Pontiac ever | It's great on gas which is a great thing when gas prices are so high | The salesman that sold it to me told me that the engine is a Toyota engine and I did my research and he wasn't lying | The car has the durability of Toyota on a great American design | 
 "words": Just a follow up to previous posting | One strange item missing from base models is variable intermittent wipers | After driving in the rain today and thinking that the option must be a separate add-on I went back and checked the Pontiac website to find that they are not available on the base model | For those living in rainy climates it's an annoying omission by the manufacturer | 
 "words": I have had my Vibe for a month and I love it | Quiet ride great fuel economy and fun to drive surprisingly quick handles well and great design | 
 "words": 2 | 4 engine really makes a difference a little roar under hard acceleration but overall quiet with a decent ride | Good value for a mini crossover | Better seats than before and improved driving position w added tilt tele | Brakes stopped ok | Should receive more attention this year from people of all ages because of value and utility | Definitely upgrade to the 2 | 4 | 
 "words": Purchased a base model with automatic | Compared to previous generation model improvements in interior ergonomics and performance were immediately evident | I especially appreciate that the car comes standard with side air bags StabiliTrak OnStar even in the least expensive model | Standard sound system is wonderful and includes XM radio | Overall I'm extremely happy to be a new Vibe owner | 
 "words": as much fun as my 2006 civic but more practical | I have a 2 | 4 with 5 spd auto which wasn't a choice on the drop down menu on this website | Just got back from a 5000 km road trip and got about 39 mpg Canadian I rated the reliability high but really don't have the mileage to prove that although the warranty is by Canadian standards very generous | 
 "words": This is the 4th AWD drive Vibe I have owned | I had to purchase it sight unseen since my '05 lease was ending | I was delighted to hear that Pontiac was bring the AWD back since it is such a fun easy efficient car to do errands around town | I only have 200 miles on it so I suppose I need a little time to adjust | It is attractive outside and I love the bright red | Inside as a 5 foot tall women I am still bothered by the lowering of the rear view mirror to accommodate the Onstar system and the repositioning of the front right roof columns along with the larger side mirrors | These 3 things seem to change my sight lines-they are different than my others models | 
 "words": I've had my '09 Vibe for about a month and really enjoy it | I have a GT w the 4sp automatic | The vehicle is responsive with excellent acceleration and the steering is tight and active | We've already taken a weekend road trip with the vehicle and comfortable carried my wife child dog and all the necessary gear associated with the aforementioned | On the highway we achieved 30 MPG in town around 25 MPG | The ride is very smooth and quiet with minimal road noise | There are no squeaks and rattles so far which drive me crazy and the fit and finish is clean and tight | Storage room is ample for compact car | 
 "words": My husband and I just got our 2009 Vibe GT and this car is so fun to drive | We have had the car for 6 days and I have put on 450 miles | 
 "words": I have just purchased a new 2009 Vibe with optional auto manual shift package 17 chrome rims rear spoiler and other little misc | options as well | The car is definitely worth its weight in gold I traded in my 2003 Grand Am and am very impressed that Pontiac has stuck with the great responsive sport like steering | The car overall has great body lines interior is comfortable and the fold down rear seats including the passenger are a great feature | The overall pick-up response of the car is very impressive especially in manual mode where you can get the few extra RPM's when wanting to get that race feel | Overall you can feel the great quality everytime you get behind the wheel | 
 "words":  I've only had this car for 2 weeks | It's so much fun to drive and handles like a much more expensive vehicle | The ride is quiet and smooth and the 2 | 4 engine provides more than enough power | The interior seems spacious and all the controls are in easy access | The interior uses alot of plastic however it does not look or appear cheap | The seats are very comfortable in the front and rear and the cargo space is incredible when the rear seats are folded down | The A C blows nice and cold which is a plus since I live in Florida | I wanted the upgraded radio but mine has the base radio however it sounds great | I've driven in some very heavy rain and this car was terrific | GREAT CAR | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Vibe the first being an 05 which was a great vehicle | This one easily surpasses that | Very smooth and quiet by comparison with good power | Fuel mileage has been outstanding | With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up even though we weren't in the market for a new car | However my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one | We're extremely pleased again | Can't believe GM won't be offering this vehicle any more | Major mistake | Please reconsider GM | 
 "words": I must admit that I too was driving my Vibe for the first week in third gear not realizing that 3rd gear is left and 4thoverdrive is right at the same position on the automatic shifter | That erases my earlier comment on the need for a 4forwardspeed transmission as the 1 | 8L Vibe has one | not sure I understand the comment about the noisy ride as mine drives quietly -certainly less noise than in the '03 version | Looking forward to 200K miles in this vehicle | 
 "words": This is our second Vibe an '04 and an 08 but this one has the big engine and flies | It handles like a sports car beats college students from light to light has a great sounding stereo love the XM stations is so roomy I can load my entire art display in it and just bungee the hatch door down to travel is comfortable on long drives which I love now that this car in under me it looks beautiful with the black pearl paint sunroof and spoiler and the wheels get admiring looks now that I took out the center plastic hubs for a sportier look | 
 "words": I waited for the AWD to return in 2009 and am happy I did | Nice tight steering it has more pickup than my 6 cyl Stratus the AWD plows through snow like a champ | Lots of cargo space and super-versatile layout | I can fit almost anything that would have fit in my Blazer | CONS I wish the Vibe offered more options | In this day and age it | s crazy that you can | t get power seats even if you want them | Like others I noticed the chippy paint but thought it was due to living on a rocky dirt road | Also everyone is raving about the milage- it | s ok but I think a car of this size could do better | Overall I LOVE it | This is a great car for the money and I would happily buy another | 
 "words": The Vibe by far is the roomiest and best-riding car in its class and it is very fun to drive | Having previously driven a Suburban surprisingly I do NOT feel like my bottom is dragging on the ground | This car was purchased primarily for driving around town with kids in tow | There is plenty of room in the back for them being in car seats | My dog even enjoys riding in the trunk | For those of you who think the Vibe is comparable to the Dodge Caliber you're thinking WRONG | I drove the Caliber and the Vibe in the same day and there is NO comparison | The fuel economy is also great | I just filled up my tank in the Vibe and calculated 26 mpg city driving in 3rd gear | see improvements
 "words": This is my second Vibe -my first is an '03 with 103K miles which my teenage son will inherit | The '03 has been flawlessly reliable | I purchased the '09 last week at an incredible deal 4300 off in GM Driver's Edge card rebates 3000 in additional rebates for paying cash and at a price that was well below invoice | I was a little concerned that Pontiac parts might not be available in the long haul but GM insures me that Vibe owners will be supported for years to come | Since the power train is Toyota I am not concerned | If you are shopping for a reliable vehicle that gets great mpg Vibe is the way to go | 
 "words": I find it difficult to give this car much of a rating | I take my dog with me most everywhere I go so I decided on the Vibe based on its size and practicality | I am very disappointed | This is by far the noisiest vehicle I have every owned | I find myself checking the windows to see if I left one of them open | There seems to be no sound deadening insulation in this vehicle at all | This makes long trips very tedious and also makes listening to music impossible | Also the AWD model should be available with a manual transmission the automatic doesn't allow you to coast freely it's always holding you back causing you to play with the accelerator to hold a constant speed | 
 "words": All I can say is that anything would have suited me fine after having driven a Daewoo Lanos | But I always admired the Pontiac Vibe for its adorable design since the first time I ever saw it | These new defined designs of the car is just stunning | I've got the GT and I love how this car looks | As an art major it has been just spectacular having so much cargo space to haul my sculptures and oversized paintings | Very reliable car not to mention it is crazy fun to drive | One thing I thought was great about the car was the magnificent interior design but this is coming from someone who used to have cup holders directly under the radio so I guess there's room for improvement on that note | 
 "words": MPG 30 | 5 mixed | Comfortable spacious nice | tall | driving stance solid feeling good 4 wheels disk brakes fun-easy to drive | Electric steering wheel is somewhat different but ideal for every day operation | All of the important features especially safety are there | Well thought out interior including 120V outlet and exterior plastic molding are in the right places and may better resist winter salt | The engine is not too responsive when driven softly but wakes up when RPM 2000 | BTW this Toyota engine is used by the Lotus Exige sport car | A fifth gear would be nice on the highway | My wife loves it | I take very opportunity to drive it | 
 "words": I traded in a Toyota truck just because of payments but I love Toyota | When I read that the Vibe was essentially a Toyota I went to the dealer because everything I read was good | I have never had a small car so I was hesitant but this car is actually fun to drive and the MPG is awesome right now I'm getting 28-30 in combo driving | Yes the wheel caps fall off and yes the ride is bumpy but I am not sorry I traded except when I needed a half ton of mulch last week | 
 "words": This the third Vibe we've owned and each one has had exceptional gas mileage | The last Vibe got 30 | 1 miles per gallon for 29000 miles | This 2009 is averaging over 30 miles per gallon too | Repairs have only required service oilfiltertire rotation and alignment on the 2006 model | The 2009 has only 3000 miles and has had no repairs as of yet | On the 2009 model I miss the carpeting on the deck in back the shade covering that area along with the intermittent window washer | Other wise the 33 | 2 miles per gallon on a recent trip is great | I hate to see the Pontiac line disappear | Maybe they will give the vehicle to Chevrolet for a boost in their division car mileage requirements | 
 "words": My 1st American-made car purchase in 30 years | That plus GM's pending doom made me hesitant about purchasing an '09 Vibe but glad we did | Traded the AWD of a Forester for the mpg of a Vibe | Very happy after the first month | The 1 | 8l with std transmission is a little slow off the line but has plenty of windup once you pass 3000 rpm | Nice quite ride | 35 mpg highway | 28 mpg in town | Yakima canoe rack fits the roof fine | 
 "words": Pros Toyota Engine -Great gas mileage -Sporty look Cons Noise every time you go from park to drive and start to move | It is the anti-lock breaks kicking in | Drove three others | Same thing | Dealer said it was not designed very well because you could hear it kicking in | XM radio cuts song title information off | I had XM 5 years ago and my radio could display the entire song | Cuts it off even if you switch to non-flashing mode and have to push info button | Bad design | Doors make a slight vibrating noise when closing them | Again tried 3 others and same thing | Body design flaw Little noises coming from the dash area even when driving on a smooth highway or road
 "words": I have owned this little gem for a year and have just turned 30000 miles on it yesterday | This car is very fun to drive and is dependable | The only trouble I have had is that the center caps on rims came off | GM will only pay for them once then you are on your own | 16 | 50 a piece Also some sensor that controls the electronics went out | That means that I did not have any ABS Traction Control stabili-Trac | Covered under warranty | All in all this car has been great | I consistently get 30 MPG | 
 "words": I've owned my very fun-to-drive Vibe GT for 2 weeks and so far I love it although I agree with others that there are a few things that it could use improvements which keep it from being a 10 | I love the styling compared to its competitors much cooler looks compared to Versa Matrix Fit '10 Mazda3what did they do to this car's front end | I love the value | it has everything you need a few great extras and you can get a loaded GT for 19K if you shop around again better than the competition | Nice standard extras are Monsoon w XM radio OnStar steering wheel controls leather accents ABS traction 18 alloys | Also love the cargo versatility of the hatchback | 
 "words": Car is attractive roomy and has lots of pep all with great mpg expect 35 mpg highway or more | Sound system is average | For the money you can't go wrong and basically it's a Toyota in disguise | 
 "words": Traded in my '08 Pontiac G5 had tons of probs for '09 Vibe bc of the wonderful ratings I had read on the '08's | wish I would not have | Has been a dependable car but I haven't enjoyed having it since I bought it | Seems to be a step down from my car that I had previously | Road noise is terrible inside of car | Maybe I am just used to my super quite G5 couldn't even hear it on while inside but I have to continuously turn up radio as I increase speed so I can hear it | Odometer does not give me read out of how many mpg I am currently getting how many miles I have until I am out of gas or what of oil life I have left | These 2 have been big adjustment for me | 
 "words": I bought my vibe in January and it does a great job in the snow of Michigan | It is fun to drive and has tons of space | It is also extremely comfortable and great for long drives |

 "words": I purchased my Vibe GT in Oct | 08 and have since put 10000 miles on it | I find the car very fun to drive and nibble in city traffic much more so than my old Pontiac Trans Am GTA | The 2 | 4L has plenty of power to do just about any task you ask it | The interior home is amazing for a small car and the cargo area is more than spacious | Driving in snow and ice is a breeze at times you almost forget it should be slick conditions | The fuel economy has been pleasing with an average of 28 mpg | I have had as high as 31 mpg and nothing lower than 24 mpg | It's a great sporty little car with economy in mind | 
 "words": I picked the 2 | 4L base automatic over several other models | I have 7000 miles on it | I have had several issues with it the center caps kept coming offthe steering column had a noise in it when it hit a bump | The dealership found the electronic box on the bottom of steering wheel is bad and now the dashboard pieces that were taken off will not snap together | The plastic clips seem to be very brittle they break off easy | The XM radio is great as long as you don't go through mountains or valleys or even under shade trees signal will go out | The 2 | 4 has lot of power would not recommend 1 | 8 | I've been averaging 26 mpg city 35 mpg | highway | The wheels make car stand out | 
 "words": I bought this car to replace my 1999 SC1 Saturn | I was looking at the Toyota Matrix but the Vibe is the same car and I got a better deal | The ride is real smooth and is very easy to park in tight places | The only real gripe is you can not turn off the headlights even in park | Most cars come with a off switch for the automatic lights but this car does not have the capability | 
 "words": We test drove a number of other small sedans hatchbacks before deciding to purchase a Vibe | The ride quality and offered features seemed to be a cut above the rest of the pack | However so far we are not too impressed with the build quality center wheel caps fell off sunroof leaks rear view mirror vibrates paint easily scratched | instrument panel rattles squeaks in cold weather | Also the gas mileage is only OK averaging 24 mpg in mixed driving | Traction in the snow seems to be reasonably good | 
 "words": I bought a 2004 Vibe in 2004 and loved it from day one | The fuel economy and versatility was just what my family needed | Never had a minutes trouble with the car | I recently traded the 04 in for an 09 | Once again I loved it from day one | This time I upgraded to the GT model and was not disappointed | It handles great drives smooth and quiet and has a little more get up and go than the base model | I highly recommend it to families who need a good reliable car that gets good gas mileage and has lots of room |

 "words": Bought a 1 | 8 liter in March for my wife | I liked it so much that when I found a used one on the internet I went and bought it | Did not realize it was a 2 | 4 liter | Has more power that the 1 | 8 but fuel economy is still good approx 27 city driving |

 "words": I purposefully chose the 1 | 8l for it's higher gas mileage and have been getting 31 mpg combined so far | I wish some of the upper models were avail with the smaller engine 2 | 4 is overkill and eliminates the point of a small efficient hauler | The main competition was the Astra and I'm sad that the Pontiac isn't nearly as peppy for the same engine size and that it doesn't shift anywhere as smoothly | That said I like the layout of the interior a lot everything is where I expect not something I could say for the astra and the price was sure right | The cargo area is great but really needs a dome light | I love that it's ipod ready and the AC works like a charm | It's a very comfy ride |
