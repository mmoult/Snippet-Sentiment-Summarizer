REVIEWS
 "words": I'm 6ft 4in with a 34 inch waist not that big but I find the driver's seat very uncomfortable | It's too small and the outside ridges are too hard | I've driven older Honda Pilots and liked them which is one reason we bought a new one | Don't know what they changed but it was not for the better | My wife has no problem but if you're my size or larger beware | 
 "words": Purchased in Jan 09 after much looking and reading | I read so many complaints about the styling that I almost did not buy it | I traded a Landcruiser because I was looking for something with better gas mileage and economy | I love my Pilot | Once you are in the car you forget about the boxy style | I am getting twice the gas mileage as in my previous car | It is a safe fun reliable car to drive | I bought the 4wd for traveling off road later | I plan to keep my Pilot for many years | Service has been very good | 
 "words": Just returned from a 3500 mile trip | At real world Interstate speeds 75-76 mph I was able to squeeze out 21 | 5 mpg | A bit low but this is a big box | Suspension is a bit too stiff and with a truck type tire and stiffer steering than our previous two vehicles '07 Pacifica '02 Highlander you never feel like you're 'part of the vehicle' | Bucket seats are firm but comfortable | Plenty of cubby holes and storage compartments but interior trim materials are hard to the touch and unattractive | Sound system is just 'OK' | '02 Highlander sound system has better features | Glad we leased | Engine Mgmt | system works well | No discernible sensation when system shuts down or turns on cylinders | 
 "words": I have had my '09 pilot touring 4WD since May 2009 now | We love the interior space with 8 seats | We do not like the plastic on dash board and the whitish center console backing | The Handling can use a lot of work but it's a Honda I guess they think that I will be spending another 20k to make it look feel like a BMW anyways so why bother | - I really did not think that their EPA mileage will be that much off | It says 16 20 18 city highway combined avg but I am getting just about 250 miles for a full tank of gas that's about 12 MPG | WOW | 
 "words": I've had my Pilot about 7 months now and have had it on a 3000 mile trip to Colorado and back I live in California | The Pilot has plenty of power even in the mountains I averaged 23 | 4 mpg on that trip even with the cruise set at 75mph which is the legal speed limit in Nevada Utah and Colorado on the Freeways | I did take it out of cruise when climbing long grades the transmission shifts too much if left in cruise | I was driving 12 hour days and did not get tired at all the Pilot is very comfortable | even around town I get little better than 15 mpg | It does drift to the right if you take your hands off the wheel | But most 4WD's I have driven do the same thing | I'm very happy with my Pilot | 
 "words": Looked at the Toyota Highlander and Mazda CX-9 which simply did not stand up to the size and features of the 2009 remodeled Pilot | Bought the Pilot in September of 2008 and have been very happy so far with no problems | Towed a tent camper trailer without any problems hardly knew the trailer was behind us did not have any issues with sway | 
 "words": We looked around very hard before buying our Pilot and we believe that we got the best for our money | Sure there are other SUV that are better in some areas but the Pilot got our vote because overall it had the most for the money | It stops very fast if you are driving at high speed | It rides smooth compare to others | It is roomier than others and it carries a lot more than what the brochure says trust me we have tried | Fuel consumption is better than what the brochure says | It does get 25mpg on the highway and fully loaded with 5 people it still gets 24mpg | We just love it | 
 "words": Before buying this I did long test drives of Toyota Highlander and Pilot back to back | Although the Highlander has better looks pickup and performance the steering response was non-existent it was like playing a video game | Also the space after the last row on the Highlander was minimal and the last row did not have a split seat | Pilot on the other hand did not have great pickup but once you get to the highway speeds it performed remarkably well | The ride quality and steering response were excellent | The utility factor is awesome with 110v outlet ipod link etc | Also I sat much more comfortably and had a better view of the road than the Highlander | Overall a great family SUV | 
 "words": I got my first Honda Truck in January | My PILOT EXL 4WD 500 | 00 a month | I love my truck quiet powerful roomy and well design | I like everything about the Pilot | You get your money's worth | 
 "words": We've been happy with our Pilot | We're hooked on the XM radio love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior | We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is 181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper | Even more disappointed that the connector under the bumper is a goofy connector that NOBODY carries yet | Happy over all though | We'll just wait to buy a harness from someone not trying to rip off a customer for an overpriced set of wires | Happy with the handling but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed
 "words": This was my first SUV and I love it | I've always owned sports cars so it as a bit tough to choose which SUV was practical | It was a decision between the Ford Edge or the Pilot | After test driving the Pilot I took it home the same night | Within days i was getting acquainted quite well with my Pilot | The interior is very roomy perfect especially when you have kids or to jam a bunch of your friends for a weekend getaway | Not too happy with the mileage but expected for an SUV | I've already taken my pilot to the nation's capital from NJ for a break in | It was smooth riding all the way down even with icy and hazardous road conditions on I95 | Overall this vehicle is safe and reliable | 
 "words": I just traded in my 2006 Pilot for the 2009 because I could not find a 2008 SE in my area | That being said I read all of the reviews and was quite hesitant but so far I am pleasantly surprised and happy with the vehicle | It is definitely geared more toward its competitors of the Pathfinder and 4Runner in that it drives much more like a truck which will be a disappointment for anyone looking for the new Pilot to be exactly like the old | With that being said its overall functionality is much more than the previous models in that it is much more spacious heavy duty and an all around family vehicle | 
 "words": After two road trips and a full tank of gas I'm very happy | With 3-4 adults and 2 kids the car accelerates well for the type of car it is and has some good climbing power | Very smooth and very quiet | As far as cylinders shutting off you can feel it only if you're really paying attention and looking for it otherwise pretty seamless | After a few test drives as well as an additional 300 miles in I'd say the braking feels as responsive as you need it to be smooth when you need a gradual stop and firm when you need to shed speed quickly | I feel very safe and comfortable in this car yet it's a great pleasure to drive | Compares favorably against the Lambdas Acadia Outlook etc | 
 "words": This vehicle has power and a beautiful smooth ride | I drove fords for years and find this vehicle to be exceptional in quality ride and feel | The Pilot has a wider wheel base than my Explorer and rides deep into a turn so you remain seated at normal speeds | I get very little if any pitch and roll from the suspension | The car is very stable | Lots of interior space as well | The looks of the car are not great but that is the only part I would want improved | I STRONGLY recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": This is the first Honda I have owned | I have a wife soon will have 3 kids a dog and a boat that we need to pull | Looked at everything that seated more than 5 people had decent fuel economy and could pull a reasonable sized boat | Honda was last on my list to look at but when we did we ended up buying it | So far we really like it | We get about 17 mpg city and as much as 21 mpg on the highway | Lots of room in the inside good storage comfortable | We are impressed | The closest competitor would be a Toyota Highlander and it doesn't hold a candle to the Pilot | 
 "words": My family I are really enjoying our Pilot | It's much better than my 06 Frontier crewcab | It's true that the interior materials are not as upscale as other Honda vehicles compared to my wife's 07 CR-V or a new Accord but it's not offensive at all I like it just fine | Braking has been great for me in real-world conditions | Power has never been a problem | I pass merge with ease | Sprung for the DVD our daughter loves it | Seats are very comfortable | Cylinder shutoff is noticeable takes some getting used to | Road noise is minimal | Wonderful little details included in the design such as the grocery hooks cargo net hill assist | Sound system is clear crisp but not as good as expected | 
 "words": The fuel economy is a farce plain and simple | We have had the car for 1500 miles and have not averaged over 14 | 5 mpg | Not to mention that you can | t drive this vehicle over 75 as the body roll is unsafe | Other items to be aware of the cargo area slope is a really bad idea | The remote locking system must be unlocked again to open hatch and can't click to lock if any door is still open | The lack of adjustment in the passenger | s seat as well as heat only on the seat not the back of the passenger seat | Not the easiest to get into the 3rd row | The noise at highway speed | Park sensors that aren | t on the front of the front bumper so you could pull into something straight on without warning | 
 "words": Relative to other vehicles we test drove we simply found the Pilot a cut above anything else out there for the money we had budgeted | This vehicle replaces a 2002 CRV so it's obvious an upgrade | Feature-wise we're quiet happy with it | We looked seriously at Saturn Outlook 2006 Pilot and Toyota Highlander | Outlook from a driver's view just didn't feel right | Highlander felt pretty decent but didn't care for fit for passengers in 3rd row | 2006 Pilot felt great from a driving standpoint but felt like it had less leg room in 2nd row than our CRV | After two test drives on the 09 Pilot and there was little doubt | This was a smart pick | 
 "words": We set out to buy a Saturn Outlook but after test driving all the competitors took a look at the 2009 Pilot just to rule it out | Immediately we had to have it | Don't know what the fuss is with the styling we like it from every angle | We have the Mocha Metallic ext | with beige leather and think it is a very classy combination | I love the drivetrain | With concentration I can feel the VCM but it is very imperceptible | Ride is very smooth without being floaty | Handles great | Very solid feeling doors slam shut like a Mercedes | Awesome seats and features for the money | Would not mind another couple mpg but easy on gas for a lg | vehicle | Love the dual exhaust looks and sound | 
 "words": This 2009 Honda Pilot has been a real disappointment | With approx | 5200 miles since new in August 2008 we are not pleased with the over all quality | At less than 1000 miles the rear windshield wiper assembly flew off when I turned it on | The battery has died twice while parked with everything off | This happened at approx 3200 miles and just this week with 5000 miles | The side trim panel on the drivers side door next to the window fell off | The entire vehicle rattles and squeaks as if there were 105000 miles on it Our 02 SAAB 03 VW are quiet | The right front passenger seat is jerky when you use the forward-back adjustment | The shift lever make operating or tuning the radio uncomfortable | 
 "words": This vehicle has been great and I have recommended it to friends | The tire pressure fuel and service notices are very helpful | This car is smart and takes the headache away from the driver | The turn radius is impressive | This car is smooth to drive and the entertainment including speakers and listening to music makes travel fun from taking kids to practice to driving coworkers at lunch | Reliable easy to drive and park and looks and feels like a luxury vehicle | The new grille looks good | I also have the leather seats that are heated which I think not only look good but are also comfortable | 
 "words": My wife wanted an SUV this time around since we drive in various weather conditions | Love the Pilot so far | It's surprisingly roomy and the features are outstanding | We had looked at most SUVs on the market and chose this one | We've had it 1 month now and I'm watching to see what the mpg will be | Got 20 | 5 avg on our first 500 mile trip at 73 mph | Like to see a little better but I'll give it time to break in | Still have to read the book occasionally to figure things out | 
 "words": I really like the 09 Pilot with the exception of the excessive road tire noise at highway speeds | A vehicle in this price range should be reasonably quiet this vehicle is not | The noise has become a real issue with my wife and me to the point that we may have to get rid of the vehicle which is too bad as I think it would be a great car it not for the noise
 "words": Great SUV for the feature set navi RES sunroof leather Class III hitch back-up camera back-up sensors and climate control you will not find a better SUV on the market for the price | I test drove the Lexus RX Mazda CX-9 Nissan Pathfinder and the Toyota Highlander and none came close to the price with the Touring models feature set | Add on Honda's build quality and you have a perfect combination | 
 "words": Wow this was quite the upgrade from our last vehicle so it was a little overwhelming with all the options that came with the 2009 Touring with RES | Still haven't figured out everything | I was surprised at the size of it when I pulled it into the garage | This vehicle is huge in a good way | The 8 person seating capability is great | Bluetooth phone is great for my wife who can't drive hold a phone at the same time | The navigation unit far surpasses the portable one I just bought | I hope my enjoyment of the car continues for many years | I see no major issues yet | 
 "words": I purchased the car in Aug 08 | and was extremely happy with the car until two days later | I noticed that the steering would pull to the right | I was told it was the crown in the road | Having insisted on something being done a number of adjustments were made and it drives better | The next issue which has me pondering trading the car inis noise heard from the gas tank | When the gas tank is full I can hear the gas sloshing around and it makes a loud thumping noise | The dealership stated this was due to the design of the gas tank and a condition of the car | Take the opportunity to turn off your radio and drive around | Otherwise it has great space and a comfortable ride | Gas mileage is ok | 
 "words": Some of this is about purchase experience but there are a few issues with the vehicle | Mileage count on getting a full 1 3 less than promised | Driving as gently and efficiently as I can I can't get over 12 | 4 | Nimbleness it has decent turn radius and good handling on the road but is really over sized in parking both getting into spaces and opening doors when parked | Stupid remote locking system must unlock again to open hatch and can't click to lock if any door open | Maybe configurable but haven't figured out | Finally watch out for Honda Leasing | Closed with 0 | 15 per excess mile on 3 year then called back in to sign new contract at 0 | 20 | Wouldn't have leased at that rate | 
 "words": Thought I would contribute a review to try to assist others with the agonizing decision I made one that I am very happy I made to go with a 2009 Honda Pilot 4wd Touring over the Highlander Xterra and Pathfinder and CX-9 | Many object to the looks of the Pilot we like it lot | looks like a real SUV | This vehicle is the clear choice for those looking for the utmost utility safety modern conveniences and medium- duty off-road capability yes that is what the Pilot's chassis unibody structural integrity and suspension are designed for reasonable fuel efficiency and highly functional hopefully reliable 4WD system | Pilotbest value content going for the mighty beefy S CUV | 
 "words": After testing several mid-sized utes traded in my 04 4-runner | I have owned Hondas in the past so expected the quality | What surprised me was how solid and capable it feel's driving on rutted out washboard dirt roads-a big plus for an avid kayaker mtn | biker all around outdoor enthusiast in western Montana | On road handling was good enough but much improved with a set of aftermarket 18 in wheels and upgraded tires and still rides smooth on and off road | Factory side steps and rack help break up a somewhat frumpy design and along with the aftermarket wheels gives the pilot a much sportier demeanor | I'm really impressed with the quality technology and overall driving dynamic's | 
 "words": I bought this to carry my big family around and it does the job right | The back side look makes it look like a Van rather than an SUV but the front design proves it wrong | All of a sudden my wheel lights are showing up even though my tire pressure is good | Also the Oil change light popped up once in a while | The door light also showed up once I was driving and the doors locked | 
 "words": I traded in my '03 EX-L Pilot for a new '09 EX-L model | The '03 was very dependable | In comparison the '09 has a much smoother more quiet ride | Road noise has been reduced dramatically | There are more standard options and features on the new model | I am having to get use to the VCM technology | There is noticeable hesitation when the vehicle changes cylinder rotation | Some reviews have given the Pilot bad marks on the lack of V6 power | This has not been an issue with me | The dash layout is well thought out with the button locations and instrument panel | The dash read-out message screen is pretty neat with clear and easy to read information | Visibility is good | Got 22 MPG on first road trip | 
 "words": This was our first SUV purchase and so far we love the Pilot | We looked at almost every mid size SUV on the market and decided on the Pilot | This is also our first Honda | 
 "words": Replaced a horrible GMC Safari with the Honda Pilot | Should have done it sooner | Took pilot on a 500 mile trip to Myrtle Beach and got 22 MPG during break in | Fit finish reliability on ours has been perfect 1500 miles so far | Rides quiet and smooth sometimes I think it has shut off sitting at a light | Mileage is as advertised although the mileage readout feature on dash can teach you to be light-footed and bump the mileage up some AWD gets close to 16 in stop and go commute and close to 23 mpg on I-95 with its occasional slowdowns | Turning radius makes it easy to handle | Seating comfort and room is 100 better in 2009 than 2008 | 
 "words": When I had my 08 4WD EXL w Nav Pilot at the dealership I made the mistake of looking at the 09 | Most expensive dealer service I've ever had because I bought an 09 4WD Touring w Nav and RES a week later | I liked my 08 and it was serviceable but I didn't love it | Everything I would have changed about the 08 Honda changed for 09 | The joystick Nav system is so much better than the touchscreen | I LOVE THIS CAR and it's a Honda | This is my 4th Honda | Can't beat their reliability | 
 "words": When I had my 08 4WD EXL w Nav Pilot at the dealership I made the mistake of looking at the 09 | Most expensive dealer service I've ever had because I bought an 09 4WD Touring w Nav and RES a week later | I liked my 08 and it was serviceable but I didn't love it | Everything I would have changed about the 08 Honda changed for 09 | The joystick Nav system is so much better than the touchscreen | I LOVE THIS CAR and it's a Honda | This is my 4th Honda | Can't beat their reliability | 
 "words": The steering on my brand new 2009 2WD Pilot was pulling to the right the first day off the lot | At first I thought it was the road but the pull was consistent on all road surfaces | After calling the dealer I discovered that Honda did not redesign the springs for the all-new 2009 Pilot and as a result the alignment problems are becoming prevalent | Here's the problem the 2009 models have more weight distribution in the front compared to 2008 models and heavier springs should have been used | The dealer indicated they needed Honda approval to fix the problem | The fix consists of replacing the right front spring with a rear spring from a 2009 4WD model | 
 "words": Was looking at the Highlander and was totally surprised by the great deal Honda was offering on these | Very comfortable and I love the room and cargo configurations | Cabin is slick | Heating controls are kind of an odd design but you get used to it | I think the Highlander ride was smoother and more car like but the Pilot takes bumps well enough | Very versatile | Road trips tailgating cargo hauling towing included | Its great for just about anything | MPG is about as advertised not great | So far so good | I'm very happy with my choice | 
 "words": We purchased our Honda Pilot last week and so far we love it | The interior design is wonderful and there is plenty of room | The new exterior looks great | The quality of the leather and plastic are nice | So far we are averaging 17 | 3 miles but we have only driven 200 miles and I am sure after the break in period our average should improve | 
 "words": We compared to the other suvs this was clearly the best value and performance has been excellent | However we strongly advise a longer than 30 minute test drive | At about 15 minute your back will start sweating | I had leather seats in every car since 1980 and never have we sweat so much | I cringe at the thought of driving anywhere over 20 minutes | Add to the cost of reupholstering and the value drops significantly | 
 "words": Just traded my 2005 Pilot for 2009 Touring with Nav and DVD | Looked at MDX RX350 X5 CX-9 and Murano | This is much better than the others | 
 "words": I know I made the right choice the minute I sat in the Pilot | I loved the new design and all the features it has to offer all included as standard depending on the model you choose | It has an amazing amount of room smooth ride and lots of storage | Compared it to the Highlander and the Acura MDX and know I made the right choice | Go for it | You won't be sorry | 
 "words": This new vehicle is so exciting to drive and to ride in | Comfort and safety are hallmarks | One feels so secure in traveling in this truck | Being a truck one feels confident to be able to haul heavy without loosing control due to overweight | I could not have purchased a better vehicle | 
 "words": I debated between purchasing a Highlander and the Pilot and I am glad I chose the Pilot | The Pilot comes standard with a trailer hitch and a comparably equipped Highlander is about 3-4K more and Toyota charges 600 over and above for a hitch | The Pilot is smooth in it's acceleration and ride | The interior design is extremely well thought out and has tons of storage | The new design is much beefier heavier more masculine looking which I love | You get a lot of great features for your money with this vehicle | 
 "words": Like my past Accords everything is where it should be and makes sense | I trade an Acura MDX and the Pilot is every bit as comfortable and well appointed | Only disappointment was having to live with Good Year tires and not Michelins | Looking forward to many years of enjoyable driving and hauling | Total deal consumed around 5 hours from beginning to delivery it should be far shorter but that is the car business |

 "words": I just picked up my new Pilot after researching all the SUVs | We have an Odyssey that has held up for the last 3 yrs without a problem so decided to look at the new Pilot | I am glad I did as I was close to buying a Highlander | The technology and design of this truck were well thought out | The handling is solid plenty of power to get going | Lots of Room for the kids and their stuff | Fuel economy so far hgwy was 23 | 3 | The truck performs wellis very smooth | The turn radius is incredible | Buy this truck if you need room and luv tech toys | 
 "words": This is my second Honda Pilot I liked my 2005 even though I thought the styling was blah | I get all the equipment I can get on my vehicles and the only thing I left off this one was the rear entertainment and AWD neither of which I need or want | This Pilot is fantastic | I'm getting 20 mpg in town and 26 on the highway I'm a grandmother that doesn't hot-rod | It's luxurious and that's what I was looking for | I do agree that the glove compartment is stingy with room but it's a minor flaw | The Navi drives me nuts but I'll get used to it | Can't learn to trust the back-up camera still need to look first | Thanks Honda you did it again | 
 "words": Love the vehicle | To christen the purchase my wife and I and our three surviving 80-year-old parents left on a 700-mile round trip getaway | The five of us were amazed at how much comfort and privacy were afforded by the third row seating combined with the rear entertainment system | My mother 5 | 4 | sat in the third row the entire trip and concluded that the rearmost seat was just as comfortable as the second row | Gas mileage has been decent for a vehicle of this type 22 mpg on the trip with 5 adults luggage | 19 mpg mixed city highway | 16 mpg city-only driving | 14 | 5 mpg city-only with poor driving habits | 
 "words": Handles great sound system with the exl-res dvd system is fantastic because you get the 510 Watt premium sound system with it as opposed to dealer installed dvd system | Also if you you join aaa you get a great price from participating dealerships | Tried it with and without them and automatically got the best price | 34000 for exl-res | Yes I know you can get a stripped down lx model a lot cheaper but it was worth every Penny | Was still to cheap to spend for touring model with navi I always have my tom tom gps to fall back on LOL | 
 "words": We have owned our Touring Pilot since May | We drove to Maine with 3 teenagers and Mom and Dad | The trip went great | We attached a carrier on the back and had more than enough room for a 2 week trip | This is a user friendly car | The seats fold down so easily-only 1 person needed | For the long trip I found the space above the glove box helpful for gum change etc | Our teens love the wireless headsets and the ability for us to hear XM while they watched their DVD | The road handling was excellent- especially in a horrible rain storm | The rear wiper starts out fast then goes into it's slow mode-very helpful | All in all -a very satisfied customer | As an ex-suburban owner- goodbye GM | 
 "words": After narrowing down the search to the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot we chose the Pilot for its cargo capacity and value proposition | A like equipped Highlander was several thousand dollars more | After a month with the new Pilot we are very satisfied | Comfortable ride good performance and improved gas mileage from the previous year | Honda quality is readily apparent everywhere in the vehicle | A great choice
 "words": I have been shopping for a new SUV for 6 months | Almost bought the Toyota 4Runner but decided on Honda Pilot because of 3rd row fold down seat | I love that it does not look like a crossover | The only negative is the 2nd row seats only recline a little | We are a family of 4 coming out of an Odyssey and we loved to be able to recline the 2nd row on long trips | I also like the door cup holders on our 07 CR-V and the 09 Pilot only has them for the 2nd row | There are 2 cup holders in the center console | I love the high tech luxurious feel of the cockpit | The drivers seat feels very cushy and I love the lumbar support | My kids love the pop out remote control for the DVD | Averaging 17mpg city | 
 "words": With a growing family we were in the market for a large crossover | Viewed all the typical competitors and the Honda was honestly last on our list | The deciding factor | We had one requirement that eliminated all of the other crossovers | We wanted to fit a rear facing infant seat another car seat and an adult in the second row | The Honda was the only car that did it safely and comfortable | We are amazed that so few cars can do that other than the GMC Yukon which is much too large for city driving | So far the ride is fine | Fit and finish leave much to be desired | Already have one panel that doesn't fit right but I hope Honda can fix it | 
 "words": We looked at every Mid-size SUV on the market and the 2009 Honda Pilot was at the bottom of our list | My husband test drove it first and said I should really check this car out and I am so glad I did | It is beautiful inside and out fun to drive easy to park great stereo kids love it and it has every bell and whistle you can think of | I am extremely pleased with the new Pilot | Who needs a mini van when there is an SUV like this on the market | 
 "words": For the most part this vehicle is awesome | Some people have had an issue with the exterior but I have had nothing but compliments on its looks | It's one tough truck for sure | The handling is excellent | Although it took some getting used to the transmission that slows you down when you take your foot off the accelerator | The turning radius is unbelievable | The only thing troubling me right now is the gas mileage | I went from a 4-runner with a V8 to the Pilot thinking I would get better mpg with a 6cyl | So far thats not the case | I primarily drive in stop and go traffic | I am only getting about 13 mpg | I do run the A C constantly so that may have something to do with it | Otherwise I love it | 
 "words": I purchased my pilot 3 weeks ago | It is so fun to drive and very comfortable | You can't beat a Honda | The turn radius is exceptional | Love the back up camera | 
 "words": I just traded in my 2003 Pilot with 90000 mile on it still going strong | I just wish the new pilot had similar if not same mileage per tank as old model | I was able to get close to 350 miles per tank which was smaller where as I only got 250 or less with new one bigger tank | I do notice the new one drives more like a truck with more power | I have to agree with one of the review about the sloppy finished interior under the driver seat has metal parts sticking out beyond the carpet | Overall I do love my new Pilot and my kids love the XM radio and navigation | Not crazy about the bells and whistle but nice to have for those who might appreciated it | I still am glad I got the car | 
 "words": The 2009 Honda Pilot is the best SUV I have every driven | I have owned the 2004 Pilot that was reliable spacious but unappealing | I have owned a Sequoia that was too big and a gas guzzler | I have also owned a Jeep Cherokee that dragged during take off had poor gas mileage and horrible interior | I have found the SUV that I will drive for a long time | Thanks Honda for the new design | I love it | love driving it | and because I like the vehicle so much I can almost better deal with going to the pump to pay for unnecessarily high priced gas | 
 "words": After 15 years of mini vans we finally have a ride I love to drive | We traded in our 06 Odyssey Touring | We test drove pretty much everything in this class with AWD and third row seating | We could not find another SUV in this price range that rode as nice with as much room | We also drove the 08 Pilot and there really was no comparison | The interior design improvements over the 08 probably sold us more than anything else | The additional room is what sold my wife plus the driving comfort | I never wanted to drive her mini vans but she has trouble keeping me out of | her | new Pilot | At 6 | 1 | I | m able to sit in the third row seat comfortably | After 500 miles we're very happy and impressed | 
 "words": WE have looked few other crossover SUVs AND have bought this | NOT a bad decision | 
 "words": After looking for the ideal SUV and trying the Acadia Enclave Highlander and the Outlook we end up with the '09 Pilot | And I am glad I did purchase this SUV | It rides great and it is so roomy inside | Other vehicles had better gas mileage and maybe a little more room in the trunk with 3rd row up but the leg room for 3rd row was not as good as the Pilot | Also Honda has a better money returned for the vehicle than others | After all my wife and I are very happy with this vehicle | 
 "words": I love everything about my new Honda Pilot | It is fun to drive and is a great car for families | It is very spacious inside including the third row | 
 "words": Maybe because this is the first year for this updated model but I noticed a lot of small fit and finish problems | Didn't expect this from Honda | 
 "words": Honda has hit a home run with this | Don | t bother with an Acura MDX save 10K and get the Honda Pilot with the same features | Ride is powerful and smooth handles like a luxury vehicle can carry a ton | Gets decent MPG for an SUV this size | We have the 4x4 and are averaging 18 driving in mostly mountain roads only 2 mpg less than our Honda Odyssey | Doubt you can improve MPG without decreasing the power maybe Honda can come up with a hybrid model someday like the Highlander | Couldn | t be happier though | We are military family of 4 and have many moves left in our career we need the space and ability to tow a trailer | Buy one | and enjoy | Great job again Honda |

 "words": had been SUV shopping for 3 months | I was so close to the Acadia | or the CX9 | but just didn't like the eggs-why do all the SUVs have the same shape | It cuts down on visibility and limits the access to cargo | I also wanted the window in the hatch to open individually | No other vehicle had this option | I had a minivan and really considered myself a SUV kinda girl | When I saw the new redesign for the Pilot I got excited and decided to wait until it came out before purchasing the other eggs | Drove it got it and love it love it love it | Handling is so responsive | Just driving it today and noticing how easy it is to maneuver | Much better than the van urrgh | and the other eggs |

 "words": Very Comfortable and spacious | Definitely the best SUV for a family because you can fit 3 people in both the middle and back rows | The reason we bought this vehicle is because we have two kids in car seats and my wife wanted to be able to sit in the back with them | This is the only SUV we could find that has the LATCH system in the middle seat | So we can put the two car seats together and my wife can sit on the end | The reason this is handy is so that if others needed to access the third row you wouldn't have to remove a car seat | That would be a pain | The third row seat is also actually quite spacious for adults | Great family car | The only thing is that it's kinda boring to drive |
