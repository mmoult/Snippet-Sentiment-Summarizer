REVIEWS
 "words": Forced to trade in my 99 Durango Cash4Clunkers after getting rear-ended and getting more damage than 'Ol Reliable was worth | After shopping ALL crossovers except for the Mazdas ran out of time and the dealers were running out of inventory I settled on V6 Saturn Vue FWD | 2000 miles into it I've found 1 It is very attractive on outside | 2 Very attractive on inside 3 Plenty of power in a small ride 3 Plenty of cargo and room for 5 | 4 Transmission timing seems rought in 2nd gear 5 Gas mileage is not that great | Around 20-22 MPG mix town hiway | 6 Remain convinced that I got the best deal on wheels at the time | All in for about 22600 after clunker and dealer cash | 
 "words": I bought my Vue after 4 months of researching SUV's | Having owned a 2001 Saturn SL1 I wanted to test drive the Vue | I'm sure glad I did | My wife swears by her Mazda Tribute but she quickly fell in love with the Vue | Fun to drive ample power | Driver cockpit instrument set up is great | Above all I love the looks | All my neighbors can't believe their eyes when they see its a saturn | Fuel economy could be better but nothing is ever perfect | Bravo Saturn | 
 "words": The Vue is fun to drive | I recently took it up mountains with three passengers | The V-6 with the manual mode shift made the drive easy work and fun | The car has excellent control to hug the curves and ample power to negotiate the inclines | The features including On-Star Directions and Connections and the satellite radio added to the driving pleasure | The fuel economy is still somewhat disappointing but the car is not yet broken in | I would not hesitate to recommend either the 4 cylinder or V-6 | Fred Saunders 
 "words": For price feel as though VUE offers fantastic value | Possesses numerous amenities which adds to quality of driving | 4 cylinder has lots of pep and enough power | Been getting 28 | 5 MPG mostly highway and still breaking in | Stability Track ABS efficient- did not skid out when I had to jam on brakes | Car very fun to drive great mover and does not feel light like a tin can | Feel safe when driving | Owned other crossovers tested competition and found VUE to offer most gadgets style value and performance | Very pleased so far w first Saturn | Must say great experience with dealership and they offer comp car washes and donuts | 
 "words": We shopped all over for a nice vehicle and we found the Saturn Vue V6 | The vehicle was maxed with factory options imaginable except factory Navigation | First of all I need to say the vehicle looks just fantastic and the ride is good | The auto was in the shop 6 times within the last year for torn seats side seat supports breaking twice loud noise coming from the engine and it was the A C clutch in the engine area | We also had the OnStar service 3 times because when we added more minutes to the phone OnStar deleted our service | Yipes | XM radio was also updated | We wanted to consolidate and trade in 2 vehicles to get a single one | OnStar does not refund XM Radio does not refund | 
 "words": I love the looks and amenities of my Vue | This is my second Saturn my first was a 2007 Vue Hybrid | But the AWD has 600 extra pounds and 70 more horsepower | It will make a big difference winters | The ride is very assuring plenty of power for passing and hills | The interior is very classy | And I really like the curves of the body shape | My one reservation is the seating | I am a large guy and the seats are uncomfortable after just a few minutes | The seat hinge and the hanger that the seat cushion support hangs off of cause a degee of discomfort | Perhaps as everything wears in that will abate | But the seat depth is to short I could use another inch or two | 
 "words": I bought this Vue last month and I am not happy with it at all | Within two weeks of getting it brand new the stabilitrak lights came on and needed to be serviced | They said it was a loose fuse | They supposedly fixed it | A week later it popped back on | Now they don't know what the problem is | I have to wait until it happens again and spend 2 more hours at the facility to get it fixed | The bluetooth is a pain | People are having problems hearing me and the clock disappears when I'm on it | But what's even worse is the cupholders | They are fixed in a way that they are so far down and blocked that you have to pull cups from the top and it spills your drinks | and two cups will not fit in there | 
 "words": Excellent exterior styling very much like a Lexus RX330 | Interior well laid out comfortable and quiet | Like the climate controls even though not dual-zone can set temperature | Lots of room | Mechanically the vehicle performs very well hybrid action almost unnoticeable | Only indication really is a sense of background braking as the energy recovery system kicks in on some deceleration though that is not objectionable in the least | Acceleration is very good especially for a 4-cyl | Sound system is excellent love the satellite radio | 
 "words": This is my third Saturn and first SUV | I test drove 10 or more SUV's and came back to trusty Saturn this is my third one | I love my dealer and drove over 70 miles to buy from them | I saw reports that the interior stains easily and I don't keep cars nice and I have no problems with the interior | My dealer gave me some of the stain fighter they use | The steering feels like a car very manueverable the seats are wide and comfy | I can fit alot of junk in it | Love the XM and free Onstar | All of my Saturns have had great maintenance records | Love Love Love my VUE | Join our Club if you want a great vehicle and super dealer staff | 
 "words": I traded in my Chevy Tahoe for a Saturn Vue | I wanted something smaller and more economical which I got | Overall I am satisfied with the vehicle but have some complaints | The windows and or sun roof cannot be opened without dealing with an excrutiating painful vacuum feeling on your head and ears | Feels like you are going to be sucked right out of the car | Steerling wheel needs to be tilted down further | Seats are very uncomfortable | Seats and carpets stain very easily | Dust dirt accumulate quickly on dash and in cup holders | No passenger unlock button for doors | Cup holders in an awkward position | 
 "words": I traded in my Lexus RX 330 about 2 weeks ago for the Vue Redline | While the quality of the interior materials cannot compare the Vue certainly did put the fun back in my commute | The Vue is sporty to drive quick response easy to maneuveru turns tight parking spots | The interior headroom is better than my RX but the front legroom is a little tight | Sales experience was good financing with incentives made it easy | Hopefully the quality holds up and I'll be driving my Vue for many years | 
 "words": I researched and evaluated lots of different vehicles before settling on the VUE | I was deciding in between a pre-owned Lexus or Mercedes when I saw a Red Line VUE drive close to my home | I couldn't believe it was a Saturn | It had the looks of an European vehicle | I went the next day and test drove a VUE and was hooked | Put this vehicle on the list | Plus with O APR for 60 months an easy choice | 
 "words": Nice looking outside OK inside | Seats stain very easily and are a bit narrow | The seat back cushion feels like a large lump for support | The electronic temp gauges taking a while to change from cold to hot vice versa | Lights in console and dial gauges a strange yellow color not pleasing to the eyes | Additionally the console gauges seem to be tipped upwards a bit so if you sit low and back they are not straight on | Plastic around ateering wheel column rubs when turning wheel | Not enough legroom up front | I am 5'10 and could not stretch out legs on long drive | 
 "words": I was ready to purchase an SUV looking for just the right fit | After testing out 3 other versions of the compact SUV's I found what I wanted | The 4 cyl has plenty of power and so far after 2 weeks the mileage is fine | Averaging 22 MPG even with a heavy foot | With this model and features I didn't have to settle I got what I wanted and enjoy the XM radio OnStar features | 
 "words": I fell in love when I drove my sister's 07' Vue and counted the days till I could get my own | The V6 has tons of power and it handles well | So far I'm getting about 18 | 6 miles per gallon and I'm happy with that | The XM radio is addicting and makes long drives nice | You can't go wrong with this SUV | 
 "words": My first look always the looks | First drive was | 1 solid vehicle 2 impressive power 3 I like it 4 how much is this | 5 looked at Mazda CX-7 no turbo for me 6 Honda | Looks cheap | walked away 7 Nissan Murano | nice but too expensive What a joy | I will stay American Made if they produce vehicles like this | 
 "words": My Vue has excellent performance and handling so feels like a sports luxury vehicle to me | The fit and finish is great and the interior is spacious for my family with two young boys | 
 "words": I've only driven my new '09 VUE XE enough to exhaust a single tank of gas but my satisfaction with this car warrants some serious praise | The upscale Euro styling both inside and out is simply unmatched within this price range | Fit finish and interior materials truly are class-leading | The ride is solid quiet and smooth | I choose the 2 | 4L based on both cost and fuel economy and don't regret the decision | While the 4 won't win you any races it's more than adequate for both city and freeway driving | I moved from a Chevy Trailblazer to the VUE and would trade the refinement of this ride over the TB's power any day | 
 "words": I have been a fan of Japanese cars because of the look and reliability | American cars always looked bulky and dated | Not this one | I had 2 Hondas and a Mitsubishi before | I was coming out of a Honda Pilot lease and wanted a smaller SUV | I was going to lease either a Nissan Rogue or a Subaru Forester | The Nissan dealer offered a special lease on the Rogue | On my way to sign the lease I decided to stop and see the new Vue and check out the GM incentives | The minute I checked out the Vue I fell in love with it | Loved the exterior and the interior | It looked very well made with no cheap material anywhere | First tank city driving car mileage with some AC use is 19 | 86 MPG | 
 "words": We bought our '05 Vue new four years ago and when it came time for a new car we wanted nothing else | Our old one had zero problems with it and had 78k on the odometer | We brought our new '09 Vue home and just love it | We couldn't be happier | The build quality is dramatically better as is the comfort and interior trims | The old one was good but this one is great | This is our third purchase from a Saturn dealer and the buying experience is always easy and hassle-free | Saturns have many nice options are included in the package price of the car | We don't have to add on much at all if anything | Will definitely purchase a Saturn again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new SUV
 "words": Although I'm a confirmed Honda guy I decided to test drive the 2009 Saturn Vue XR what a surprise | This car looks great and drives even better | It's solid as a rock with better steering response that the three BMWs I've owned | I needed a car that is flat towable behind our motor home so I compared Honda CR-V Ford Escape and the Saturn Vue | The Vue won out and I've been very pleased with it so far | 
 "words": I bought a Saturn Vue Hybrid recently | I only have about 1300 miles on it so far | I like the auto engine stop when the car stops | I like the quick re- start | It happens so smoothly that you hardly know it | I needed an SUV for camping and bad roads but didn't want the bad mileage of other SUVS | This car has done well no bad roads and also gets good mileage | 28 MPG on the first tank | 29 on the second tank including some back roads | 30 on the third tank | It is light at about 3800 pounds | Has a useable area behind the second row of seats | Has a bigger back seat than the Escape or many other small SUVs | Unlike many hybrids this does well on the freeway | Great car |
