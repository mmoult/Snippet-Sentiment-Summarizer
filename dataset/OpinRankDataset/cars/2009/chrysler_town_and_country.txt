 "words": This is a reliable and appealing car that I have had in my possession for over a year in which it has proven its worth | On the interior the features of the car such as the satellite radio make the long rides more enjoyable | The leather upholstery in the car gives it a comfortable feel and the layout in the car provides for communication between passengers without largely distracting the driver | Each of the two televisions mounted on the ceiling of the gray roof provide a distraction for kids but I have found that they block the driver | s view in the rearview mirror |

 "words": Our vehicle is a Touring with the 4 | 0 Liter | With incentives this vehicle is substantially less expensive than the Honda and Toyota competition that we choose to compare with | A similar Honda was over 5K more | Note to Toyota your stock tires supplied were horrible for winter driving | Do you not know where the vehicles are being delivered to hello | Handling is a little sloppy but since we use it for highway not such a big deal | Don't try to use this vehicle in the mountains | On our first try even though we used the shiftable auto transmission to slow the vehicle the rotors warped after one trip | The 4 | 0 liter motor is an improvement from our previous T C decent power and mpg |

 "words": We have had our van for one week now and just got back from a long road trip | After trading in a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan we had an idea of what to expect from a new Chryler but we were pleasantly surprised | The new van has vastly improved entertainment options and interior quality | My boys have had a lot of fun rotating the 2nd row seats to face backwards and challenge their brothers to video games on the third row video screen | Meanwhile I have enjoyed listening to Sirius sattelite radio in the front without having to listen to the sounds of race cars and explosions from the rear | We had 138000 miles on our last van | We were very happy about the unlimited powertrain warrany | Good | 
 "words": I just got back from a 2000 mile road trip and had no issues at all with my TC | I used to own a 2005 and the quality has been great with both | By far the best vans on the road today | The 4 | 0 engine is the best that I have had since my single days | 
 "words": I sold my 2001 4WD4D Ram two weeks before taking delivery of my 2009 T C | What a change | The first thing you notice is the ride and great gas mileage | I ordered the 4 | 0 with trailer-tow | Nice strong pull with no lag or stutter | Brakes are light with the right amount of feedback | This 25th Anniversary comes with 17 inch wheels and tires which is a great plus | The first trip to the East Coast was pleasant and had no issues | With 636 miles showing i was getting 23 | 5 mpg | There is just something about a Ram Truck going the road | 
 "words": This is my second TC in 10 years | I love these cars | I never had any troubles with the TC 2000 | It was time to change and I just did the same and got another TC | The touring is exceptionally luxurious and comes with lots of options | Fun to drive accelerates well and very comfortable | 
 "words": I drove Chrysler for 15 yrs | I love them but in the 09 tc the driver seat is too close to the front | It don't go back enough | when it goes back it also go down | then you can't see over the dashboard | The front part of the seat is always higher then your rear- you feel like your sitting in a bucket | If your under 5ft9in I think you will have problems with the driver's seat | 
 "words": Just an update from my initial review back in April | The vehicle has perform wonderfully we have had no issues with fit trim or initial build quality | Mileage has improved since it has been broken in Highway 55-60 MPH around 25 mpg Highway 65-70 mph around 23-24 mpg | City Hwy around 18- 19 mpg | I read the reviews from car magazines of this minivan prior to buying you'd thought this vehicle to be a dog not so very comfortable dependable quite | Our last TC got us 136000 miles w o any work other than routine maintenance | I expect the same here | 
 "words": This is my second TC | Obviously I like them | My first one was purchased in 2000 | My friends with Honda Toyota or Nissan with equal minivan age had to do one or more major repairs during the past 9 years | We never had any trouble with it and it has 100000 miles | It was time to get a new one | After shopping around we decided to stay with Chrysler | The 2009 touring is impressive in all aspects | 
 "words": This auto satisfied everything we were looking for in every category | The comforts the cargo ability the gadgets styling price and even its ability to maneuver in tight areas | It has truly made our life more streamlined and functional with having 2 children | not to mention the interior styling is as luxurious as it is functional | The exterior is more bold with strong modern lines | The previous models were way to soft for me especially the front and rear fascias | There is nothing weak or meek with this much more handsome model | The interior was truly more luxurious than the Odyssey Quest Traverse Acadia F150 1500 and a host of other SUV's trucks mini's we considered | 
 "words": I drive the TC for a hotel | It's rented longterm from Enterprise | It replaced a 2008 Dodge GC essentially the same vehicle | Overall pleasure to drive | Handles well almost what you'd call 'sporty' | Well-appointed tightly assembled nicely functional | Comfortable though passenger space is compromised in the Stow Go version a center bench would accomodate one more adult | The trans needs refinement domestication | See below | 
 "words": Very commanding view of the road most versatile minivan w all 3 rows folding flat closest thing to a hot rod van | 
 "words": I just recently traded my 2002 TC for a new '09 Touring edition | I first test drove a used Mercedes E-class because we already own a Mercedes SUV which my husband loves and of course was pleased with the ride but when I asked the question whether our six member family was ready to have my husband's SUV be the largest vehicle in our household answer came back a resounding NO | Because have had such great experience with two previous TC's trade-in had 130000 miles decided to check out new TC and dealer incentives | By the time all the incentives were added including 3500 for trade-in my 37000 minivan went down to 28000 and well | the rest is history in the making | 
 "words": We have owned our minivan a year and a half and the check engine light has been on since 48hrs after we bought it | We have been to 3 different dealerships and nobody can fit it | My car juts forward and engine revs into the red as I am driving at least once a week | I have been told it is a new model and they are working on the kinks | I was also told it has a life time warranty so why should I worry | I told them if my car blows up on the highway a warranty is not going to save my life or the car behind me hitting me when I jut | I can't wait for my lease to be up in another year and a half so they can have this lemon back | I will never buy a MiniVan again and never any Chrysler again | 
 "words": I have had the van for 6 weeks | I love the minivan and it is very comfortable for 6 adults | Rides well and so far everything works well | Bought the extended warranty after reading Edmounds review | 16 inch wheels is easier for getting in and out of van | Averaging about 17 miles gallon in first 1000 miles using 89 Octane recommended for 4 | 0 | Mostly mixed driving Suburbs | Good Engine layout everything is easy to check | 
 "words": Our family has just accepted our new van and we love it | The kids love the fact that their windows now go down and that they can listen to Kids Stuff from Sirius satellite radio and watch a DVD at the same time | In fact we can listen to three unique audio visual sources simultaneously | For any parent who has had to listen to Dora while driving you know how important that is | We are leaving this week for a 1000 mile drive to Gulf Shores | I expect this to be an enjoyable drive with our new Inferno Red Town Country | 
 "words": The Chrysler has been an enjoyment to own the vehicle handles great on the road as well as handling a growing family | The features like stow and go make the vehicle very functional for us | The automatic doors are a must for loading and unloading children | Very happy so far and hope to own this van for years to come | 
 "words": We thought after our last minivan we would not buy another but after test driving of '09 Accord sedan we concluded that they are too low with no ride comfort advantage over the TC | The crossover vehicles although more stylish do not offer the verstility of a minivan and get worse gas mileage with harsher ride | The Touring trim level was just right for us we have no need for DVD players leather etc | 
 "words": I have had the Town and Counrty for a little over a week | I have to say that I really enjoy driving it | The seats are really comfy and my daughter loves the DVD player | My husband seems to really like the satelite radio that comes free for a year and we all love the rear view back up camera | The radio is very fancy with the ability to store songs on the internal hard drive | My screen saver is a picture of the family in Disney world | The doors are easy to open and close and the radio is easily viewed while driving and easy to navigate | I know I have not had the car for too long but our experience so far has been nothing but positive | The car is quiet love the stow and go seats | 
 "words": My wife and I just purchased our 1st minivan at age 62 | I love all aspects of the Town Country | The driving force in our purchase was the stow and go seating | With the seats stowed we can place an air mattress in the rear and let my wife with back problems rest | We have found no problems not one so far | We are looking forward to many retirement trips in this mini van | 
 "words": We came out of a Toyota Sienna that had alot of engine problems | The Chrysler has had none of the drawbacks and bad dealer support that Toyota is famous for | We love the Sto and Go seats | Toyota nmade you drag the seats out | Better quality and quieter than Toyota
 "words": We looked at Honda's and TC's and for the money you just can't beat a TC | I went from a Maxima so it's a bit of an adjustment but so far I love it | I did however upgrade to the 4 | 0L and think it's probably worth it | 
 "words": This is a great van good power great layout and tons of entertainment options | I agree that there are parts of the car where better quality build materials would be better but I paid 35000 after the rebates and employee pricing | The Honda or Toyota would be 43000 for the same car | 
 "words": I have been driving Hondas but were tired of reliability problems | The transmission went out on my Odyssey | I love this new Town and Country | Quality much better than the Hondas I have had | 
 "words": Traded in a 1 year old Honda Odyssey due to the fact the transmission failed on it | I didn't want to deal with that for the next four or five years | This is my first Chrysler | It's as good as everyone says they are | Stow and Go seats are wonderful | Honda had you drag out the rear seats and boy were they heavy | I can't think of anything better | I love it | 
 "words": We have a limited model with all the options and have had no problems | It is the only true mini van still in the market and as such fills the segment perfectly | It is the first Chrysler we have ever owned and I am very impressed | We have owned one Ford and four GM mini vans and this is by far the best and most thought out product of the group | I sure would like to know what products the editor was comparing this with to give this vehicle a do not buy rating |
