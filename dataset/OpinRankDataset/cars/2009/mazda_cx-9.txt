REVIEWS
 "words": After 5500 miles the CX-9 is proving to be an excellent family vehicle | Even the third row seats are suitable for short trips | For a 7 passenger SUV the acceleration and handling are outstanding | The interior design is up to that Acura and Audi standard | I test drove the Acura MDX Honda Pilot Toyota Highlander | All of them are nice but the combination of price design size and performance made the Mazda a clear choice for my family of 5 | Bottom line I enjoy driving it and my wife appreciates the design and space for shuttling children | 
 "words": Best 3-row SUV out there | Drove Mercedes Lexus Cadillac Audi and Volvo none compared on interior quality and exterior style to the CX- 9 | Top that off with a price which was minimally 10K less than anything else and you have a real winner | GT package does shift the ride quality to the firm side but the handling achieved more than compensates | Car has every bell and whistle found on the high priced badges with better styling interior and exterior than any of them | Dealership experience has been excellent | 
 "words": We traded a xc90 awd as we needed more room in the back seats | Would have never thought about the Mazda cx9 beyond reading the reviews | Once my wife and I drove it we loved it | Cool looking mommy wagon without the geekness of a minivan or suv | Very fast handles well and looks way cool | 
 "words": Let me start by saying we never expected to like this vehicle so much | It was more of a let's take a look so we can eliminate one more option | But when you get behind the wheel and give this SUV a good look trust me if you buy another SUV I will be shocked | It is as close to perfect as you will find | It is simply THE best kept secret in the mid-size SUV Crossover market | Great size not to big not too small | Usable third row with as much legroom as many full size SUV | Great build quality | Smart engineering and logical design layout | Drives as much like a sports car as possible in an SUV | All the safety features | Unbelievable upscale features on the Grand Touring for the money | 
 "words": As a replacement for our minivan Nissan Quest the CX-9 is nearly as versatile just as comfortable and much more fun to drive | The acceleration is excellent the ride is smooth and the handling makes it feel much smaller than it actually is | We've been on some 5 hour road trips with no complaints from our 2 teens in back | We've also filled the 3rd row with teen-aged friends with no complaints on in-town trips | The front seating area could use some more storage space and the mpg is merely adequate but overall this is an excellent choice for those who need a versatile carrier | 
 "words": Picked up the Touring AWD on 9 15 09 | All I can say is that Mazda has the gem of 2009 here | Forget Toyota and Ford test drive the CX-9 and you will be in for a shock | There are items that come standard in this puppy that you would have to get as options on anything else | With the dealer incentives 4k you are driving away with a vehicle that would cost 40 large anywhere else | Factor in the end of Model year and dealerships trying to get rid of inventory | there is just a ton of value here | Our 3 kids love this vehicle for the space and the wife adores it because it literally drives like a car | Before you buy anything else | Test drive the Mazda CX-9
 "words": Its hard to believe this is an SUV | It handles superbly and feels solid as a rock | I'm comfortable knowing my wife and kids use this full time | Much better than the competition for handling ride at this price level | Surprisingly smooth and comfortable but could still use some improvements comfort wise | A superb value though all things considered | Hopefully reliability will be better than predicted and compare better with Toyota and others | 
 "words": Drove home in intense storm but CX-9 took it all in stride while other cars pulled to the side | Seats are outstanding for long hauls | Able to have normal conversations at freeway speeds | Car never feels tippy despite having 8 inches of ground clearance | At 200 inches it is a long vehicle but doesn't feel that way | Bose stereo is weak on highs but midrange sounds good when connected to an ipod | Feels german in driving experience | 
 "words": I was looking to replace a 2004 MDX | The newer MDX while very impressive is mid 50s with all options | Ouch | The dash of the new MDX has way too much going on | The CX9 was a surprise for sure | For what you get this is by far the best in the larger 3rd row SUVs | Many people actually see this rig and think it is a Lexus | You don't see as many of the cx9s on the road and I cannot figure out why | We have three small children and did not want to go mini-van | 
 "words": Love the cx9 | We test drove several cars until we decided to purchase a cx9 | We need the room of a minivan but wanted something to please our teenage children | They also love it | It drives like a car similar to mazda6 | It is a large roomy suv but feels smaller than it is | We love using it for our children sport events easy to bring cooler and gear for needed for games | The sport version of the CX9 is a great value you get many standard features for your money | 
 "words": As the reviews said CX-9 is a cool design great drive and excellent value for money | Drives like a car is a very roomy people carrier with sporty looks | Am getting about 20 21 mpg during the first month | 
 "words": We have owned a Lexus LX470 and Toyota Products for years and were quite impressed with quality and character of new Mazda's | Mazda has made the CX-9 both comfortable and fun to drive | The only flaw I see is the lack of AWD all the time and using a sport tire ie will last at most 30k miles if lucky vs a more all weather tire with a longer life | 
 "words": When compared with its rivals and their sticker prices the CX-9 is in tough company | However when you look at what you'll actually pay for them the CX-9 looks much better | It appears to be the value leader very nicely appointed sports-car zoom-zoom handling which you won't find in the competitors and feature laden | Even my skinny 7 year old can slide the center seats to access the rear she couldn't do that in the Tahoe we had | Speaking of the Tahoe when we compared them side-by-side the CX-9 has more depth behind the rear seats and has more depth when the rear seats are folded | I wouldn't have believed that if I hadn't seen it myself | 
 "words": I was hit broadside T-boned on the passenger side at an intersection | Lady ran a red light and hit me | I must say I am thankful I bought the CX- 9 | The side curtain airbag deployed instantly no white powder clean the doors and structure took the impact and protected me I was completely unhurt | While both front and rear doors were completely crushed the doors did not bend into the inside the side windows did not break | As a matter of fact the doors STILL opened and closed | Mazda has built an extremely safe and exceptional vehicle | The CX-9 was repaired two new doorsand is back on the road as good as new | Feel free to read my previous review dated 1 13 09 | Thanks Mazda life saver | 
 "words": We did a lot of looking around and test driving | We liked the Ford Flex Buick Enclave and GMC Acadia but the Mazda CX-9 was just a better deal all around | We were able to get more options for the price than we could have with the others | It has a sporty body style and the 20 rims just sweeten the deal | The 2nd row can adjust so you can move the seats up to make extra room for the 3rd row | The 2nd row seats also partially recline which is a favorite feature for my kids | This car is definitely fun to drive | It's smooth | Even with 20 wheels it's still a smooth and comfortable ride | If looking at the CX-9 definitely check out the Grand Touring the options are great | 
 "words": We wanted a road car to replace three previous Buick Ultras | We drove GMC Chevrolet Saturn and Hyundai SUV's | The wife did not want a 'bus' feel and when we drove the CX-9 it hit the mark for size and comfort | We have over 11000 miles in ice snow and 100-degree heat and lots of night driving | The Xenon headlights are a true plus | The 20-inch wheels give the vehicle the stance and driving feel that we really enjoy | We have commented several times how much we love our '9' and do not miss our three big Buicks | One minor recall for power seat cable placement other than that she goes | 
 "words": Basically a acura mdx for someone on a budget like me get some great features and utility worthy of luxury- level vehicles for an affordable price | Fuel economy is the big downside but no vehicle in this class is any more impressive | I can honestly say this large cuv is pretty fun to drive | Easily comparable to my 05 murano even though it's bigger | 
 "words": I test drove many and this car was the clear value leader IF you can still get the generous discounts | Safety was a high-priority and the CX-9 has every safety device feature available on vehicles under 50000 except Daytime Running Lights | Excellent handling steering | Design and features impress everyone from teens to middle-aged | To be sure it rides a little rough on typical streets you will feel all the bumps but has the most comfortable car seats I've ever sat in and I don't have leather | Maybe the best thing is that it's a big car but doesn't look or drive like one | No car is perfect but the minor annoyances on this one are more than made up by the outstanding ones | 
 "words": Normally we travel on long trips in our Grand Caravan but on this trip from Detroit to Mackinac over Memorial Day we drove the CX-9 | My teenage daughter that seems to complain about everything these days had nothing but praise for the CX-9 | So did the other kids | Despite being smaller it really felt like there was more interior room | I couldn't believe all the luggage and the people I was able to haul comfortably | Much more fun to drive than the mini-van too | 
 "words": So far so good but it has only been a month | I'm so glad that I didn't get the Highlander | The Madza is more agile and less truck like to me | So far no buyers remorse just hoping the reliability factor is as good as Toyota and Honda | 
 "words": I drove a 2007 Hummer H3 for about a year before I decided to look at some other options | I can't believe I wasted a year of car payments on the Hummer | After driving the Grand Touring model I was sold | The ride is superb and the features are great | I thought I would miss the Hummer but I was wrong | 
 "words": Nice ride | Comparable to other luxury SUVs without paying the | Nice handling and power | Touring edition has some nice features that cost more in other models | Definitely better than highlander or the pilot | Lots of room great bose surround system | Comfy ride | 
 "words": It was between the 09 Honda pilot and the cx9 and for the price the cx9 won out | I would have spent over 40k to get the features in the cx9 | It is really fun to drive smooth comfortable and quiet | Brakes really Nice and after 4 months without it being cleaned I have very minimal brake dust | Haven't had any problems so far | I had a durango before the cx9 so it does sit quite a bit lower | 
 "words": I got a great deal on fully loaded GT | Was looking to buy a Toyota Highlander being I'm already a Toyota customer but then I drove the CX-9 AND WOW | it is much better and offers a lot more bang for the buck | 
 "words": I love this car | I live in my car for work with a typical drive of over 10 hours a week and this car is made for me | The radio features allow easy reception anywhere the seat is very comfortable and the Bluetooth will end up saving my life | And so very very fun to drive | Researched to death and came down to this or the Highlander | One look and I was in love | 
 "words": got a good deal on FWD SP | very quiet and convincing ride | sense of safety in a large car but still nimble to maneuver | I was looking between Honda Pilot and this car wins in every aspects | hopefully it turns out to be reliable as well | 
 "words": We have an 11 month old baby and another one on the way so decided to trade in the Saab 9-3 sportwagon and look for something larger | Minivans were out of the question so we looked at the crossover segment and settled on the CX-9 GT AWD | We chose it primarily for it's space handling and exterior style | So far we have not been disappointed | It's comfortable easily stores the family and our gear and is actually fun to drive | It's also a stylish looking vehicle and way more interesting than a minivan | 
 "words": Our search came down to a used 2008 Ford Edge or a new 2009 Mazda CX-9 | The Mazda won out because of the favorable lease terms that were being offered | The car is fun to drive and the engine has plenty of zip | The transmission is silky smooth | Drives like a smaller car even with third row capacity | Ride is on the stiff side | Engine is quiet | Form and fit are good | no rattles | 3rd row offers nice space but seems to do so at the expense of the 2nd row | The width of the driver's compartment is cramped | Not the easiest car to get in and out of watch your head vs | frame | Console storage not good considering space it takes up | Gawky radio nobs on dash | Nice car although I'm not wowed by it |

 "words": The CX-9 is good looking and fairly responsive for a heavy vehicle | But the engine developed a ticking noise at 12k miles | NOT what I would expect from a 40k car | Been in twice to fix but has returned twice | Dealer service is OK not on par with Acura BMW Lexus | 
 "words": We are expecting our second child and our Mazda tribute is now too small when carrying people around we had to drive two cars | So we started looking for a 7 passenger vehicle the choices were between the Pilot Highlander Traverse and the CX-9 | The Pilot and the Traverse had finishing touches that seemed cheap the Highlander exterior design seems as it did not know if it wanted to be a truck or a car so it chose something in between | At the end we got the CX-9 because we qualified for the 0 APR and no money down | Hey why pay cash when the bank is giving you money for free | So far no buying remorse | 
 "words": We've had the CX-9 for 10 months after reading favorable reviews on Edmunds | com | I have to say that the reviews were spot on as this has been the most fun to drive vehicle we have owned in the last 10 years | Handling excellent and everything remains tight and well engineered | Well done Edmunds for making such an accurate recommendation | 
 "words": After several months of looking at all SUVs and X-overs I selected the CX-9 | Am I glad I did the build quality workmanship features value fuel economy first 240 miles city with 62 miles freeway got 18 | 5 MPG | fun to drive and performance all add up to a best in class up and down the price scale | Much better than all contenders | This is a little known gem that will have a very bright future as soon as folks get to know and see them on the road | Outstanding lines sports car handling family friendly equally at home in a tux or Levis | This is a rare find in a market cluttered with me too and ordinary offerings | A must drive if you are in the market no disappointments here |

 "words": Just purchased so it's only been one week | So far we love it extremely fun to drive and a head-turner in the neighborhood | I recommend everyone try this if you are in the market for a large crossover |
