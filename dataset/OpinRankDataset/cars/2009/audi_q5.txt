REVIEWS
 "words": Was driving an S-line A6 for past 2 years and while it was great it was too big for me | The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV | I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5 | That's what made the difference | The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute' | One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip | My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool | 
 "words": Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it I have a default transmission and am not the only one they have no right answers as how to fix it they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles | That to me as a customer is unacceptable | 
 "words": My wife in on her second Audi first an A4 now an A6 | I'm the designated SUV driver in the family | I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano which performed well and was a good value but I've always been jealous of my wife's Audis | I looked at several mid-sized SUV's as a replacement but none compared with the Q5 | It drives like a sport sedan with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV | The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces but it feels very large inside | 
 "words": This car looks and handles great | It is fun to drive has plenty of cargo space and has a great sound system | I came from a Mercedes with every bell and whistle imaginable and with this car don't miss it | I agree that the side mirrors are too big and take getting used to | I do also agree the the shifting of the gears when breaking can be a little jerky- I may just need to get used to it | 
 "words": I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125000 miles | I love this new car | It drives like a dream a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV | The interior is simply elegant I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels | My closest choice was the Volvo XC60 which is also a great car but the MMI system on the Audi is just well cool | The volvo's nav feels very old school and clunky | My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog's feet could get caught in | Also the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain | 
 "words": My 2009 Prestige Q5 rides like a sport sedan | Great acceleration especially in sport mode and responsive steering | I was really surprised on my first all highway trip approx 75 miles when I averaged 29 | 1 mpg | The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets | Great access to rear storage due to low entry | Seats fold easily | Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome | The GPS leaves a lot to be desired | The point of interest's do not let you choose ANY retail stores | Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot Staples Target or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING | The restaurant search is a basic listing- can't choose cuisine- Italian Japanese etc | My 200 Garmin GPS is far superior | 
 "words": This is my sixth Audi and the second SUV | Although I love the Q7 I didn't need one that big | I traded it in for the new Q5 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it | Audis are very strong and safe cars to drive | they handle the roads so well | especially in these New England winters | There is a sense of security when driving them that I have not felt with other brands | 
 "words": Previous car was a Subaru 08 STI 5 dr hatch | Speed agility utilitarian use best describes our needs | STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads | So what was out there that would be fun to drive quick acceleration a great solid ride not too fancy in appearance and interior yet functional | My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions this is how I came across the q5 | In traffic great visibility amazing control maneuvering slow pokes | Quiet | An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build | Great turning into parking spaces | The vehicle drives and feels small | We bought the premium model base with some options which kept the price down | 
 "words": I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years | I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible | I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage | The Q5 fits the bill | The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room | It handles great and I | ve been getting 25 MPG at 75 MPH | The cabin is quiet the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good | This car provides great car performance with the functionality functions you use 99 of the time of a SUV | This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUV | s on the market and I can see why | 
 "words": Test drove many SUV crossovers in this segment including X3 and RX350 | Hands down Audi Q5 won | I have owned it now for three 3 weeks -and- the car is simply perfection in all aspects from comfort to performance | 
 "words": Do not buy the MMI Navigation Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle | You have two choices when starting your car | 1 The display comes on and the radio media begins playing | OR 2 The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio media is off | Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio media to come back on | You cannot start the car with the display and audio off | This is extremely annoying | I contacted Audi customer care | The representative verified this operation | I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it | There is no software firmware update available to address this problem | 
 "words": Amazing ride quality and craftsmanship | Drove the X3 and XC60 and the q5 beats them hands down in all areas | Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car | My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus | Bang and Olufsen in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus | Heated seats are standard but currently there isn't an option for Cool ventilated seats | They get really hot in the summer | For a 40 thousand dollar car one would expect more standard options | If there was a option to score on Value i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs Lexus Acura | 
 "words": Took delivery of new Q-5 with Premium Prestige Packages and immediately set out on 1200 mile trip | Vehicle performed almost flawlessly | The GPS stopped functioning necessitating the rebooting of the MMI | Q-5 held the road well at speeds to 80mph | Gas mileage averaged a whopping 25mpg | Interior is well appointed | Everything about the Q-5 is solid | The BO stereo is without equal | This is a great vehicle | 
 "words": I really love this car | I like the handling and the acceleration | There are a ton of features for the price | The only complaints I have are the gas mileage is kind of poor and the leather seats are kind of hard and don't really hold you in them very well | The Navigation screen would also be better in a touch screen | 
 "words": This is my first Audi and my first cross-over vehicle and I am thoroughly impressed with this car | Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi | Very good power for a V6 handles well and has a very smooth ride | Great interior good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic | I've owned 2 Acuras a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes which I'll never buy again and this car meets and or exceeds those | Better value for the than the comparable X3 or X5 or Lexus or Mercedes | Better features than the Acura RDX | Really happy with the purchase and I highly recommend the Q5 for anyone looking in this class of cars | 
 "words": I just bought 2 days ago | Engine is smooth on acceleration | A family of 4 can comfortably seat | I am having a blast | I love it | 
 "words": With Audi drive select you can change its driving properties quite nicely | With the ADS and the S Line tires and wheels Michelin Latitude Sport | It will stick with the best of them | Comfort setting for potholes works well | Prestige package is worth it | Pricey but a very nice ride | 
 "words": Okay this is my first review on a car | I have previously owned 3 Lexus BMW Acura and Toyota's | This is my first Audi had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed so almost did not even look at the Q5 | Glad I did this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED | Upside engine is great street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009 | Interior is extremely nice I have nearly all the options so car price tag is 50k which is appears overpriced at first but when comparing quality interior and options is right on the money | 
 "words": Car has a serious issue with the gearbox | In start stop traffic the gear is either too low or too high | Unable to shift correctly | Jerky harsh ride in town driving | Fuel economy is much poorer than the stated | 
 "words": The lease for my MB ML320 ended so I did some shopping around | I've tried Acura RDX and MDX and I had serious concern on passenger safety and lack of visibility | The same experience I had with Infiniti | MB GLK is really repulsive in design and BMW is still in the works to replace the outdated X3 | Q5 was the best choice that I could have made | The design is outstanding craftsmanship on the same level | Nice gadgets and the rooftop made my life so easy in convincing my wife a 10 out of 10 | 
 "words": This car is such a big upgrade from our 2006 X3 which we loved I can only begin to describe it | Comfortable huge acceleration great steering excellent visibility | Perfect car for our little family driving around the city | Plenty of room for car seats strollers groceries etc | and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town | Little nits side mirrors are too big auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste | But I love driving this car | Best car we've owned | By far | Including my BMW 328 blasphemy | Compared the Volvo XC60 Mazda CX-9 BMW X5 Acura MDX Lexus RX350 this was a no brainer | 
 "words": Excellent all-around luxury SUV | Traded in our 2004 Volvo XC 90 transmission problems | Looked at the Volvo XC60 and Lexus RX 350 among several others | After the dealer let us take the demo for a weekend we were sold | The ride is far more superior and has many luxury features in a very attractive package inside and out | This car is just plain fun to drive and exudes quality | We are getting about 21 mpg overall majority city driving | 
 "words": Owned 2 Mercedes and it was time for a change | We looked at everything in this segment | The choice was easy the Q5 won the battle hands down | Only had the car a couple days and love it | Got the premium plus package in meteor gray pearl | This car is completely amazing | This SUV drives like a car and sticks to the road better than the CLK we just turned in | If you are looking for a small SUV look no further you won't be disappointed | 
 "words": Premium Plus w nav in Ibis White I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5 | It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive | Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode and Triptronic is where the fun is | 0-60 in FAST | MMI is solid cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around gas mileage seems to be above listed visibility is very good steering responsive but not overly sensitive braking is predictable road noise is low even on 19s and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one | 
 "words": I've had more fun driving this car than any car I have owned and I've had several sports cars | Put the transmission in S and punch it and it throws you back in the seat | We test drove the Volvo Lexus and MDX | This car was far superior | It was the only one that said Buy me | Everything about it screams quality and luxury | We have been averaging about 19 mpg | I'm sure it would be higher if I could keep my foot out of it | It's just a super fun car to drive | We have the Prestige model definitely worth the upgrade | 
 "words": I LOVE my new Audi Q5 | Traded in a LandRover which was a major expensive headache | I have made a great choice | what a head turner | I strongly recommend the Q5 it is wonderful all the way around | I am so pleased with my vehicle | 
 "words": Just bought a Q5 Premium Plus with Navigation | Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want | But Audi is now offering 2 | 9 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments so net net it is like 0 financing 500 discount | The car is perfect for my wife | The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK | Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors | My only complaint is the relatively small interior space especially when compared to RX350 | Otherwise it was perfect | 
 "words": My brother needed a new vehicle for work | He asked me for help | We researched and test drove all the competition | The Q5 was the clear winner | My local dealership had a hail storm and he was able to get his Q5 repaired and looking new for 8000 off the selling price not MSRP | At such a deal I bought one also | His is black with tan interior and mine is white with tan interior | We both got the premium plus but he also got the MMI package | No need for bigger rims or S- line for us | In two weeks he put 1500 miles on his Q5 and could not be happier | 
 "words": Compared this car with other models and brands | Clearly ahead of the competition | Styling interior room sporty handling and more than enough power | Fuel economy as advertised | Loaded with technology | Was about to purchase an X5 | After driving the Q5 and comparing space feel and price the Q won hands down | Great car | 
 "words": We bought this car in April of 09 for my wife and I am ready to take it from her | The car is super fun to drive and especially so in the Sport mode | Has more get up and go than I ever expected | The transmission in the regular Drive mode can be a bit sluggish but works fine | There is plenty of room in the car I am 6 foot tall and the person behind me still has an adequate amount of room | Only had the car for a month now but I am already a big Audi fan | 
 "words": I've had the car two months and couldn't be more satisfied | I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 still love that car but the Q5 is more luxurious more comfortable smoother better gas mileage and just as fun to drive | I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed | I am getting 23 28 vs | the Audi claim of 18 23 | The better mileage the larger fuel tank less stops at the pump a happy driver | The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car | Thru traffic Manhattan streets suburban highways and local driving it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive | And my passengers have no complaints either | Thanks Audi |

 "words": We've driven the Q5 with Premium Plus for a month and we absolutely love it | It's small enough for urban driving parking but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced | Smooth linear acceleration balanced steering and grips the road like a sports car | Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads | MPG is around 17 so far vs | avg | of 13 with the X3 which is better than expected considering almost 100 city driving | My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge | This is great for side visibility but limits front visibility a bit when making turns for example | I think we'll get used to it |

 "words": My wife and I traded our S5 in on the Q5 and honestly the quality and build is the same | We've owned the Acura RDX and Toyota's Higlander in the past this vehicle is by far superior | We have owned BMW's before and looked at the X3 we are glad we waited | This vehicle gives us some of the performance we enjoyed in the S5 without all of the attention we got in the S5we get some but not as much | It also gives us the comfort of the S5 with greater cargo space | You forget you're riding in a SUV | We've only had it a couple of weeks we'll stick with Audi | I miss the BO |
