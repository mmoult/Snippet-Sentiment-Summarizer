REVIEWS
 "words": my brake pads and rotors went at 16500 miles | Both front rotors were warped causing me to need replacement | the dealer told me that there was nothing that they could do because the warranty was 12 12 on brakes | i called HQ and they said that until there is a recall I would have to pay for the repairs and that there was nothing that they could do for me | I was told by one of their mechanics that they are using inferior brake components to keep production costs down | If a recall comes out then I could get re- embursed for the brake job at that time | I am not going to buy out the lease now | They are getting this piece of crap back and going foreign | DON'T BUY THIS VEHICLE | 
 "words": Overall we have really loved our journey | We purchased when they first came out and the first issues I had were the heat radio windows not working at random intervals I would have to turn the car off and restart several times The dealership couldn't find any problems with it | I also hear a weird noise when I make hard left turns and my dash vibrates when I go over 50 mph | The latest thing that makes me regret the purchase is that the front brakes pads rotors are completely shot and it only has 21k miles on it | 
 "words": This car has been nothing but a headache since a month after we purchased it | It had an axel seal to bust causing oil to leak on the exhaust the transmission is always shifting gears sometimes it wont shift down when going up hills then when it does shift down it wont shift back up it down shifts to low gear while in cruise control going 70 mph on the interstate almost got us hitChrysler says that's the way the car is designed to work power steering whins all the time Chrysler says that is normal also | Any problem that this car has Chrysler says it is normal so it doesn't do any good to call them with your problems | All i can say is LEMON this car should have been YELLOW | 
 "words": Probably one of the quietest cars in it's class | Stunning with the 19 in chrome wheels | More storage than I could ever use | I love the green LED floor board lights handy if you drop something | A fun car to drive | love that Auto Stick | I'm used to rowing my own gears | Cool the way the middle seats pop up and forward out of the way | The wide opening door are great getting grandma in and out but you must watch the kids opening them to far in tight parking lots | Overall I love this car | Waiting for the Chrysler version |

 "words": I have had this vehicle for three months now and have had it on two long roadtrips | I get better gas mileage then posted | It is well built and very reliable | I have tried the safety features with almost getting in accidents while driving through Montreal Quebec of which were not my fault | I have owned 4 Chrysler Vehicles and have had no problems with any of them | If people would slow down and actually do the posted speed limit then maybe they would see better gas mileage | Everybody thinks that driving is a right WELL IT'S NOT | Keep up the good work Dodge |

 "words": I researched the Journey for 2 months it took me a few dealerships and a few weeks to finally get what I wanted | I have not had any major problems with the Journey as of yet I do hear a weird sound when turning left but I have not addressed it yet with the dealership | I would like for the Low Fuel signal to tell me how many miles left till empty | I average about 18 mpg w i city and have not taken a road trip as of yet | I enjoy the flex seating the space is a bit cramped but then again only my children will be sitting back there if needed |

 "words": It drives really well even though we took it in because the transmission can't always make up its mind what gear to be in on a slight upgrade | So far major disappointment with the gas mileageonly getting about 25 MPG on the highway not the 35 MPG its supposed to get | We asked about it at the dealership and were told the vehicle isn't broken in until its got 15000 kilometers which seems like an awful long time to brake in an engine | We got the journey because of its rated good gas mileage so we are keeping our fingers crossed hoping it will improve in the next few months | After reading some of the other reviews we consider ourselves lucky | 
 "words": Bought my Journey over a month ago | Love the way it looks love the way it drives | got it in green | Everything works good except for that strange noise that occurs when turning left | Went to the dealership and was told they haven't had any complaints about it | Not sure what it is but I sure hope my doesn't fall off | So far the gas mileage is good but haven't taken a long trip yet | Not really loving the plastic interior though |

 "words": Having put in over 8k miles in 3 months I've come to intimately know my car yeah 60 mile commutes to internship | It is overall a really great vehicle | Yes there are downsides the third row is cramped but to get a crossover with out that Highlander Flex costs around 5 grand extra | For the money that the Journey costs you get a lot of things no one else offers in the price range | The biggest downside I've found is fuel economy but I chose to sacrifice it for the other features | Hybrid Highlander near 40k awesome yes worth 12k extra no | I will say cruise control is friend it changes economy by 1 | 8 mpg on my experience 120miles day and instead of going 75 go 65

 "words": Have only had the car 4 days and the engine light has been on twice going in the shop for the second time | Makes a noise and the car vibrates between 40 and 45 mph | I am concerned that I have bought a LEMON | Only 4 days and going in the shop again and they don't know whats wrong | I should have never bought this car | Buyers beware | 
 "words": My transmission has had problems since day one and the dealership has been unable to duplicate the problem | 2 weeks ago it stuck in first gear | I drove it about 3 miles to the dealership and let the service manager ride with me to verify that I had a valid complaint | We drove several miles and it would not change out of 1st gear | I left it at the dealership and returned several days later only to learn that the transmission was working fine | Normally the transmission will slip and jerk in to gear after a delay | The Journey also will die for no apparent reason | The seats are uncomfortable and the ride is terrible | I would not recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": Less than 10K miles 4th time in shop | this time for CV shaft replacement | Twice for cowl which is currently on backorder | Car made thunking noise found out the motor mounts were never tightened at factory | When pulling into the grocerly store parking lot this car creaks and groans like a 10- year old used car with 150K miles | My brother-in-law told me to buy new to avoid someone else's headaches | Ha | I deserve this for listening to someone else's opinion | 
 "words": I have read other reviews here and I have to say that most of the complaints about the Journey are just absurd and elementary | Most all brands have plastic interiorspower wise this is not a sports carwe are consistently getting 18mpg in town and 25mpg highway | As far as transmission problemswe have have not experienced anybut that's not to say there aren't a few | As I drive around town I can't help notice all of the well marked courtesy vehicles from Mercedes BMWAcura and Lexus | Why do your think they are out there | Its not because they are getting an oil change | Most All brands have issues recalls | We have the SXT model | Overall we feel the Journey is a fantastic value for the money | 
 "words": My wife really wanted the 19 wheel package giving the vehicle a bigger look | Wow did we learn | This was a Demo unit when dodge dealers closing so got a great deal almost 10000 off | We have gone through 2 of the 19 Kumho tires | They are way to soft cant get them aftermarket | Discount tires is Dealer for Kohmo but fount like 1 tire in texas | New dealer does not care since we did not buy from them oh well | No warranty take it up with Kohmo | They want 360 per tire for replacement | Only tire made in that size or even close | 
 "words": I like most of the interior features the only things I have a problem with are the air conditioner has a slow cool down when car is started | Also I have a touch screen dvd stereo why put a dvd player on console if u can't see dvd while driving I would have preferred in in the back so kids could see it I have two seater no 3rd row seats | No air in back only from vents in front I can have floor storage but can't have back air | also fabric is White or light colors they should use less light and more darks colors even for grownups White is too hard to keep clean my brakes sound funny when stopping and have a lot of residue from brakes | I like the ride less noisy just want better gas mileage20 hwy

 "words": Leap for the V6 and the AWD with performance suspension | You will not find a better value for towing passenger capabilities and comfort with an AWD feature amongst any of its competitors | There is a glaring difference in the vehicle performance with either the 4-cyl or just the standard FWD suspension unit | All around solid and have not had any significant quality or performance issues the first 3000 miles | V6 with AWD will now only be available on the 2010 R T's | Model will be cannibalized by upcoming Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee as they are heading into the CUV platform | As Iacocca used to say If you can find a better car buy it | 
 "words": My main complaint is it's a wimpy V6 | Now maybe I'm used to the bigger Cummins Diesel power but this thing needs a little more juice and the gear ratio makes shifting a full time job when traveling doing hills | If you want the best performance you MUST shift manually and that gets tiring after all I bought an automatic | I think they could have done better | I also think the passenger side seat should be power also | The ride is very comfortable my husband finds it almost impossible to stay awake when we are traveling thus I end up doing all the driving | For the price I love the car will I keep it | Probably not after 2 years | 
 "words": one year old new radio replaced new brakes and rotars mirrors replaced strips on door entry break lights and tail lights fixed twice i guess can figure out problem because out again with no tail lights and the dealer can seem to fing the urgent issue even though i am driving around with my kids in the car sure i will wait another week again for the past few month to get my car in to have it looked at | and trans in slipping at time oh they cant never feel anything when they drive it around the parking lot and if that not enough 5 complaint that when turn in or out of a parkinspot driveway loud noise sound like a pump prb and the response ikeep gettingis all new cars sound like that
 "words": I bought this car in may of 2008 i came home with it and it had to go back to get the DVD installed which ended up being a huge issue because no one at the dealership was trained on how to work it same with the MYGIG | then we get it back the air bag light came on then we were back in the shop for another 6 weeks until they could figure out the problem now at 19k miles the brakes an rotors have to be replaced the dealership said that every 9k this is happening | calle the useless folks at Dodge headquarters they advise that this is normal wear and tear | also there is smoke that comes out from under the hood which i have been told is brake dust and that my car is 'safe' to drive | 
 "words": Decent car but cant get fixed | Dealer says can't get parts due to Dodge bankruptcy | Car in shop almost 3 weeks | Won't give loaner | Contacted Dodge and they will get back to me in 3 or 4 days | This is my first Dodge and it will be my last |

 "words": My original review was on Jan2 09 | To date this has been a good vehicle | It performed great during our northern winters and now has 14000Km on it | The only problems so far besides my original review is the panic alarm has gone off a few times when I use the key fob to unlock the doors | You need to manualy use the key to enter the vehicle and start the car to turn the alarm off | Very annoying for the neighbors at 4 30 am | This is a fun vehicle to drive and is very quiet | No defects other than what I have mentioned | Reliability is excellent | I'm getting ready to leave on a 5000Km trip | Gas mileage could be better the best I got was 8 | 9L 100km on highway with the air conditioning off | 
 "words": I absolutely love this vehicle | After shopping around we decided on a Journey for its combination of basic features and price | Our red V6 R T cruises effortlessly noiselessly and comfortably | It sits 7 and the layout is ingenious | Elegant less nerd than a mini van | Fun and well designed | Wholeheartedly recommend | 
 "words": Was this or the Nitro Liberty | The Journey is quieter drives smoother and has far more features | No contest | 
 "words": I was looking for the best value for my buck | The R T I bought 3 | 5 V 6 power seat traction con- control ESC self dimming mirror 5 star front and side crash rating etc | etc | some of the plastic appointments in the interior are a bit much but a out the door price of 19222- No other deal on any car came near that price | Oh yeah I forgot to mention the dual exhaust | chrome tail pipes and great fit of the exterior | 
 "words": I can't believe Chrysler is thinking of doing away with this vehicle | This is the best car I have ever owned | I was always a GM person being retired from there | But Gm can't come close to the Journey for the same price | Their Travers costs about 10000 more than the Journey | The excutives better rethink their decision to deep six the Journey | maybe they should do away with the Nitro and the Jeep Patriot instead of the Journey | If they do go ahead and discontinue the Journey I can see why the are the most disfunctional car company in the world | Maybe they should fire some of the excutives that are making these decisions | Why don't they advertise this gem instead their lousy trucks |

 "words":  I really haven't had it that long but I must say for a crossover you really get a lot of features and extras for teh price | It has a lot more leg room that it looks like from the outside | Drives smooth and handles very well | I have seen in other reviews that customers were not happy with the way thinterior is made that it is too cheap but I disagree | Yes it's not a lexus but for a mom driving her 5 yr old and 17 yr old around it is very sturdy and functional | It's easy to clean and takes the abuse that my boys have to offer LOL | It's also very easy to fold the seats down or scooter them forward very user friendly for a mom on the go | 
 "words": My 11 and 13 year old daughters love the Journey | They like to fold down the seats and stretch out during road trips | AC plug keeps all the electronic goodies charged | Beverages in the chill zone snacks under the floor and movies playing on the DVD | I consider the Journey a good value | I paid less than 24K with AWD 3 row seating MyGig Infinity Speakers and Sirius radio | I could not price anything within 5k that seated more than 5 | I frequently recommend the Journey to others | PS I think the MyGig radio below the heating controls works better in bright light | 
 "words": We had the Journey one day and every time we braked the car would feel like it jumped into another gear | To make a long story short the car had less than 300 miles and the transmission needs to be replaced | Yes that is right | We requested the dealer please just give us a new vehicle but they explained since it was already titled in our name they can't | We were assured they have the top service center at this dealership | Very dissappointed and upset |

 "words": We traded our 2007 Dodge MegaCab in on the Journey | We wanted something smaller that still had all wheel drive could tow 3000 lbs or more and could seat 5 comfortably | The Journey meets all of those qualifications | It's extremely quiet at highway speeds and has been delivering good highway mileage 24-25MPG | We love all of the storage the transmission shifts smooth and really enjoy sirius satellite radio | All in all we are very happy with our purchase | 
 "words": This car has been nothing but headaches and stress | A ticking noise coming from the engine per dealer rocker arms replace | Making same noise toke it back said Chrystal redesigned the rocker arms and replaced them again | Still making noise per Chrystal this is the characteristic of the rocker arms and I have a life time powertain warranty | That's crazy | Why would they redesign something to make the some noise | I pursing the lemon law | FIX THE PROBLEM | 
 "words": I enjoyed the fact that I could still have room not like a Excursion but like leg room | It is not a Ford Flex but the dealer was willing to work with me and my situation | Not that it was bad | Larger wheels came with the R T package and it is a lighter ride then the traditional Larger SUV's

 "words": I have now owed my Journey for four months and it has been in the shop for about a month of that time | I have had a new transmission installed at 6000 miles | I drove it for 4 days to have a pinion seal leak transmission fluid all over the parking lot | That repaired and now the new transmission is showing the same signs as the prior one | It does not want to shift smooth into second | I keep getting engine lights and they stated that I have an emmisons leak and they are working on finding that | The dealership is great with the repairs and the help with the car but no matter how much I love the car itself but it does not a reliable choice for someone driving as much as I do with the kids |
