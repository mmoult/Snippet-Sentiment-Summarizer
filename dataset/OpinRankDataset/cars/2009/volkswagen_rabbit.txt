REVIEWS
 "words": In my family we own an 09 Rabbit and 08 Mazda 3 | They are truly both fantastic cars | Both are equipped pretty much the same and they both cost the same just about 17K | My wife drives the Mazda and she loves it however I am a good size guy and I find the Rabbit's seat goes back further and has more thigh support and overall room | The Mazda gets better gas mileage but the Rabbit has better acceleration so in my opinion the lower MPG is a fair trade | Both handle extremely well and are a lot of fun to drive however the Rabbit is a little more quiet overall | The Mazda has one of the nicest stearing wheels I have ever seen on any car | 
 "words": Quick even at a 6500ft Colorado altitude | Precise handling | Precise- shifting 5-speed gearbox | Typical excellent German craftsmanship inside and outside with obvious attention to detail | Roomy | Lots of features that are package upgrages on other brands | Airbags everywhere traction stability management and other safety features | Good MPGs for the HP torque | On top of all that driving-thrill-for-the-investment can't be beaten | 
 "words": Quiet competent handles well and is fun to drive | Great quality fit and finish | 
 "words": Car has seen all types of driving and has fared extremely well | The engine in the car is well suited to most driving situations and the abundance of power and torque plus an engine that enjoys revving provides an acceleration not found in competitors the five speed manual has short throws and positive feel with good clutch feedback | Suspension is based on the sportier GTI giving the Rabbit surefooted dynamics while providing a comfortable ride even over harsh roads the standard ESP provides an added safety net | No problems while owning the vehicle and fuel economy has averaged approximately 28 miles per gallon while full tanks on the freeway can net up to 33 miles per gallon | 
 "words": I love driving this car It's really quiet smooth and pretty quick | Plus this car handles really well | Best of all is the gas mileage | I get about 26mpg all city traffic and about 29-30 with mixed city highway driving | The sticker estimated mpg is way low at 21 28 | 
 "words": Well built with more than expected standard features | Excellent performance and safety features | Interior of car feels like a much larger car | Average mileage has been 27 mpg in all around driving | Very quiet interior and smooth 6 spd tiptronic auto trans | I am extremely happy after 2 months with this gem | 
 "words": When it was time to trade in my old car a '95 I looked at nearly all of the cars in the 15-20K market | Drove the Mazda3 Vibe Versa Matrix Civic xD | they all kind of felt the same | I had resigned myself to a functional compact with few features that I could make do with | then I drove the Rabbit | WHOA it was like finding religion | There is absolutely no car in this class that is nearly as fun to drive | Plus even the base model is packed with extras | The interior is refined with quality materials | I got the 2-door 5-speed manual and I love it | I've never owned a VW before but the Rabbit has definitely made me a believer | 
 "words": I purchased a 2009 VW Rabbit after looking at other cars in its class including the Mitsubish Lancer GTS Mazda 3 and Subaru Impreza | While I think I could have been happy with any of the other cars mentioned I truly love my Rabbit | I could not justify the additional price of the GTI for a few fractions of a second faster from 0-60 mph and the added costs for premium fuel and insurance | The Rabbit will satisfy all but the most power hungry | Fuel economy is mediocre but a fair trade off for power and performance | The Rabbit has the best build quality not just in intelligent design but in the material used | It does not feel like a sub 20000 car nor does it drive like one | 
 "words": Just purchased brand new rabbit 2009 5 min after leaving dealership check engine light goes on when trying to merge on the highway car lost power pressing gas car actually slowing down lasted almost a minute not long but very scary just the same | Drove it back to dealership they gave a rented car while they diagnose the problem not a good start especially since its brand new I'm hoping this is the first and last problem | 
 "words": I was looking for a little hatchback | I picked the Rabbit over the Mazda 3 and Imprezza because it was more fun driving cost less and is supposed to get a little better mileage | It also got great CR ratings | I've had four people in it a few times and there seems to be enough room | The car reminds me of the civic hatchbacks from the early 90s | 
 "words": This bunny is a fun and comfortable ride even at German autobahn speeds 100mph | The bunny is just as roomy as my '03 Passat and easier to park in Europe's tight parking garages | I had one rough start on a chilly morning 5F maybe that Knock sensor acting up don't know for sure because it cleared itself up in a few seconds | I was soaked getting in once by water pooled on the roof run-off made it too my arm and leg before I could close the door | Need to be mindful of passenger side rear blind spot | 
 "words": I have driven 10000 kms since Sep 2008 and I generally find my Rabbit fun to drive | On 4 separate occasions though I have had the experience of putting my foot on the accelerator and got ZERO response | Fortunately to date this has only occurred from idle ie car was stationary | Having read your review I will take it to the dealership again and ask them to check the Knock Sensor | Thanks
 "words": The Rabbit is a very enjoyable car to drive | I've put 8000 miles on it so far and find it both comfortable and fun | The torque supplied in the low range is a great change from most newer cars that save the power to above 5000rpms | My wife and I fight over driving this car daily rather than the SUV we have | 
 "words": I just got my 2009 Rabbit 3 weeks ago and I mostly love it | It has a cozy feel the dash is easy to use the lights are distinct and easy to read and it handles nicely even in snow which we've had about every day since I got it | It has a jaunty overall feel and I am quite pleased overall | The sales staff was also really informed and helpful | 
 "words": The best way to describe the Rabbit is solid | The steering and braking are nicely weighted | the doors and hatch make a nice thunk when closed | acceleration is smooth and strong | Spacious for a compact car | 
 "words": I went from a 4 door Tacoma to the rabbit | Never again will I buy a truck | Fits my 63 self wife and newborn perfectly | Awesome display speakers ride is sooo quite and smooth | All these complaints on the mph I have had no such issues | Nor have I had any issues with blind spots | A blast to drive slow or fast | Aux hook up for the ipod is always a plus satellite radio is an option on some | Auto door locks after 30 seconds is a great for safety | 
 "words": I could not be more pleased with the bang for buck total | Its quick fast quiet comfortable and stable fit and finish are way above price point | For me there is no comparable car in this class also not many on road that is dominated by Asian vehicles | 
 "words": I had a 2006 Rabbit for a short time it was totaled in an accident which influenced my decision to buy my 2009 Rabbit recently | The Rabbit feels like a solid well-built car | It's a fun car to drive with its 170 horsepower and the 6-speed Tiptronic transmission | The controls are easy to use and the layout is logical | The seats are comfortable and the interior is roomy | I like the overall look of the Rabbit inside and out | I like the features too | The stereo sounds great and is easy to use | Standard Electronic Stability Program is a nice touch | The engine is smooth and seems quieter than my 2006 Rabbit | Fuel economy could be better | iPod operation is buggy and not intuitive | 
 "words": Just went from an 07 Corolla to the 09 Rabbit | Couldn't be happier | Great performing and sounding engine nice handling with perfect body roll extremely solid feel on the highway fun to drive roomy excellent safety features decent but not great stereo nice transmission and generally good looks make it a winner | The Corolla is a good but very pedestrian car | The Rabbit literally blows it away in the fun to drive category and comes with all the standard safety features that make the difference | 
 "words": I love driving this car | I went from a pickup truck to the Rabbit | I didn't realize what a dog my truck was until driving the Rabbit every day | It's quick shifts great handles tight fast lane changes are easy and smooth | I wanted a Mini Cooper S and the Rabbit gives me that sporty agile ride | I would not trade hp for better mileage | The engine is Great | Took a road trip on Thanksgiving and enjoyed the car | The cruise controls and audio controls were very intuitive and after a couple hundred miles I didn't miss them not being in the steering wheel | Its a very nice wheel so don't not buy the car just because the controls are not in it | You will forget about it quickly enough | 
 "words": I traded in a 2001 Outback and was afraid the Rabbit would feel so much smaller it's not at all | The mpg is better than the Outback even with 1 more cylinder | I was expecting entry level features and was surprised by the thought that was put into the design | I drive out to the mountains a lot and am pleasantly surprised at how my bunny scampers up a steep grade | I had a Rabbit diesel in the 80s and am so glad I thought to try a Rabbit again | I couldn't be more pleased | 
 "words": Excellent car that handles extremely well on the road | Negotiates curves like a charm | I got this after wrecking my 07 Mazda 3 through no fault of my own | The Mazda was a good car but this one blows it out of the water | The Rabbit offers a smoother ride a tighter turn radius and generally a better grip on the road | Also the Mazda is more expensive if you add all the features that is standard in the Rabbit | Its worth mentioning that because of this car's higher safety rating my insurance went down significantly | From the outside the car looks simple but in my opinion that simplicity gives it a more distinguished look | The laser welded body is a big plus | 
 "words": My White little Rabbit dominates the small car genre easily in Sport | Test driving other small American and Japanese cars felt like a waste of time after riding in VW's 09 Rabbit | The Focus is hard to focus on after you are behind the wheel of a fully powered Rabbit | 
 "words": Great little car it feels very solid compared to other small cars in class | Independent suspension great 6 speed transmission 5 cylinder engine add up to a lot of value for about 18K | Uncluttered instrument panel | Drivers seat great for taller drivers | Gets up and goes when it needs to | 
 "words": I wanted a small sedan | One test drive of Civic and Corolla and they were out | Those sheep need to look around a little | Mazda3 is a good car and better value but this one just felt like it was built better | I picked the Rabbit over the Jetta because of the chrome on the front and the fake leather seats I just couldn't do it | The real stuff is better why bother | Also Rabbits are unusual around here | I've enjoyed the car so far | It really IS fun to drive | Plenty of power | NO exterior loud obnoxious things about it | A real knock out in red | I can't believe this car is not more popular | 
 "words": Very nice | I love my 2009 Rabbit | Its fun it's swift and surprisingly roomy | It fits 2 adults in the back quite nicely | I don't know who the previous reviewer was trying to fit in his 2 door | I have had 3 girlfriends squeeze in the back | I wanted all the standard safety features | Mazda 3 does not offer ESP standard | Even after reading all the bad reviews of the previous models with electronic breakdowns i still got the Bunny and I love it | 
 "words": This car is an amazing car to get | I paid 17325 and got a lot of excellent features | This car feels good to drive in and when your already tired from driving the car wont get you more tired | 10 speaker German sound will wake you up | For a 2009 this is more likely the best car to get | Gas is the issue but for the performance and comfort it's well worth it | I am a mechanic and it seems to that this car is excellent for every day driver | Engine temp stays at 190f and even on 12 hour drives it does | Highest mpg was 28 so far | This car has the same concept of the VW golf | But way better
 "words": The handling is still a little unresponsive but VW definitely put some thought into this car | Fuel mileage is a little bad but coming from 20 27 I'm good | There are little easter eggs in this car that a good run-through should show | Stereo system could be improved as it sounds like I'm listening through two old computer speakers but who buys the base and expects premium sound | Radio reception and sound are much better than I expected | The back seat is big enough to fit maybe one person comfortably but don't through two adults back there | Also you don't even notice the lack of arm rest if you decide to opt out of the iPod dock | But that's more a personal preference | All in all get it | 
 "words": I do a lot of serious driving and over the years I have found that I need a car that will act like a car and perform like a car when I demand from it | The Rabbit does just that | You're not bulking around a huge vehicle and so you are able to zip in and out of the rest of the traffic | The 5 cylinder engine with its 170 hp is plenty powerful enough and the car has a whole lot of get-up-and-go | I got the 5 speed manual version of the Rabbit because let's face it it's the only way to truly drive a VW | You're in command at all times | The air conditioning is great and it has an excellent 10 speaker quality stereo system with ipod connect and in-dash CD changer | You need this car | 
 "words": I believe the Rabbit is the best buy for the buck | My wife has an A-4 3 | 2 and this is like a cousin | The German feel | Great acceleration and just simply fun to drive | The Corolla and Civic appear very refined but are just mini town cars | Compare and you have the most features for your dollar | ESP standard in 09 |
