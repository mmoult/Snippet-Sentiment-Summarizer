REVIEWS
 "words": New dad with rapidly-growing infant | Reliability comfort convenience were top considerations | Like other reviewers compared Odyssey to Sienna Quest VW as well as against large SUVs | Found Odyssey to be best combination of features utility design for the price and for our needs | Purchased end-of-year model with 40 miles on odometer for about 1600 under invoice | Drives more like a car albeit a Honda and not a BMW surprisingly roomy cavernous cargo space when 3rd row is folded down intuitive ingenious fold-down 3rd row trouble-free through first 500 miles | Solid feel throughout | Plastic dash but that's what you get for about 25K | 
 "words": We've had this van for about 6 months now and are very satisfied with our purchase | Just got back from a 3000 mile road-trip to Florida and averaged the EPA stated 23 mpg with a full load | At purchase time we got almost 6000 off of MSRP when deals were good prior to cash for clunkers which certainly influenced our decision and I still think it is a great value | No mechanical problems to date | I read through some other reviews and folks mention the road noise and the way the transmission shifts | Nothing that bothers our family but do take a long test drive with a mix of city and highway roads before purchasing any vehicle don't assume you'll love it just because it's a Honda | 
 "words": A First ever Mini in my life looked at Sienna others stopped once I drove this one | It's not really a van more like a car | Dealership did an excellent price as well no others would come this low price wise for less quality | Roomy classy and you can still look like a cool guy | lol | My boys love it lots of storage for sports stuff and as my oldest says wow there are a lot of cup holders | 
 "words": Love the Odyssey BUT don't get the VCM model | There is a low growl drone vibration you can feel and hear when it kicks into 3 cyl mode | Especially in cold weather | HONDA WON'T disable it and claims that the noise is normal | VCM doesn't activate when the engine is cold during the first 5 min of driving so there must be a way to disable it programmatically | There also is a loss of power that is noticeable during VCM cruise on slight inclines | This causes the mph to drop well below your cruise setting | I prefer to eat the fuel savings if any than put up with this annoyance | It is extremely noticeable at 40 and 70 mph and when fully loaded | Must be at just the right rpm's | 
 "words": We bought this vehicle with a 2400 mile Disney World trip in mind | It practically drove itself there and had us convinced we were in a luxury sedan | Driving feel was sporty | Mileage was 23 mpg despite using a c even while parked often and driving 65-80 mph | At home it's closer to 16 mpg | Our son runs to get in and has never mentioned the SUV he used to love so much | My wife hated to buy a minivan but fights over who gets to drive it next | 
 "words": I must have test driven each of these cars at least 3 times | In the end I got an Odyssey because I got the better deal and more options | The Honda was fun | Downside Honda road noise is awful and after several weeks I feel like I'm driving a tank with no pick up | The passenger seat feels like it teeters when you accelerate or stop | And the stitching on the steering wheel has come unraveled | The passenger doors don't open close fast enough | I'm happy with the van see pros below but I wish I had gotten the Sienna despite its boring appearance | 
 "words": I have had 3 other vans all Chryslers which had turned to go to all cars back in 2000 | I decided to try one more time and I have been pleasantly surprised | The Ody is really comfortable is solid as a rock no rattles quiet and with the rear camera has great visibility | The disappearing 3rd row is great and the rear well when the seat is up provides an excellent space for loads of packages suitcases etc | The mileage is at the top end of the EPA estimate and has exceeded the estimate on several recent trips verified by actual calculation not just the trip computer | The leather seats are the most comfortable and supportive I've had in a vehicle under 50000 | 
 "words": After our third came around it was time to move up in terms of size with our vehicles | This is our second Honda product so no real surprises in build material quality which as been good so far | The van has been very functional and the power doors are great | The space within the van is excellent as is the driving characteristics of the vehicle | Gas mileage is been in the middle 20's so far but I will expect less during the winter | The children love the van and taking long trips has been a much more pleasant experience for the whole family | 
 "words": Had a 2006 odyssey lease | Love the new EXL with auto tailgate | Researched many models and bought the best | Got a very fair price and good dealer experience | Also great for traveling holds everything for a months vacation | Also like our color choice which is dark cherry | Very pleased with our purchase | 
 "words": There's no surprise that the Odyssey is 1 of the best selling mini-vans on the market today | Solid build quality reliable comfortable and versatile | Fuel economy has averaged 22 23 mpg with 80 hwy 20 city driving | 
 "words": Previously owned a Toyota Sienna Van | Liked the car but went to buy a new one and they did not want to deal | Price for Honda EX-L with Nav and RES was amazing right out of the gate | So we bought it | The van is good but disappointed in Honda | They seem stuck in the past with basic styling | The van is built well but the exterior is boring | The van is loaded BUT I am so upset that with all the great features that there are basics missing | Automatic lights are not on the van | We leave the lights on once a week | Basics of Miles to empty | It has a nav system but I can't tell me how many miles until empty | The van is good | don't love it but it's good | 
 "words": Well I never thought I'd say it but I love my new minivan | I've only had it a week but I don't know how I got along without it before | The power sliding doors and tailgate are awesome | It is so easy to get my kids in and out of the car now | The carseats are easy to configure and install in this vehicle | My baby's infant seat fits perfectly behind my seat even with seat back to accommodate my longer legs' length | So far my only complaint is that there is only one 12V outlet in the front of the van so I can't charge my Garmin and cell phone at the same time | My previous ride was a 2006 Pilot and I had three outlets within arm's length | Despite this I'm still lovin' my new Ody | 
 "words": The VCM activates deactivates about 150 times per 100 miles | Each time it activated I lost about 2-4 mph while on 70mph cruise control | When it deactivates VCM | all of the cylinders kick back in and I was back up to my cruise control setting speed of 70mph | Rather annoying especially when you have vehicles in front and behind you and they are at a steady cruise speed | Down to 3 cylinders is when you hear and feel an annoying growling | Then a loss of power and you lose speed | HONDA please put in a switch to disengage the 3 cylinder mode which I believe is the issue | The 4 cyl mode doesn't seem to be a problem | From NY to FL I experienced the same | 
 "words": We are on our third Odyssey and will likely go for a fourth | The 09 Touring has great features and functionality and keeps on getting better compared to our 04 and 05 | Road noise is non-existent fuel economy is 22 city and 28 highway | The radio is well placed and logical and the nav has everything including a compass | I paid 40 off of the 42K sticker due to dealer hunger | First time I have felt good about my purchase price | 
 "words": This is my second Honda Odyssey | My first was a 2003 Odyssey EX | I have had a history of selling my cars after 2-3 years | My last Odyssey I had over 6 | 5 years-130000 miles with nothing wrong with it | Only scheduled service | My husband also swore HE would never buy a Honda OR a minivan | When I was pg with my first child he was completely SOLD with the Odyssey- enough to get him to buy a Pilot a year later | SO when we got the new one it was a no brainer | I didn't even have to shop the market | The leather interior is beautiful | The basics are the same as the 2003 but they made it more luxurious and FUN | Wouldn't trade it for the world | 
 "words": Great family car with excellent mileage | Gave about 27 mpg when driven to Niagara from Columbus | Love the leather and interior design | Automatic back door and sliding doors are must have feature for minivans | Paid 28750 OTD price with 2 | 9 APR | Can't beat the price with the standard features that comes with this minivan while comparing with other vans | 
 "words": I have 2300 miles on my Odyssey and I get in my estimation very poor gas mileage | I told the service adviser when I went there that I thought that when the motor was idling it seems kind of high rpm and he had the mechanic check and said it was normal | I am not happy | After several tankfuls I filled the tank again this morning and am getting 17 | 42 miles per gallon and I drive mostly highway miles | 
 "words": Our family absolutely loves this van | We have a 2009 EXL-RES | The rear entertainment system RES is a pleasure on trips | It allows the front drivers to listen to music while the kids watch their videos through the wireless headphones | Driving comfort and space is outstanding | The van is quiet and has very good road manners | The Odyssey replaced a Toyota Highlander for us | We were seriously considering the Sequoia for this purchase | We just found this to be a better vehicle for the money than the Sequoia | We are now van converts | 
 "words": I am currently leasing the 2009 EX-L model with rear entertainment | I have been very impressed so far | The comfort is great | The cargo space is excellent | I wasn't very excited about crossing over into the minivan world as a former SUV driver but I've actually enjoyed the switch | 
 "words": The Odyssey is best-of-breed | Great build-quality and very functional | Where other brands put money into bells and whistles Honda focuses instead on a great drive-train top-notch suspension steering and supportive seating | We have had the Towne and Country and Grand Caravan | The Honda is a more responsive vehicle that leaves the driver feeling in-control | 
 "words": First van and feel confident with picking the Honda | Drives great | Highway fuel economy higher then expected | Interior is quite spacious and the leather interior makes it feel more luxurious | Navi and RES is awesome | Sound system is ok but then again it is a minivan | Overall an excellent choice for families who require room | 
 "words": Sold 11 yr running Dodge Caravan bought 09 Honda Odyssey | Had for about 3 months took out west | Before return home took drive to Sedona AZ lost power on National Forest Road w few places to pull over van towed to dealership on Sunday | Monday told the whole upper engine destroyed by disintegrated bolt needed days to repair | Afraid to drive it home about 1800 miles to Ohio | Informed insurance agent of manufacturer defect if something else happens to investigate van | Seriously worried we could have been in bad accident | Honda disinterested in our concerns repaired to their satisfaction not ours | 
 "words": We just recently upgraded from a Saturn Vue to the Honda Odyssey | We couldn't be happier with the upgrade | At first the wife was worried about her coolness factor and driving a minivan but after driving it for a few weeks she is in love with the room and convenience | I like it for the features and handling | On many occasions now I've been driving at highway speeds when a light turns red and I'm worried about stopping in time an was initially surprised that I stopped with no problem and had room to spare | In the Vue I would have had trouble stopping | The seats are comfortable everything seems to be of good build quality | 
 "words": We were in the market for our first minivan narrowing the search to a Sienna or Odyssey | Odyssey's ability to load and control the DVD from the front with 2 small kids is a big win | Ultimately though Honda was willing to negotiate more than Toyota with an offer below the TMV What Others are Paying quote below invoice | Have had the van for almost a month | no issues with noise great mileage avg | 21 mpg with a mix of highway city driving love the handling | 
 "words": I've owned two Honda odysseys | A 2007 Odyssey Touring that met a deer late at night and a 2008 Odyssey EX-L bought new after the 2007's accident | Both vehicles have been completely reliable a joy to own and drive and perfect for my family | However one big surprise | Even with the 34 6 cylinder switching engine the fuel economy has been averaging 13- 14 mpg | I'm not an aggressive driver and now that I know I'm getting this mileage I've been trying to improve it but with not a lot of success | On long trips things certainly improve but around town gas mileage is my biggest disappointment | I expected better maybe 17-18 | 
 "words": We replaced our 1999 Plymouth Grand Voyager with this 2009 Honda Odyssey LX | We like to shop for quality products but our budget is also a limiting factor | The LX is a great way to get quality without having to break the bank | We got everything we need in a minivan including excellent quality without the added expense of features we don't really need | If you can live without power seats power sliding doors a high end stereo leather etc | then the LX is a great choice | Mechanically its really the same van as the high end model | You just need to be ready to open your own door and perhaps read a map if you really don't know where you're going | 
 "words": We love our new Odyssey | We had good luck with our 2000 Grand Caravan but the Honda looked better this time | We have just a few minor issues though the digital displays are all over the dash and look like they were borrowed from a ten dollar watch | The clock and climate control settings are hard to see when the sun is out and there's no constant display of the odometer except as one of three or four display options with the trip computer | And what's with no compass | The daytime running lights headlights have confused me as I have an automatic headlight switch on my other vehicle | 
 "words": Very impressed | I love the minivan just like my 3rd child I only got 2 children | The engine is smooth quiet and powerful | It's the best car we've ever bought | 100 Satisfaction | No complaint at all | Just bought it 3 weeks ago with 1 mile on it when brand new | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Ody | The first one an '03 EX-L was bullet-proof | Got as much as 26 mpg on the highway | Our new 2009 is even more refined | Much more plush interior nicer exterior colors and lines | Features like power liftgate and backup camera are super useful | Some complain that their new Ody rides rough | Actually it reminds me of the driving feel of my Bimmer | You can definitely feel the road | but it's a good refined feeling not a rough feeling | Interior noise about the same as the old one | The one complaint I have is with the Plus-One center seat for the 2nd row | I find it nearly unusable | First you can't stow it | On earlier models you could but no longer | 
 "words": We just love our 2009 Odyssey EX-L with RES | It feels just like our Accord | Drive The drive is smooth and comfortable | Accelerates well | Comfort We just love the leather interior really comfortable seats | One drawback though is the Steering Wheel should extend out a little farther for a little more comfort | I am 5'-6 and sometimes I find it hard to rest my arms on the arm rest and still be able to grip the steering comfortably | Anyone looking at buying the Odyssey should consider this | Interior Design We just love the design | The fold-away center tray in the first row is a great thing to have | It makes moving from the front to the back so much easier especially with kids | 
 "words": We got our first minivan a few days ago after doing research between Odyssey and Sienna for several months | We finally decided to go with Odyssey because of the safety rating the roomy third row seats and better value for the price | It is really fun driving this car | Though we never drove a big car before we find it extremely easy and pleasant to drive this car | The whole family loves this car | 
 "words": I originally did not consider a Honda thinking it was going to be too expensive | But after comparing costs with other less expensive options the Honda stood out | Exterior has great stylings for a minivan and the interior is roomy and luxurious | Drives like a car | I can hardly wait for my first trip | Auto doors are a feature I never really thought about but I love them | What's more the wife and kids love it | 
 "words": This vehicle replaced a 2000 Town Country Limited that literally fell apart on me | I liked the ride a little better on that vehicle but the Odyssey is extremely well-designed in terms of day-to-day practicality | That even extended to the pre-drilled bolt-holes that allowed me to install a trailer hitch in about a 1 2 hour using only a socket wrench | The Honda's principal drawbacks are that it is noisier than other minivans and the entertainment system is too complicated | Plus it's wider than other minivans which makes garage parking harder | 
 "words": Honda is a well reputed co | so we bought the minivan | Having said that overall I am very happy with the interior room | But it lacks features and the most disturbing thing of all is the road wind noise | If you plan to go out with family on long trips this is not a van for you | Noise level is high and makes the journey a bit of a torture | Also lack of power outlet is a big disappointment | Will look elsewhere for my next car van | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Honda Odyssey | First had 105k miles 6 years and we paid sticker no discounts | This time we looked at Toyota Nissan and Ford | Ford Toyota and Nissan were basically offering invoice pricing which is what they did last time not great deals | Honda was 28 off sticker and way below invoice listed on websites | Way different than last time we bought from Honda | This van was thousands less expensive than what Nissan or Toyota would do | Ford was not that great either | Now I know why Honda has the best year over year sales figures | They know what market they are dealing in | I have a 2000 Acura RL with 115k but can't get Acura to do a deal | strange | 
 "words": My wife and I considered the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna but liked the overall looks and reputation of Honda | The one option we both wanted living up here in the frozen north are heated seats | At first we only wanted the EX model but had to purchase the EX-L to get the heated seat option along with the other options that came with the EX-L | This cost us over 3000 | 00 extra all because we wanted heated seats | After buying the Honda taking it home and reading into the owners manual discovered that only the drivers seat was fully heated not the passenger seat which is only heated on the seat portion | Honda should have had this information on their brochures | 
 "words": Love it | I have a 2004 Town County which has been the most unreliable vehicle owned | The TC does seem to have a more comfortable ride as the Honda has a more car feel to the drive | However the safety ratings and extra space as well as reliability ratings makes this a much better investment for the money | The drive in comfortable and the kids love the exterior look a little sportier than the TC | We cannot wait to move up to the EX-L or Touring in a few years | 
 "words": Picked up my first Honda and first mini van a week ago and so far it's been very good experience | I haven't driven it lots yet but so far I really like how it drives | Love the backup cam and power sliding door and tailgate | I do find the VCM is more obvious than it felt on the van I test drove | I also felt it more when the gear downshift as I am gliding along with the foot off the gas pedal and running with the ECO light on | Mileage so far hasn't been as good as I expected but we are just about 500km into the break-in phase of the vehicle so hope it gets better | Will write another review in a few months after the break-in period is over | Considered Sienna but like styling of Honda
 "words": We just bought the LX and have been driving it for a few days | The car is easy to handle and the ride is pretty smooth | I know it is an base model but for safety reasons with children in mind I wish Honda would just make all their models with electronic doors | I would have loved to purchase the EX but could not afford the price | Also would prefer the review mirrors to be a bit larger as their is a blind spot area that is hard to catch | Second design the radio closer to the driver so you're not having to reach so far over to work the radio some people are short | Finally I think a tray similar to the one in the front should also be placed between the second row seats | 
 "words": I spent the extra money on a Honda because my friends told me the Chrysler was unreliable | But the Honda's check engine light came on after 20 miles and is still on | The dealer can turn it off for me if I drive the 20 miles back to the dealer | The road noise is worse than my 4Runner the seats are less comfortable there are fewer features and the VCM feature stopped working when the engine light came on | I want my 4Runner back | 
 "words": This is our sixth Honda product first van | Love the way Honda packages models so you don't have to buy an option you don't want just to get something you do want | Great quality that we expect from Honda | Odyssey has definitely lived up to it's reputation | Lot's of fun features to keep kids and dads happy | 
 "words": After months of flipping between Odyssey and Sienna I am a very happy owner of a Honda | Its fun to drive and turns like a normal car | Doesn't feel when you are driving a van only when you see the space it feels like a spaceship | 
 "words": Just purchased my first Honda and first minivan | It just came off the assembly line two weeks ago and the family could not be more excited | Having driven sports cars sedans and wagons up until this point I can honestly say after a short adjustment to the driving dynamic of a van it is just wonderful | Having the unusual ability to detect even the smallest fault there is a slight rattle buzz above driver's head area but the radio easily compensates | It is a living room on wheels the kids have plenty of room and love all the options variations space | Insanely comfortable amazing visibility plenty of power and a VCM system that is nearly imperceptible | On the first half tank 19 mpg city | 
 "words": Just traded in a 2007 MB CLS550 for a more practical vehicle | no regrets | This minivan is more useful and spacious than our MB GL450 | Touring model wonderful in that no options apply comes fully loaded | avoid the PAX system however expensive to replace the tires | Sound system DVD player navigation system are user friendly | Cylinder deactivation of 3 | 5L V6 is great enabling 26 mpg on highway | Amount of storage space without folding 3rd row seats flat is astonishing | I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone with kids and dogs we have one child and 2 dogs | 
 "words": Our van is used for both in town grocery getting and long road trips | We typically get 18 mpg in suburban driving and 25 mpg on the interstate | Once you get over the I'm driving a mini van syndrome it is highly functional and drives like a car | We just went to the Chicago Auto Show to look for alternatives | Many smaller vehicles get less mileage have greater depreciation and cannot do all of the things a minivan can | Can't wait to take our tandem bike to Florida and escape from the Chicago winter | 
 "words": Really nice van | When you drive it you know it is quality | Gas mileage seems average for a van | Stereo stinks replace with better speakers Can't go wrong with a Honda
 "words": I admit no one buys a minivan for driving excitement but Honda does a good job of making a vehicle whose main purpose is functionality seem fun to drive | It does everything we ask of it and actually remains reasonably fun to drive | Mileage is pretty good and park assist is a great help | We're really happy with it after 4 months of driving | 
 "words": So far a typical quality vehicle I expect from Honda | After 20 years of Civics this is my first Honda Minivan and I love it | It is replacing a 1998 Sienna | The Odyssey is feature-rich and has good looks to boot | The rear entertainment system with headphones is a godsend | The dash is a bit intimidating at first but every day we are learning how to use another feature | I was skeptical of the zone climate controls but the are effective and work nicely | 
 "words": We have had our Odyssey for two months and have 0 problems and love it | We had our second child in January and the Odyssey is wonderful for our boys | Overall quality has been excellent | Wouldn't own anything else after driving every mini-van available | Wish fuel economy would be better but not a reason not to drive it | 
 "words": Solid comfortable smooth sporty performance for a minivan | Quality of interior materials design is top notch | Exterior I think it is the best looking minivan on the market | If you have young children and you can get over the soccer mom image you will very satisfied with tis vehicle | It is the ideal people cargo mover | The 2nd row seats can be removed very easily | The 3rd row fold down easily as well | The interior is roomy even the third row is comfortable for adults | Not many crossovers can say that | 2nd row magic seat is for children | Gas mileage is impressive for such a large vehicle | It is easy to see why it is rated number one by so many professional reviewers | 
 "words": I have a stalling problem my Honda dealer and another will not fix | It stalls every time I get hard on the gas pedal | I have been on the 400 trying to merge and the van just dies | I have it towed to Honda but they can't find anything wrong | I don't like this van as much as my old Caravan | It not very reliable | I think I made a big mistake | 
 "words": Interior comfort is unrivaled | This is my second Odyssey | First was a 2001 | Drove it until wrecked this year on the highway | Wife stopped in traffic when she was plowed at 55 mph from behind | Pushed her into a semi | Car is crushed she is fine | The updates like the rearview mirror backup camera are awesome | Considered a volvo XC90 | but it doesn't remotely have the room of the odyssey | Kids can ride in comfort on long trips | Car has every airbag in the world | Auto sliding doors | auto sunroof | sliding door windows now go down | Now a power lift gate too | Air heat controls for all three rows of seats | Only complaint is cupholders too far away for little ones in the second row to use
 "words": We owned a 2005 Odyssey and loved many of its features | It was fun and easy to drive although the mileage was a little below advertised | We were very pleased with the vehicle overall and it met all of family's needs but we started having several of the problems that other owners of the 2005 model reported rattles power steering pump brakes so we decided to trade in for a 2009 model | So far we have been delighted with the new vehicle and Honda seems to have upgrades in several of these areas | We can't wait to see how this Honda holds up | 
 "words": With three little boys under the age of 6 I finally decided to get a practical safe and reliable minivan | I owned an accord in the mid 90s so I knew they were reliable | Well come to find out things have changed | Since day 2 the check engine engine light has been on and my Honda has seen more of the mechanic in three weeks than my 9 year old Land Rover has in the past year | It's a shame because the primary reason one purchases a Honda is for its reliability |

 "words": Do not buy the PAX model | The tires only last 25000 miles if that and they cost 1500 for a set of four | This means that by the time you hit 50000 miles when most tires wear out you will have spent 4500 on tires | If you get a flat Honda recommends you buy 2 new tires because the tires are not repairable | Nice going Honda | 
 "words": Look the its a good van but way too much for the price | I should gone with my gut instincts and bought the Toyota Sienna | I listened too much to Model Review experts and not my heart | The Sienna rode like a dream much better in my opinion than the reviews | The Honda makes a louder noise when accelerating on the highway than the Sienna | Toyota also offered a lot more standard features than Honda did | I listened to my wife and I should have changed her mind | Honda is good but the Sienna' s Style performance and overall quiet powerfully safe star rating is superb | I am probably going to trade in my Honda for the Sienna | 
 "words": I've had mine for about two months and I am very disappointed | Came out of a Caravan lease that had no issues for the entire time I had it | The Odyssey has squeaking brakes doors rattle and the DVD player skips | Try telling our 4 year old that the movie has to start all over again all the way to Florida | Not pretty | I wouldn't recommend the Honda
