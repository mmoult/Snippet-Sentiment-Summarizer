REVIEWS
 "words": I bought my car just over a year ago and I have no complaints about it | I hear some that say it doesn't live up to the fuel economics but I drove from San Diego to Washington averaging 31 mpg | If that's not good enough for you then buy a prius | Car has been great and everything that I bought it for | Fun to drive and decent power for how much it weighs | Wish I would have waited for the Ralliart | 
 "words": This is an amazing car for what it is | Value and character | For one of the few AWD cars on the market with a straight 4 and the turbo provides amazing power from 20-120mph and is a dead accurate vehicle | Shifts are precise engine is solid turbo is ample | Just a true joy to drive when you are in the mood | However it's not a great highway cruiser or Sunday driver it's a harsh and loud ride with little insulation and driver amenities | I use this car for a 65 mile commute daily round trip and it has its downfalls | Noise moderate fuel mileage VERY SMALL GAS TANK and loud overall with performance tires | But it is what it is performance car with power to spare character to match | 
 "words": I disagree with the other people saying the fuel mileage is bad | i drove this car from Kileen Texas to Colorado Springs and averaged around 33-35mpg | Both trips | The only thing I don't really like about the base models is the HP | It shoulda been upped a little compared to the newer 4cyl | N A cars out there but nice car looks mean in the front | 
 "words": The lancer drives very well | It's as quiet as any of it's competitors as corolla etc | It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car | It's engine a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant | I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use | The car is very safe and sturdy uses very strong steel | The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007 | And when you drive it it seems like it's below the epa estimates also especially city | 
 "words": Love the car so far | Graphite Gray | Had an old car with a huge V8 | Gas mileage is not perfect but much better than old car by a large margin | Interior has nice style but the quality does lack behind | I thought interior in GTS was better than the ES model | It is a comfortable car for me I'm 510 | Spoiler does block the view but you get used to it | For a 4 cyl it is pretty powerful but it could have more power | The back seat has a decent amount of room along with the trunk for a compact sedan | Overall a pretty decent car for the price | Got mine for a great deal so can't complain | If looking for a cheaper compact sedan that has a little bit of sportiness the Lancer is for you | 
 "words": The car drives handles great | Put 3k miles on it in the 1st 3wks we had it w not one issue | MPG was better than advertised | 32 mpg w the A C on most of the time | That's from Calif to Colorado and back | Great hands free Bluetooth system | Cruse Control works well and the stereo is not bad for a stock system | 
 "words": I bought this car a week ago using the cash for clunkers deal | I wanna add that the deal is a real pain but worth it | Ultimately this was an awesome buy great car for the money | Its fun to drive amazing looking handles well I'm averaging 26 mpgs and the warranties are great | What I have to complain about it the rear spoiler although adds to the aggressive look I love its does become a pain when looking in my mirror | Also this car needs a 6th gear but then again what car doesn't | I'm so glad I got this over the Impreza I just hope my opinion stays that way come winter | 
 "words": Positive Very stylish with nice exterior and interior great handling and braking | The ac works great | Fuel economy around 25 mpg in mix driving | Negative Noisy acceleration could be better
 "words": I bought my 2009 Lancer GTS in 2008 | I was shopping for a used more fuel efficient car as I was driving a BMW SUV | I miss having the SUV but not filling it up with gas | I call my Lancer my little techno-bile | That's why I bought it for all the latest stuff-really the bluetooth | The sound system is great but I miss having the Bose that my Infiniti had | For the Lancer price loaded you can't touch a BMW or Infiniti | I miss the leather seating | Love the Octane Blue color | Got a special coating put on it aftermarket to save the paint from chipping and fading | Good investment | I also added a billet grill as I thought the plastic grill was cheezy- looking | 
 "words": I've had the car for about 3 weeks now and could not be happier | Was able to get the 0 financing promo too which saved me thousands over the term of the loan | The car handles great and is just fun to drive | I highly recommend the manual transmission its smooth hydraulic clutch and short throw shifts really add some fun to the daily drives to work | Also the appearance package is a must it gives the car a great aggressive look | The leather wrapped steering wheel has a great feel and quality to it | I think there is plenty of pickup to the 2 | 0 | I passed on the GTS because of the 18in rims and performance tires | I live in NY I didn't want to have to buy snow tires and switch them on every year | 
 "words": I purchased this car on April 30th as my first new car after graduating college | I considered the Subaru Impreza and Mazda 3 but was blown away by the price standard features and performance of the Lancer | The 5 speed is fun and smooth | The engine could have more power but with average 28-30 mpg I can't complain | Build quality seems to be great so far | The ES comes standard with many nice features such as steering wheel mounted audio controls and alloy wheels | You don't need to spend a lot of money to get a great looking Lancer | The ES comes standard with many great features | Sure there are always improvements but for the price it's hard to beat | I highly recommend it | 
 "words": I was in the market for a fun-to-drive compact car with A T | I liked the GTI's power and paddle shifters the Civic EX-L with its stylish exterior and the Zoom-zoom feedback from the 2010 Mazda3 hatchback GT | However I've found that the perfect combination of these features exists on a Lancer GTS with all three available packages sun sound technology and touring | Sure it hasn't got the power of a GTI but who redlines their cars on a daily basis | It handles just like a Mazda3 with lots of excitement and it looks much better than all of the above mentioned models | At a price tag of a mere 22500 w rebatestax I can see myself smiling and enjoying this sweet ride for years to come | 
 "words": I have had my Lancer GTS for nearly a year and let's just say it is going away | The power is not bad | but heaven forbid you have to use the A C | It sucks SO much power from the engine | Mileage is as expected but I can't get over the complete lack of power in this thing | Interior is not all bad | seats could be a bit more comfortable on longer trips | The NAV system is alright | but how about some updates for the maps | My house is over 2 yrs old and my street doesn't even show up | When I called Mitsubishi about updates | they told me this summer w a cost of 100 are you serious | It will be a happy day when she is gone from my garage | 
 "words": I've owned this car a couple months and love it | Its 230hp keeps it as fast and fun as just about anything out there while the 4 door design maintains practicality for passengers and other daily uses | The shiftable automatic transmission is a joy when you want it to be | The AWD keeps the car stuck to the road | Standard technology includes bluetooth phone to make calls without taking your phone from your pocket and a FAST key remote sensor that enables you to unlock and start the car with the key in your pocket | The exterior styling is fantastic | 
 "words": After owning the vehicle for six months the paint in the rear quarter panels is chipping by the rear doors | I took this to the dealer and they nearly laughed at me | The service manager encouraged me to file a fraudulent insurance claim to so that they could get compensated and repaint the vehicle for me | Body shop people stated that this is a design flaw and a lot of Lancer's are having this problem | I was actually told to just budget for body work every year | Such a shame because I love the car otherwise | 
 "words": I bought my Lancer in July and like all of you was very excited about the look ride value and features | That is until I washed and waxed it after a few months | The paint on the rear side panels chips like you would not believe | I searched on the internet and found so many other Lancer owners that this is happening to as well | WHAT A BUMMER | If I would've known the condition that the paint would be in after only 6 months I wouldn't even have considered a Lancer | Oh yeah you guessed it | It is not a defect with the vehicle design or paint so it is not covered under warranty | Normal road wear | you've got to be kidding | 
 "words": This is the first Mitsubishi I have ever owned | So far after 1000 miles it drives pretty well | No problems yet | I am getting very good mileage | Up to 34 mpg on the highway | Rarely do I get less then 27 28 mpg anywhere | Smooth ride and not too noisy | Yes it's a bit underpowered but I can live with that for better mileage | Overall a nice car and fun to drive | The price was good too | 
 "words": We bought this GTS in Oct 08 from Northside Mitsubishi in Edmonton | The car looked great and seemed to be fairly tight | We were pretty excited being our first new car for my wife | at 4000km the rear main engine seal half way through a 1200km trip | The engine needed to be pulled and the seal replaced | Roadside assistance did nothing for us and we limped 600km to the dealership filling oil every 50km | At 6400 the transmission started packing it in and will be going in for replacement on April 13th 2009 | The company will do nothing for us other then repairing the major issues even when they struggle in today's market | Replacing the vehicle would be the solution which they declined | 
 "words": Well I have owned this car for six month's now and it's been pretty good although I have had some issues in which iv'e had to return to the dealer for | As with any car there are pro's and con's | However there are more pro's than con's with this lancer ES CVT | The pro's are great handling very sharp looking great mpg good power and a very quiet interior | I did have a few issues early on with the trunk light not working and the rear airbags cover came loose from the clips that held them in place | But those issues were fixed at the dealership | I traded in a 08 Honda Civic LX and I enjoy the Lancer much better | It handles better and looks better and is more quiet interior and has more power | 
 "words": I've had this car now for about 9 months and am very happy | Eye-catching exterior and the interior is nice | It runs great and I'm getting 30-35 mpg on the highway | The CVT takes getting used to and the engine is a bit loud | In normal city driving it feels as if the transmission is slipping but you eventually get used to the CVT | If you need to get up to speed fast the paddle shifters give you everything you need WHEN you need it | Sun and sound package is a GREAT upgrade | My biggest gripe is the rather large rear spoiler- it blocks your rear view quite a bit | Overall a very nice car at a good price | 
 "words": Car runs great | Should've gotten the GTS since it has more power than the ES- Sport but there is plenty of space between the engine and the firewall to add a few extra horses under the hood | 
 "words": I purchased this car thinking it would be reliable and would outlast all the American cars in the same price range | Well I have owned the car for about 4 months now and am not pleased at all | The car looks great gets good gas mileage but works when it wants to | This past month I have had to take the car back to the dealership for the same problem | The car doesn't want to run in the cold and the engine starts to act erratically | The service engine light comes on and the same code keeps coming up Torque Monitoring | The Dealership says they cannot fix my car and neither can Mitsubishi at the moment so I am left with a car that is brand new and won't run in the cold weather | LEMON LAW | 
 "words": I bought this car to escape the crazy gas prices a while back | This car is the best bang for the buck | I looked at a lot of cars in its class and none came close | most Civic Mazda3 etc | were more expensive with less options | You can't find a better car loaded with these options at this price | This car is much better looking too | looks like Bimmers Audis and Volvos in the 40- 50K range | Not thrilled with the performance from 0-30 after that it's great | I chose the CVT convenience over performance | 
 "words": I just bought this car and it's amazing | I got the Sun Sound package and it's worth every dollar | The performance is great for a 2 | 4l | I like the CVT with the paddle shifters | Fuel consumption it's good not the best one but it's good and better than my previous car | Hands free system works great | The exterior design is great it's an eye catcher | Handling and suspension work great together | 
 "words": I love the look of the car but the interior is very cheaply put together | The trunk area almost looks like it | s not finished from the factory | I live in Ohio and this is my first winter let's just say it's going to be a long five years with this car | It definitely needs traction control | I neglected to ask about that when I purchased the car needless to say had I known how poorly it would handle in the snow and ice would have never purchased it | 
 "words": When we first got the Lancer in mild weather it was fantastic we felt like we were driving a luxury car | We first noticed an issue with the radio speakers a few months ago | The radio didn't actually start to make noise until the dial was at 15 | Last week anytime anything other than talk radio the speakers are now crackling | Since winter started the rear door windows are taking FOREVER to defrost over an hour and interior parts are rattling locks on the doors back window silver stripe on the passenger door | We called the dealership and they told us there was nothing they could do about the rattling or the defrost issues as when it gets cold that's what happens | Nice response | 
 "words": This is one sweet ride for the price | I've had it a month it has never let me down even in the snow | The only option I added was Bluetooth which is something I will not live without in my next purchase | I've tested Mitsu power plants for the past 10 years in my 97 Neon my 98 Dodge Stratus both engines never let me down I have over 275000kms on the Stratus | I believe I'll get as much if not more mileage on my Lancer 
 "words": We've had our Lancer for six months | So far not one complaint | No problems of any kind and more importantly we love to drive | It's got a tight ride glued to the road takes a beating on terrible city roads is peppy and looks sexy | It has more than adequate power and with the kicking sound system it's more than fun to drive | I've bought 8 cars new since my 1982 driver's license and by far I'm happiest with this one the most | 
 "words": First off I bought this car back in may | I really liked zipping around in this little car during the summer but then winter has come along and I can honestly say that this is the worst vehicle I have driven in the snow | The car does have decent pickup but I think it could use a little more HP | If you live in a warm climate and want a fun little car to zip around in then this one is for you | My best mpg is 29 on the highway and I usually average around 17 in town | Seats are comfy but the ride can be rough at times also | Overall I would love to have this car in Florida or California just not in the Midwest | 
 "words": My previous car an '02 Hyundai Elantra broke down so I decided to trade it in | I had been researching new cars and had considered this as well as the Suzuki SX4 | Test drove my Lancer and I was hooked | I got the GTS with the standard stereo no nav | I kinda wished I had gotten it but I couldn't justify the extra cost | As far as the performance the car is quick and handles great | The tires seem to be the limiting factor | Everywhere I have looked people criticize the Dunlops for their lack of traction especially in the snow | The car is comfortable and drives great | The gas mileage is awesome | Its better than the mileage I would get in the Hyundai even though that engine was smaller | 
 "words": I just leased the 2009 Lancer GTS and looked at other compact but sporty vehicles in this class and I am sorry there is no comparison | The exterior and interior are A class and the other dealers do not have anything that comes close | This is a keeper | 
 "words": I love this car | It has good low end power and can get going when needed on the highway | The only thing I would change is to add traction control for the snow | One way you can get around this is to put the car into the shifting mode and when you push the gas shift up into third gear and it goes okay | 
 "words": I owned my car for about 24 hours and I know that's not quite long enough to know all the in and outs | But this thing is amazing | I driven an Evo and for the 10000 price cut this will not disappoint | One thing though good luck finding one | 
 "words": I got this last Nov and when I got it there is a small dent and the dealer was aware about it and verbally they told me that they will fix it and even give me a loaner car | Now they are giving me a hard time to have it fixed and the 6 CD is missing not even there | The specs on the paper 6CD MP3 is the deck w navigation | 
 "words": I think this is a fine buy for anyone looking at value | Mitsubishi has to be one of the most underrated automakers | The Lancer has great pickup good handling in the snow and a smooth ride all around | I looked around and did a lot of research on other cars in this class including some above and this won by a mile as far as price and value | Give it a drive and you will be convinced | 
 "words": I was driving Corolla 2007 | Also have driven civic | When I came here and saw the shape it was like love at first sight | However I must say it was the test drive and exterior shape due to which I bought this car | Fun to drive and very comfortable to sit in | 
 "words": I bought this car on Saturday and I absolutely love it | 
 "words": When I started looking for a new car I wasn't sure what I wanted | I drove the corolla the sentra and this little baby | I knew that I wanted a strippo to get the price down and I was blown away with this car | It's relatively quiet it has a fair amount of power and never feels slow on its feet | The thing that sold the car for me was the ride | It's never choppy and I could relate it more to a big car then anything else in its class | The clutch and the transmission is very smooth and easy to operate and to me feels like a manual transmission should | Being that I do live in the midwest I did have to pay the extra money for the A C which was well worth it | Give it shot | 
 "words": Bought my car a week ago and love it | Got the car with sun and sound along with navigation | I suggest that you get all these features | The touring package is probably a waste of 1000 bucks | Best handling car I've driven | Comfortable seats and great feel for fabric only interior |

 "words": I bought this 2009 Lancer GTS Automatic | First for what you are paying this car is truly incredible | I've research the others and read other reviews the reviews speak for this car | I traded my 06 corolla in for it and will never own another 'yota after this car | For approx | 17200 out the door I got this car loaded and for what I paid blows the competition out the door | I drove easy on my way home from the dealership and averaged 32 | 1 MPG going about 60-70 MPH not bad at all I drive easy however | All I can say is Mitsubishi awesome job | 
 "words": Well I went to the dealership to buy a Kia Sportage | Then I found out that it was too small and that I wanted something more sporty | I found the Mitsubishi lancer | And I loved driving for the first 5 miles then before I got back to the dealership I new that it was my own car already | Its a fast one with a lot of nice stuff | I got the sport package and the sun sound package with the bluetooth for only 19300 | I was looking at a Honda Civic coupe but the lancer is so much more worth it | And its a perfect size for a girl too | 
 "words": I have had it for about two weeks now | And this car is awesome | Turning is awesome get up and go is good | And don't forget all about the toys inside | Satellite radio is great | The nav is very accurate | All in all a great car inside and out |

 "words": I knew about the low armrest in center and on door | However I still loved the car | Nice sporty look and feel | The car drives great | The gas mileage could be slightly better but all is still good | The GTS vs the ES drive is night and day | The ES motor feels like it is winding up and going to snap the GTS sounds great while accelerating | If you get that sweet spot on where to rest your arm then you will enjoy the car | Knobs are well laid out | 
 "words": I didn't choose this car | this car chose me | after 2 minutes into the test drive the car was sold | it is extremely fun to drive with a tight turning circle and a performance tuned suspension | CVT transmission is great | very smooth | 2 | 4 liter sounds awesome and provides good acceleration | the car rides like a beemer | quiet in the city and on the highway with very little road engine or wind noise | I got it fully loaded with the nav 650 watt sound system FAST key stability control and HID auto headlights | gas mileage is not the greatest but the car makes up for it with how fun to drive it is | would recommend to any everybody | 
 "words": When I first test drove the car off the lot I was hooked | The car turns on a dime and has minimum body roll | The 2 | 4 L engine is a improvement from last year | The extra horsepower if perfect for the 4000 lb gross weight of the car | 
 "words": This was my first NEW car 7 miles at pick-up traded my Dodge Intrepid | I don't know how many times I've noticed people checking the car out even a stranger at the gas station who struck up a conversation with me about the car | It's an absolute dream to drive a ton of fun and so packed with technology that it's like driving INSIDE a computer sometimes | Highway MPG is very respectable city isn't the greatest but isn't that bad either | It's not a car to challenge other sport compacts to a race but if you're looking for a fun-to-drive car with enough get-up-and-go to get up and go this is worth adding to your short list | 
 "words": I just recently purchased a 2009 Lancer GTS loaded | It's great fun to drive extremely perky 5 speed | My only complaint is it doesn't have a leather option and the 5 speed could easily be converted into a 6 speed which would be a lot more efficient | The car is great the performance on it is extremely good for a 168 HP 4 cylinder beat my gf's 08 mustang it's automatic the fuel economy is far better than what it's rated at | I can draft behind a semi on the highway going about 60 and get up to 45 MPG instant icon read 50 once or twice but it overall is an extremely fun car to drive and I would recommend it to anyone | The car is a little heavy but it handles like a dream | No cheap feel either
 "words": This is my first brand new car I have ever had | I gave up my 2003 Pontiac Vibe for this wonderful car | I do work for carmax so I had a general idea of the competition for this car and I have to say that once I jumped in this car that I had no planned on buying I just bought it | What a great car | I'm very happy and I look forward to driving it everyday | It's quiet on the highway and seems to be pretty comfortable | My first tank of gas was 26 mpg driving in a mixed driving environment | I'm sure it will do 30 no problem on the highway | Great car if your looking for a new car under 15 | I'd rather have this than a civic or a corolla | 
 "words": The GTS is nicely equipped for a vehicle under 25k with nice pick up and go especially in the midrange rpm | The interior is fairly sleek with blue accent instrument panel | The 9 speaker Rockford stereo system definitely thumps with a 10 woofer in the trunk | The mileage is pretty good for highway driving | I've been averaging 28 mpg which is what i was getting on my ford focus but this car definitely has the fierce look to it | A real head turner | 
 "words": Mitsu could have made a winner with this lancer but have fallen short of the process | It has the looks the killer instinct and presence that tends to say get out of the way am going through | Has all the bark but lacks some bite | It's not as slow as some people tends to believe | If it want to go fast it certainly can | It lacks acceleration though | Highly recommended for freeway driving goes fast and gives decent MPG | Hate it on City driving horrible MPG | Don't get me wrong I love my car and I have it for 4 months now | Just wish Mitsu made it a little better
 "words": I can't believe that you can purchase a vehicle with all of these features for such a low price | Electronics are outstanding | 
 "words": I bought this car a few weeks ago and am loving it | It handles and looks like a much more expensive car | Everywhere i go i get looks and compliments | It's way faster than I expected for it only being a 4 banger | I'm not getting as good of fuel mileage as im supposed to but apparently this car slowly gets better mileage as it breaks in hope that's true |

 "words": I have owned the car for about a month now | I got the 5spd manual with the sun sound package and the navigation | I love the car so far | It has all the technology and features I wanted in a car | I was considering used BMWs audis acuras etc | but when it comes down to it this is a much more unique car and very fun to drive | I love that all the features and technology will last me at least 4 years of enjoyment while I drive the car too and from work | Some of those used BMWs didnt even have ipod hookups i can't deal with that lol | Anyways this is a sick car and is a blast to drive | Great warranty and overall good deal when you compare run of the mill cars like the civic and corolla

 "words": This car is great | I got mine fully loaded and I LOVE IT | Its spacious and has a great looking interior | 2 | 4L vice 2 | 0L engine definitely shows some gain but not enough for anyone that has an 08 to go out and trade theirs in for the 09 model | It drives fantastic all while not being to stiff over rough terrain | It really is a great balance between comfort and sharp maneuverability on the road | Navigation option really puts the icing on the cake with this car | Its navigation computer is so incredible I cant even believe it is on a car at this price range | All I can say it wow |
