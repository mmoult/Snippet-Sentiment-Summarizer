 "words": Purchased the car with Cash for Clunkers and got it for just under 10K | Considered Honda Toyota Mazda and Dodge but happy I settled with Elantra | Taken one long trip and averaged 36 mpg | The ride is quite and comfortable with an interior space that lets you hear music at a reasonable volume with a stereo system much better than what you would expect in this class | The seats are excellent for not being adjustable | I have a combat injury to my back and was quite surprised at the seat support comfort on a long trip | I have owned two Honda Civics and consider this vehicle a much better value especially when comparing the warranty coverage | Hyundai has come a long way baby | 
 "words": Excellent car | Thoughtfully engineered first-rate build quality very nicely equipped | But the warranty and the five years free roadside assistance closed the deal not to mention the great price | 
 "words": I have only had this vehicle since end of July 2009 and must say that I am quite happy with it so far | It is the GL w the sport packagerear spoiler 16 alum | wheels fog lights and skirt package | It really makes the car stand out beside a regular elantra | My only complaint is the rear trunk lid has developed a very annoying rattle dealer says it may be the spare tire tools and jack | Otherwise it is a great little car | Great on gas fit and finish is good and it handles quite nicely | Anyone considering a Toyota Corola or Honda Civic should look at this vehicle before they buy | 
 "words": Was going to buy a Corolla on the C4C program but a friend who works at CarMax recommended I give Hyundai a look | With the C4C the 2K mfg incentive and some negotiating was out for under 14G incl tax | Very comfortable smooth and quiet ride for a compact
 "words": Had the car for 3 weeks now and am pleased with it | I never considered buying a Elantra but friends of ours has 2 and love them | I wanted a car that's reliable safe good mpgcomfortable and affordable-the Elantra was it | No other car maker came close with the same options price plus warranty | It's not sporty or a head turnerbut for me that's ok | 
 "words": My wife and I purchased the Elantra out of desperation because it was the last day of the Clunkers program most dealers in our area had already stopped accepting trade-ins and our 89 BMW 735i was falling apart We test drove the Jetta Civic Sentra and Corolla but purchased the Elantra blindly because we really had no other choice as all dealer's inventories were fully depleted | WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE THE ELANTRA HAS BEEN | The car is solid | The ride instrumentation handling braking feel etc | are all terrific | I had and image in my mind of Hyundai's being cheap and raggedy boy was I wrong | We live Chicago the Pothole Capital of the World and this car easily holds it's own | 
 "words": This is yet another happy Cash For Clunkers story | My trusty '06 Accord lease was ending and I happen to have an F-150 I was holding on to | I got an early '09 no USB just AUX with BlueTooth option and walked out the door paying just under 10500 TOTAL taxes included | The great deals are available because even though this car is highly rated Hyundai's are just not coveted like Honda and Toyota are yet | Build quality is excellent and interior is nicely laid out | I got the manual which is similar to German gear layouts with a unique reverse lock-out feature as well | 
 "words": We really enjoy driving our GLS with sunroof and XM | Smooth quiet and refined | Seats are firm but comfortable | Dash is attractive and well laid out | Controls are easy to use | Sound system excellent | Peppy engine growls only when pushed but this car is more of easy going car than a sports machine | Price was certainly right considering quality included features and the warranty | Notice there are some exceptions in the fine print on the 60K 5 year guarantee | Cash for clunkers really sealed the deal for us | Looking forward to many years of service | 
 "words": The dealer was wonderful | Got a very good price for the vehicle | The vehicle it self is excellent for me a single male living on my own | It gets around town very well the freeway drive is comfortable | The audio sounds good and AC cools well | The steering wheel is a little touchy but that could be me who use to own a 96 Mercury | The brakes are great and the layout of the interior is excellent | Overall this vehicle was the best value out there | Hyundai has awesome rebates check your local dealer | Going one on one with Honda this car offers the same as a honda that cost 1500-2000 more | 
 "words": After visiting local dealerships-who quoted sticker prices only-less trade or rebate | Sought an out of state dealer who quoted in writing exact price Edmunds said you should pay-saved 5000- persistence pays | Considered Honda Fit and Civic and Nissan Sentra but Hyundai was much less with more features and much better warranty | Have not had a sedan in awhile-fairly fun to drive | Great mileage so far running 34 average with mostly city | 
 "words": I give high rating because I only compare this to other makes in the same class meaning hyundai can still build a better Elantra | 7 for Build Quality is because a window came off from its track only 2 weeks after I got it | Otherwise it would be a 9 | Very roomy for a small car pickup is good seat is comfortable | Everything just looks right and better when comparing to civic corolla or sentra | Like my friend says it looks more expensive than its price | They say tinted windows on the website but can't see how it was tinted | 
 "words": Had the car now for two weeks and am very happy | Traded my clunker for 4500 plus the 2000 discount then showed the dealer my TMV report bottom line is I got a great car at a great price | The car accelerates and brakes well and the handling is very good with little body roll in corners | The car is a bit noisy under heavy acceleration but quite under normal conditions | I have not noticed wind noise at highway speed | Overall the can is nimble fun to drive and fits four very comfortably | Gas mileage is good but I haven't had it long enough to really determine true MPG for me | Finally you can't beat the warranty | 
 "words": Bought the Elantra SE because I had a budget and needed to stick to it | Requirements were good gas mileage antilock brakes airbags and traction stability control | Comparable Civic and Corolla were 4K and 5K more even with cash for clunkers | Took the vehicle on an 1152 mile jaunt to Bar Harbor and back and averaged 31 | 2 mpg in all types of driving | Plus I crammed 3 young kids and the wife in the car and a weeks worth of clothes and supplies | The Elantra performed admirably | Not extremely exciting but a steady performer fit and finish was perfect seats were comfortable and ride was smooth | The engine was a little course when acceleration was needed but overall a great car | 
 "words": I was forced to buy another Elantra after hydro-planing mine into the guardrail on I-70 at 60mph | My 2004 absorbed the accident perfectly and I was thrilled how it did | So I went to Hyundai and they have improved everything on this newer model and after 700 miles I love the new car
 "words": I traded in a 2002 Honda CR-V for a 2009 Hyunda Elantra GLS | While I loved my Honda I was ready for something different | I checked out Toyota Honda Nissan and Kia and at the end my decision was easy- I got the most BANG for my buck with the Hyundai Elantra | It has a great stereo system love having an aux cable to listen to my MP-3 player with blue tooth speaker system for calls a lovely blue backlit system that people rave about every time they are in my car and a ton of trunk space | It also looks great from the outside | It is fun to drive spacious more comfortable than my moms Acura MDX and reliable | W an amazing price and reliability it is a keeper | 
 "words": Its not as sporty as a Mazda 3 nor as popular not yet as Corolla or Civic but my Elantra gets the job done with far more than enough safety and luxury features as standard | MPG 33 on highway 65 MPH | Although it could use more hp ride is quiet pleasing and comfortable on long drives | Build and qualities are up par with the famous 3 | Bottom line is the price I paid for this great car | sure saved me a lot to afford to go on long drives for vacations | 
 "words": I purchased a new 2009 Elantra SE and I absolutely love it | The more I drive it the more I enjoy it | The 16 Alloy wheels with the Hankook performance tires make the handling awesome to drive | I chose the metallic pearl grey with the rear spoiler and it looks great | I have previously owned two new BMW 3 series and I in no way feel like I am driving a poor cousin of the BMW | I am in no way saying this car is as good as the 3 series but for the money WARRANTY and performance you cannot go wrong with the Elantra | The economy has changed my purchasing power right now and I am so glad I made the Elantra my choice | Cash for Clunkers Rocks | 
 "words": We live in a very hilly region of Western New York State | Economy cars we have owned would always struggle on the hills | The air conditioner would need to be turned off | The Elantra moves smartly up the hills without a struggle and we remain cool | A test drive with the Toyota Corrola showed a lack of power the Honda Civic on hills was ok but the dash arrangement was a bit too hokey and the cabin cramped | The Elantra | s clean no- gimmick controls and dash were much more user friendly than the competition | The handling of the Elantra is crisp and the SE's ESC has allowed me to avoid a collision with a deer while moving 55-60 mph | Any other non-ESC car would have been in the collision shop | 
 "words": I bought this under the CARS program and am getting 10 mpg better than my Explorer | The car feels solid and drives great | Still getting used to 4 cylinders but small price to pay for better gas mileage | Would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": Fairly satisfied with the purchase | Under 17K for SE with ESC monroof and heated seats | Comparably equipped Civic was about 4K more | Front interior space is hindered by curve of dash | Late 09 models removed the Coolant temp and made the gas gauge as big as the Tach | Ridiculous | Can get 25 mpg in 100 city driving and 31 on the highway | 
 "words": Sure its not as sporty as Mazda3 nor as popular as Civic or Corolla watch it though but my Elantra gets the job done of driving to work and home along I80 just fine with enough bells and whistles especially safety features as standard equipment | Not to mention its superb warranty | MPG 34 on the highway cruising speed | Most of all the big savings at the dealership | 
 "words": bought a elanta gls auto | went from a Mustang GT | which was fully loaded | Overall very suprised was expecting a slow sluggish car nice handling and decently comfortable | Gas milage is outstanding getting 37mpg without the car being broken in yet | Braking response is great only complaints high engine rpms at 70 almost 3k rpm on expressway steering is heavy compared to every other vehicle I have drivin | Can't beat the warranty and with cash for clunkers final price 9800 for a car with an invoice price of 18K | Will write a new review when I have more miles on my car | Only have 200 at this time | 
 "words": I love this car | I traded a Jeep Grand Cherokee and space is not an issue | It is spacious despite it's small footprint | I got the optional moonroof and heated front seats | I was looking at a Civic Corolla and Jetta | This had standard features that the others didn't have or were optional | The warranty is the best | If you buy this car before the 1 | 49 gas price guarantee expires don't get it | It is a huge rip-off | Take the 2000 cash back instead | I would have never looked at Hyundai a few years ago but their cars are now as good as or better than their Japanese and German competitors | Pay the extra few grand for the SE to get the safety features | 
 "words": I sold my 2006 Hyundai Sonata to a friend and decided to give the Elantra a try | I purchased in mid June 09 and after 6 weeks and 1100 miles I thought it time to do a review | The car is very quiet and comparable to my 2006 Sonata in road noise | I average about 30 to 31 mpg with about 60 40 Highway to city driving ratio | The handling and responsiveness is very good and what I expected | The car is very fun to drive and while it does not have the 6 cylinder engine of the Sonata I am more than satisfied with the acceleration | I drive mostly in the Urban Dallas Ft Worth area during nonrush hour times | I have not taken it on a road trip yet | It is early for my assessment but I am satisfied
 "words": My wife and I test drove pretty much every competitive small sedan | We finally came between the Kia Forte EX and the Elantra SE and went with the car we could get at the lowest price | They are identical in all features but the Hyundai has larger alloy wheels and thus has a smoother ride | We purchased a black pearl SE manual with bluetooth and paid 14100 walk out not including cash for clunkers | Couldn't get Kia to get anywhere close | The Elantra SE is a perfect fit for us and has every feature we wanted | Bluetooth cruise steering wheel audio controls sporty exterior etc | For the price nothing can beat it | 1 small sedan according to Consumer Report new car guide and it shows | 
 "words": Open your mind and make sure you test drive a new Elantra if you are in the market for a compact car like me you may be pleasantly surprised at what you find | AMAZING value | Lots of room in the quiet comfortable well thought out interior | Predictable handling confident braking and more than adequate power and torque with the automatic | Unlike almost every other car I've purchased my Elantra is rock solid and doesn't have a single buzz rattle or assembly flaw | I came close to buying a Honda Fit before I decided to check out the Elantra and I'm so glad I did | this car is a keeper |

 "words": I purchased the top of the line Elantra in Canada-limited edition because of the ESC feature- but decided that the leather seats and sunroof and automatic climate control might be nice to have | I have thoroughly enjoyed the car so far- it drives beautifully and quietly and is responsive and roomy and very comfortable for driver and front seat passenger- no experience yet with someone in the back seat | The interior finish is first class and the layout of the dashboard and all features are consistent with a much higher priced vehicle | I checked out the competition- Corolla Civic Mazda3 Ford Focus and found the Elantra a better deal for the money and the 5 year 100000 warranty is a plus | 
 "words": This vehicle is 100 solid | I have owned Toyota Honda Chevy and Saturn | This vehicle is just as solid and well built if not better built than all other vehicles on the road | INCLUDING HONDA OR TOYOTA | Yes believe it or not | And there warranty program is the BEST in the nation | THIS IS A WONDERFUL VEHICLE
 "words": I love the Hyundai Elantra | It's very quiet compared to most small cars | I tested a Toyota Corolla and it was miserably loud and I would never ever get one of those now | I hate when small cars just because they're small and economy based they are loud in the cabin interior | The Elantra really stands out because the cabin is so nice and quiet | I was going 55mph and there was no road or wind noise | The only time it gets a little loud is when you're really stepping on the gas but that's because it's a 4cyl | I'm quite happy with how quiet the car is

 "words": Really enjoy the Elantra and it is a much better value than the overpriced Corolla or Civic | The SE comes with almost everything you could ask for while on the Toyota or Civic so much is optional | When you add the options that the Elantra has standard the price easily exceeds 20k | As for the comments about the wheel wells and mud guards | Well the Elantra is not a 4X4 all terrain vehicle | If you want a car for gravel and other off pavement environments you should have gotten the Santa Fe |

 "words": After only 3 weeks and 300 km of winter grid road travel all 4 wheelwells and all 4 mudguards are damaged | 1 mudguard has a 4 diameter hole clear through it | I am fortunate enough that my dealer is replacing all 44 free of charge in addition to coating them with a rubber compound calling it a Goodwill repair | For your information the temperature has been -30C | My maximum grid road speed was always less than 100 km hr | The odd thing is there is basically NO gravel left on the road since it's not graded in the winter | currently the maximum particle size is only 5mm |

 "words": I am a loyal Honda Civic owner and my wife is a loyal Toyota Camry Corolla owner | So we are still in shock when we are shopping for a replacement car this past month we decided on the 2009 Hyundai Elantra SE | What made us make this decision | For me it's not really hard to make after a comparison of features and pricing | It's really disappointing how much Civic Corolla has really jack up their prices now you're paying more for the brand name then actual product | The Elantra by comparison no longer just offers a cheap car at a cheap price but it's a great car by comparison at an incredible price | Anybody looking to buy Civic Corolla should definitely give Elantra a hard look |
