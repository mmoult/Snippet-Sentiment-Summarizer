REVIEWS
 "words": I wanted to downsize from my 2003 Chevy Blazer 4x4 and found an incredible deal at one of the Chrysler dealerships that was losing its franchise | I liked the funky crossover design and decided to test drive it on a whim | More than 4 months later I still enjoy this vehicle as much as the day I took that test drive | So far this is a great little car | My gas mileage is around 28 and I've got the automatic tranny | The interior is very user friendly and the seats are firm and comfortable | This thing is agile | handling is great | Engine performance is more than adequate | Overall I'm very impressed with this Compass | Also I get a lot of compliments on this vehicle | 
 "words": Just bought my new 2009 Jeep Compass with touch screen radio 3 days ago | Overall this vehicle is wonderful with some exceptions | The touch screen radio is not working | All other touch screen components are fine but radio is very temperamental | Compartments in console are very tiny and are too small to really put anything in them | Cup holders a bit hard to get at however love the optical interior improvements from the 2007 compass that I rented last year but is this electrical problem a sign of things to come | 
 "words": I Shopped until I Dropped | I found problems relating to all SUV's and what sold me on the Jeep Compass was the price and the lifetime powertrain limited warranty | MSRP 19450 | 00 Minus 4500 cash for clunkers Minus 3500 Chrysler rebate | Minus 2500 cash back from my dealer | A very nice SUV for around 10000 | 00 that rides well easy to park and is fun to drive | 
 "words": don't know why the experts don' t like this car its fund to drive and gets great mileage | I got the 5-speed with front drive not 4x4 and get over 30 mpg with town highway driving | Its a steal of a deal too | Very sporty driver | 
 "words": We tried to buy a Patriot during cash for clunkers but couldn't find one with 4wd anywhere in the country so got the Compass instead | BIG mistake | I have to put a cushion on the seat because it is too narrow for my wide load and the seat belt digs into my right thigh when driving | The rear-view mirror gives a tiny view through the small back window but worst of all I can't change lanes because the high seat backs in the back row completely block my view of the next lane | Dangerous | Handling is fine looks are great and fuel is okay | I'm getting about 24 on mostly highway | I just don't think I can stand the discomfort so I'm considering selling or trading this in now | 
 "words": I purchased this car after driving an Acura MDX for 4 years | At first I was concerned about the big change going from a higher end SUV to a much smaller and cheaper crossover | However I just love the way this car drives | Because the car is so much lighter than my old SUV the smaller motor fits the vehicle just fine | The CVT works well | I'm still breaking the motor in but am averaging around 27mpg | The uconnect DVD navigation with hard drive and satellite radio is really nice | It took a little while to get used to the Rallye wheels but now I really like them | Overall I'm very happy with this car | 
 "words": i have an 07 patriot ltd and i luv it but this compass ltd is so much more fun to drive | i luv its looks and the ltd package with silver bumper accents silver body side moldings and chrome wheels turn other drivers and pedestrians heads | under load it seems a little sluggish but the more i drive it the more accustomed to it i become | comfort is as good or better than the patriot | fuel economy is very good too | the interior is better than most same class competitors | all seams are tight and well-aligned doors fit tight etc | 
 "words": I never thought I would buy American again after a wonderful run with my 95' Toyota Corolla with over 200000 on it and still running strong | i needed a stronger motor to pull a motorcycle trailer and I test drove a X-3 BMW and a honda C-RV and this Compass blew them both away | The most outstanding thing about this vehicle is the way it handles | IT handles like a sports car | No Kidding | Tight package | Comfortable seats | and an EXTREMELY quiet ride even at 70-80mph | I also work on my own cars and plugs and oil must be easy for me to get to and this engine is laid out simply and very clean design | Pulls my trailer with my 650 dirt bike with ease | FANTASTIC
 "words": This is a great small SUV | I have repeatedly driven a 07 Ford Escape and a 06 Toyota Highlander and the Compass is a lot more fun to drive | It's not exceptionally quick or powerful my previous vehicle was a Dodge Ram with a 5 | 7L Hemi but the car-like handling makes up for it | Also the fuel efficiency seems to be better than the 25mpg stated | I have worked it out to be roughly 30mpg city and 40mpg highway | It felt a little sluggish when I first started driving it but when I became more familiar with the CVT nuances I feel the performance has increased | The interior is more than competent and rather comfortable even considering my 6'6 frame | Also the entertainment options are a plus | 
 "words": As follows are the assessments after 60 days for Compass sport 5spd 4x4 north Average fuel mileage without Air cond running 28mpg 80 highway at 74mph 20 city | 5 speed tranny good but requires work for reverse with clutch | Engine good and quiet no rattles or noises no false starts | No faults detected interior build better than other models such as 08 Liberty | Great ride handling good sound insulation | Tested 4x4 on muddy access trail no undercarriage hits good ground clearance for model | All in all a very good purchase for the dollar and only real 4x4 offered with 5spd in this price range | Easy to reach zones for cleaning since my co-pilots are my pets | 
 "words": The 2009 Jeep Compass has been the best vehicle I have purchased so far | I have no regrets whatsoever | Great fuel mileage comfortable easy to clean roomy quiet great interior and exterior look | The new lifetime warranty is the best | 
 "words": This vehicle is good on gas has lots of room in side for the size of it and good on long trips | I am very satisfied with this car | 
 "words": Before purchasing a 09 Compass I read a lot of reviews for the 08 | I AM GLAD THAT I DID NOT RELY ON THOSE REVIEWS | Complaints lodged against the 08 Compass have been rectified in 09 the interior has been redesigned and looks great the additional noise dampening makes the vehicle ride quietly and the transmission is smooth | This thing is fun to drive and has a lot of pickup for a 4 cyl | engine | I was looking for a 6 cyl | vehicle but this one won me over after a test drive | Fuel economy is good and the price is fantastic | I personally love the look of the vehicle-as long as it is red blue or orange-the other colors make the vehicle look long my opinion | I give it a solid 9-test drive one | 
 "words": I waited for the 2009 and the new interior is great | The manual transmission is the way to go I drove a CVT version as a rental and I did not like it | Love the Rally E package and the upgraded sound system is clearer and sharper than my old Rockford Fosgate Mitsubishi stereo | Without the downshift of the manual long hills would be a problem | Other than hills overall pick-up is fine | I commute daily and the Compass is great in snowy icy conditions | I am very very pleased with my Compass | You really get alot for your money |
