 "words": I purchased an 09 Premium Plus and found the seats to be super uncomfortable | So uncomfortable in fact that I ended up trading it in with only 4000 miles on it for another '09 A4 but this one had the sport seats M3-style retractable thigh support bolstersand better shoulder support plus paddle shifters | Night and day | While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16000 miles in my Sport package model | The only issue is that from what I understand Audi has discontinued the Sport Package and now only offers the better seats in the S4 | Something to consider- you will not like the stock seats if you are 5'10 | 
 "words": I've had this car for almost a month with 1300 miles on it | It is an awesome car with excellent driving dynamics | I can hardly believe it is a 4 cylinder but I'm reminded of it when I idle the engine with the windows down | I returned a leased 2007 Lexus IS350 and at no point did I feel like I downgraded although this vehicle was 7000 less | The interior room is cavernous and the ergonomics are superb | Acceleration is amazing for any size engine not to mention for a 4 cyl | The Bluetooth integration is excellent as it reads your entire phonebook and makes accessible at your steering wheel controls | The front end with the LED Running lights makes this car spell luxury | 
 "words": I traded in my 2002 A4 3 | 0 Quattro on a lease on a 2009 A4 2 | 0 Quattro | This 2 | 0 has plenty of torque | Cannot tell the difference with the new V4 from my prior V6 except the gas mileage is better and it is a quieter engine | I ordered the Premium Plus package with the navigator | I love the voice activated bluetooth dialing the voice activated navigation etc | and the backup camera with guidance | Audi came up with a winner | I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city suburbs | I am very happy with the vehicle | I loved my 2002 | but this is a big improvement | Only thing I miss from the 2002 is the storage compartments under the front seats | 
 "words": We get many compliments on our S-Line Cab | Great looking S4 wheels | This is our first convertible and we love top down driving | The Cab is fun to drive but not BMW thrilling | Like the fact its an AWD car for full year use | Fit and finish is excellent interior is gorgeous | Gas mileage is terrible | Hope long term reliability is good | We leased but buyout is very attractive | If it holds together can envision a long term ownership | 
 "words": Fun to drive in country roads especially with S mode | The exterior with daylight running light draws attentions and the interior design especially with the red back lights is just beautiful | The fuel economy is good with over 33 mpg highway and 27 mixed highway city driving | 
 "words": Quite frankly it's hard to be ambivalent about 40k purchase but I have to be honest with myself and 9 months after purchasing this car I can't say it's changed our lives | It's solidly built but there's a fair amount of road noise | For all the self- congratulation from Audi about the increase in size it's really not all that roomy | I think my wife's old 2001 Jetta had more room in the back | The MMI might be good compared to options from other manufacturers but it's hardly intuitive | In sum it's a solid but not outstanding effort | 
 "words": The performance is great with sports mode but the suspension is a bit bumpy for my taste I can feel every road bump but I guess that's what you get for a more sports tuned suspension | Fuel economy is not bad for a 211hp AWD car | I'm getting about 30 mpg on the highway and average about 25 highway city driving | It is definitely a fun to drive car with very tight turning circle | Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends | The problem is I'm getting the shimmy around 62 mph hence points off in reliability and the diagnosis from Audi Engineering is bad control arms | I'm keeping my fingers crossed that replacing control arms will cure the shimmies | 
 "words": I've had the Audi for 2500km so far | It is amazing | Fuel efficiency is great for a car with this much power | The 2 | 0 is more powerful than the 3 | 2 for the first 100km 60mph | I have the navi and tech pkg | Everything is voice activated | Back up camera is very handy | Proximity sensor locks and engine start are very convenient | EPS is nicely engineered | Audi side assist is handy | Seats are very comfortable | Breaks are high performance | I tested the Lexus IS250 and the BMW 328xi also | I have heard Hey man nice car | from over 10 people in 3 weeks | So that covers the exterior design | Red Bull must be more popular in Germany than North America one of the cup holders is small | 
 "words": Turbo 4 provides plenty acceleration with good gas mileage | Handling is unreal | Considered the BMW 328 and Cadillac CTS | Both were great but did not appear worth the extra cost insurance maintenance and purchase price | 
 "words": Car is everything I expected | Fit Finish is as good as it gets | So good in fact that the seams trunk to body are so tight you can't fit bike rack clips in between | Engine is smooth | Test drove the 2 | 0s not going to pay this much for a car that vibrates 3 | 2 is for me | Brakes are awesome | Keep your eye on the rear view in a panic stop | Tiptronic is fun | Quirks | The ipod interface is poor I leave my keys in the car in the garage but not with this | the lights will not turn off the homelink does not work until you turn the car on | Kinda dumb that you start the car before you open the garage door | 
 "words": This by far has been the best experience in any of the cars I have driven | The car has a lot of speed for a 4 cyl and also it has a sport gear | The interior is really comfortable and I so far have not had any blind spots | Could not ask for more in a car | 
 "words": Purchased two days ago and drove over the weekend | Car is beautiful inside and out | Handles like a dream | Very comfortable | Virtually all functions are automated | Using the MMI takes some work but once you get the hang of the info entry process it works for most of the different functions | Several reviews stated that someone shorter than 5'4 might have some problems with the driver's seat position | My wife is 5'2 and had no problem getting into a comfortable driving position | Back seat has enough room and the trunk is large for this class of car | I would recommend test driving the 2 | 0T as is performs quite well | 
 "words": I've had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints except for the wind see below | The A4 drives well though it's not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series | Steering is tight brakes are just a bit grabby and power is strong | The AWD is the best especially in heavy slushy snow | The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open | Poor wind engineering | And it's difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn't make noise | Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level | 
 "words": I had the 06 A4 | The 09 model is much bigger for a tall guy like me a great improvement | The LED light and the media control really made my decision much easier we were choosing among Audi BMW MB and Volvo | Best value for its class | It has been a month since we got it we liked everything | 
 "words": Both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods | The problem is that the seat's side support bolsters are so high and firm firmer than all other luxury cars of the same class that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones | The outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by noT allowing any amount of downward give of the seat | Thus when exiting the vehicle the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs | 
 "words": I've had my Audi A4 for one week now | Excellent well designed car | Sharp styling with excellent design fit and finish on the interior | MMI is really slick | Performance on the 2 | 0T is excellent strong pull due to high torque | No problems with the CVT thus far | Exhaust note gives a good growl when accelerating | Pricing right now has been really good too | 
 "words": Just picked up an Aruba BluePremium Plus with Navi and wood trim | My wife has a 2009 Cab older platform for about a year now | I love driving it so much that I shopped the end of season sales for a sedan for me and found a great deal | I was driving an '04 Accord with 100k trouble-free miles and had no desire to give it up | The Audi's driving dynamics power and smoothness of the engine are great even vs | Cab and gas mileage is quite good | It's also the perfect size I was looking for | The gray interior is beautiful | The MMI is awesome as is the bluetooth and stereo | Seats very comfortable as well | If reliability is on par with the Honda this will be the best car I've ever owned | 
 "words": This car is simply stunning especially from the outside especially with the Prestige package I got | Handling is very balanced ride is sporty yet comfortable for longer commutes | Quattro provides excellent grip and 2 | 0T is powerful yet fuel efficient have gotten 35 mpg cruising | Plus this car is as big as the Passat I traded in | Some downsides include having to get Prestige to get those stunning 18 wheels and 4 cyl | a little course when revved hard | But overall I loved my choice for my first luxury brand car | 
 "words": This car was leased for my wife | I owned a TT with a manual transmission a few years ago and we were attracted to this car by the excellent lease terms appearance and the previous experience with Audi | The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks | The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver's window | That was fixed | The second trip was because the automatic transmission CVT feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds causing significant loss of power | This even happens in sport mode | In addition there is some lurching and hesitation upon initial acceleration | The dealer says this is normal | 
 "words": I've only owned my new car for about a month and a half almost 2 months now | The day after I bought it it had a check engine light on | 3 trips to the dealership in a month and a half later I got the fuel pump replaced | I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue because I really do love the car | I feel I should relate my experience to others so they can be informed buyers though | Aside from this inconvenience I really do like my car | 
 "words": Please Test Drive this car extensively | Dealer will NOT tell you that the car goes forward when you put car in reverse | They say this is normal for cvt transmission | This was not disclosed before purchase | I don't think they would ever sell any cars with cvt if this was disclosed | DO NOT BUY THIS CAR | 
 "words": Owned a 2004 C230 and moved on to Audi A4 cvt FWD | Like the styling and seating comfort | Speedometer is a little ridiculous for US driving | When sunroof is open sound is deafening but main issue is the acceleration lag when in D | Lessens somewhat when put in S mode | I use regular gas premium is recommended will try that next | 
 "words": This is my third A4 in four years passing them on to the kids or trade in on lease | The 2009 Prestige is one sweet machine | Better performance than than older 2006 and 2007 A4 with more torque and horsepower with highway mileage 33 mpg level road at 65-75 | Also looked at BMW with AWD but run flats and many thousands more just not worth the difference and I have had BMW 3 series in the past | Great cruiser at 90 mph and around town | It is bigger than older A4 as big as I can tolerate | 37900 with 0 | 9 and 1 k down a great deal than 4200 off MSRP I will buy it rather than lease | 
 "words": This is a great looking car and fun drive but has one major flaw | If you attempt to accelerate fast from a dead stop by mashing the accelerator the transmission hesitates for a full second before the turbo kicks in | This can be dangerous when attempting to make a left turn in front of approaching traffic | I was told by the dealer that this is a common complaint because of the tiptronic transmission and cannot be corrected | You simply cannot throttle the vehicle hard from a stop and there is no fix | They said that I would get used to it | Be sure to test drive the vehicle before purchasing | I only test drove mine for a few miles | 
 "words": The commute has gotten a lot more pleasant since the A4 S-Line came in | The Audi is quiet comfortable and effortlessly easy to drive | The Alcantara seats are cooler than full leather in hot Louisiana summers | MMI is easy to use and useful after very short learning curve | The steering wheel scroll buttons make dialing phone numbers radio surfing preset stations easy and safe | The daily commute is a 70 30 mix of highway 65-70 mphand stop-n-go traffic and the Audi delivers an amazing avg 28-31 mpg with mindful throttle depends on traffic weather | Despite the 19 wheels and summer perf | tires the ride is firm without being jarring test before buying | Gorgeous and feature laden | 
 "words": I was a previous MINI Cooper S owner and was looking for something else that was fun to drive | I spend about 2 hours of my day commuting and the Audi A4 Quattro 2 | 0 with the Premium Plus package fits what I need | It has fun and comfort | I'm a big tech geek and the A4 meets my needs | My favorite feature has to be the MMI | I had this car for almost 3 months and it has been excellent ever since except for a few strange rattle noises coming from the doors | It's a big head turner | so be prepared | I have had people in the freeway cruise up to me on the next lane just so they can turn their head to view the led lights | 
 "words": 09 A4 2 | 0T CVT Prem Plus Quartz Gray | Terrific styling with an equal balance of handling and performance to please the enthusiast | MPG safety features opts are solid only sedan w a D pillar | 2-Tone gray interior is best out of other sedans tested | Love the lane change tap w side mirror LED's | Multitronic CVT proves powerful mechanical and engine notes DFI techno make me smile | All around a spirited and sporty car | 
 "words": I am 600 miles into an Audi A4 Quattro and it is the worst car I have ever owned | The driver seat is so uncomfortable I can only sit in the car for no more than 45 min | All the dealer suggested is to get a pad | The ride is awful pebbles become large rocks rough roads rattle your teeth | I am missing my old Ford 500 more every day | If you are considering this car be wary take a long test drive | 
 "words": My car choices when searching came down to the BMW 335 sedan Lexus GS 350 and the Audi A4 | I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price | The A4 has the quattro AWD fold down rear seats 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system bluetooth and navigation | I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i | The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn't grow on me | So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision | The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode the handling is great with the quattro and it's very eye catching with the LED driving lights | 
 "words": This is my first entry level luxury sedan purchase | I'm very thorough in my research and compared BMW Lexus and Audi | Performance quality and style made Audi the best choice for me | 
 "words": I test drove the BMW 328i wagon Saab 9-3 Combi Prius Audi A3 Subaru Impreza VW GTI Volvo V50 and the Mazda 3 | The A4 Avant had the luxury speed room look and quality of materials I was looking for | I took my first maiden road trip and could not be happier | No body aches great gas mileage great handling in rain and when the sun came out I opened up the panoramic sun roof | 
 "words": I've driven everything in this segment from Lexus IS MBenz to BMW and this car is the best combination of Luxury Performance and comfort | I chose the Prem Plus Sport Pkg with 18s and 6spd Manual | Audi has completely raised the bar with this one | The sport pkg takes the handling threshold into triple digits with ease | Plus I've been getting 31 | 3 MPG cruising between 72- 80mph hwy which is unheard of | I had a 2007 Infiniti G35x and never got north of 19MPG | Just drive the A4 once and you'll understand completely | 
 "words": Our first experience with Audi came after my wife turned a triple 360 on a slick road in an Acura TL | For our next car purchase safety and engineering were at the top of the requirements list | After a 2002 A6 2002 TT Roadster and 2007 A4 we took possession of a 2009 A4 2 | 0T Quattro with Premier Plus option package | The improvements in the 2009 A4 are impressive and reflect Audi's continued excellence in engineering | This model with it's increased length and width adjustments to the engine mounts to reduce the vibration in the 2 | 0 four cylinder engine and the tweaks to the acceleration off the line make us feel like we're back in our A6 | Roomy feature rich rides on rails | 
 "words": I previously owned an 06 A4 with all bells and whistles in it and I loved the car | When it was up I got an 09 stick premium plus model with sport package and nav and the car is amazing | The sport suspension really gives the car that sporty feel and the summer tires make the car hug the road and handle amazing | This car also has more low end torque which works really well when getting onto highways | The 2006 model was more sporty but with the sport package it makes this car a great mix of sport and luxury | 
 "words": I purchased this car for the winter weather performance blend of fuel efficiency and power stunning appearance and advanced safety and technology features | Those the car achieves these easily | Living with the car for a while I would love to give it back | The primary drawback of the vehicle is the very rough ride over 50 MPH | The vehicle seems to transmit every nuance of the road surface into the cabin the seats and the floor | The suspension is just far far too firm | Riding on rougher roads is continuously distracting with tiny road imperfections intruding into an otherwise palatial experience | I urge anyone considering this vehicle to do an extended test drive | I wish I had | 
 "words": Great car to drive | Comfortable ride | I went from the 08 to the 09 and it definitely feels better although Audi could have kept the full size spare tire and the regular cup holder | Minor things when compared to such huge improvements | 
 "words": If you're the type of driver that wants to look forward to getting in your car this Audi fits the bill | Our A4 does not have the sport package so the steering and suspension is not as stiff responsive as let's say an S- line Audi but the ride is a smooth as can be which my wife prefers | This car is a real standout in the rain extremely stable which I attribute to the Quattro | Haven't driven it in the snow yet but I imagine it will perform well | The seats are comfortable and the steering wheel feels great on your hands | Plenty of trunk space | The bluetooth telephone is seamless hop in the car and the car takes the call | iPod attachment works great as well | Daytime running lights | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Audi to replace my 2002 A6 2 | 7T | I like the look of the A4 so chose the Avant version for practical reasons | I must say that it's such a joy to drive this car everyday that the commute to and from work seems almost tolerable | It feels sporty even without the sports package | Even though the sports package moves it further up the performance ladder the ride is a little too jarring for the road I drive on | An added bonus on this car is fuel frugality | I am already averaging 25 | 5 MPG over 1300 miles 1 5 city and 4 5 highway driving | 
 "words": After months of study and countless test drives I chose the Audi A4 quattro over the BMW 328xi and the new BMW 335d | As a previous BMW 3-series owner I agonized over the decision | However I cannot be happier | After owning it a few weeks it has exceeded my high expectations | It is truly an incredible vehicle with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for | After initially considering the base premium model with the add-ons I wanted I ultimately opted for the prestige model with all the toys | The icing on the cake is that I paid thousands less than a comparably equipped BMW with better mileage | 
 "words": I had previously owned an A4 2000 | I remembered the fun it brought so I thought I'd give it another chance when I began my car search | I also tried all the usual suspects | This was simply the best bang for the buck | I went with the Premium package with AWD | You don't need anything more than that | I read many reviews by other readers and I agree with the positive vibe on this newly improved model |

 "words": This is my first Audi purchase after many years of Volkswagen ownership and so far I am loving every mile of it | I chose the Premium Plus and 18 Sport packages | The seats are very comfortable and all controls are easy to use although I find using the MMI creates an extra step to do just about anything except adjust the radio volume | As typical for a German automobile everything is placed logically | The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them | I placed my order 10 08 and would have preferred a M T but the timing just wouldn't work for me to wait that long | Other than that I can't really complain | 
 "words": My trade was a 2006 A3 sport that I had for 2 | 5 years | I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive | The A4 Avant Sport was it | Options I got Premium Plus Sport Navigation Rear Side Airbags | This car is unbelievable | The BMW 325xi wagon cost 8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn't drive as well | The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great | However I'm not going to apologize to my back seat passengers as they trip getting out of the car small back seat and door opening if I'm buying a 44k car and I would have to do that with the EX | 
 "words": Living in the Snowbelt had a dilemma which car to pick | I was looking for manual and 4 wheel drive turned out that there are not many options available | The instance when I sit- down into Audi realized that I like this car after the test drive I felt in love with it | signed the contract hour later | If you are looking for great looking comfortable car which can pump the blood through your veins go with A4 manual | BEST CAR on the market |

 "words": Previously owned two 6-cylinder Jaguar X-Types | The Audi A4 ride is fantastic | the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful | Tiptronic manual shift is fun but dangerous must be careful to avoid speeding ticket | This vehicle is beautiful roomy and hugs the road | Because it's low to the ground you have to be careful when parking so the front end isn't damaged by concrete barriers | 
 "words": Looked at the Infiniti G37 and BMW 3 series before settling on the Audi A4 | Owned an A6 over 10 years ago and wasn't sure if we we'd buy another Audi but the A4 has bested all my expectations in the little time I've had it | Didn't need AWD as we have a SUV at home so I got the FWD with Sport package in Premium Plus trim | Car drives beautifully hugs the road esp on turns sounds great and the LEDs turn heads for sure | The MMI is very easy to learn and the AMI and Bluetooth work like a breeze | The extended length also comes in handy | The next few years will tell me how much they've improved the Reliability but so far so good |

 "words": I am a 7-time BMW owner and was hesitant to compare the new Audi A4 to a 2009 BMW 3 series but was surprisingly pleased with the build quality performance and amenities you get in the Premium Plus package and decided to go with a new 2009 A4 vs the BMW 328xi | I have only owned my new Audi A4 for a few days now but am very pleased with the build quality ride and performance of this car | Anyone is the premium sport sedan market should take a serious look at the A4 before making a decision |

 "words": I swapped a Tundra pickup for this wagon and love the car | Best combination of size performance and practicality on the market | Wonderful handling and when the turbo kicks in breathtaking acceleration | Lots of features and techno gadgets even in the base model | As can be expected from Audi top notch interior build although the gray metallic plastic around the instrument panel seems cheesy why didn't they just use the aluminum trim like in the rest of the car | The radio controls take some getting used to and the steering wheel audio controls frustratingly don't let you scroll among preset stations only | This car is a looker and gets lots of attention a top choice among wagons | 
 "words": Original post- 09 28 08 Car remains a blast to drive- stereo remains a favorite bi-xenon lights are worth extra money | Significant difference in driving in S mode and super fun on twisting roads | Car handles fantastic in winter installed winter tires with all wheel drive go anywhere as along as snow drifts aren't too high Car is low watch out for curbs cement stops in parking places | Overall am very pleased with purchase after 4 1 2 months driving you still want to go out just for the heck of it | What could be better more horsepower | ride over bumps could be a bit smoother but then you'd lose the sports car feel | Just a great car |

 "words": I love this car and it has been great | At 1200 miles it feels like a dream to drive | no issues | I get plenty of compliments and makes me feel happy to drive it | The engine has good giddy up in the low-speed range | Once you're higher up engine feels like it struggles to move up nevertheless it's fast enough for me unless you're looking for a speeding ticket | 
 "words": Went from an '06 A4 2 | 0 Quattro to this | This is the '06 all grown up | The ride is tremendous and smooth | Very quiet in the cab which is great for blue-tooth calls | Handling is superb | Handles even better over 90 as all German cars should | Excellent off the line | Sport mode is stellar with the v6 | Light package makes you feel like a rock star as you turn heads | 
 "words": In January I traded in my 2006 BMW 530i in for the 2009 Audi A4 | It seems like it should compete with the 5 because of its roominess and standard features | This car is the perfect size and it's more fun to drive than my BMW | Great value | I love my Audi | 
 "words": I love the car it is quiet low road noise | But it burns oil | At 600 miles I have had to put in a half quart already | Furthermore you would think for a car that burns so much oil it would come with a dipstick but it does not | I wish I would have researched problems like this before buying | I do regret my decision now oh and for Audi the current oil consumption is within their limits so I drive with oil in my trunk at all times | 
 "words": In the three years leading up to this car I drove a Saab 9-3 | And I admittedly enjoyed the car | But after driving the Audi A4 I can't imagine ever going back to another manufacturer | The handling is tight the speed is quick and the ride is firm without being hard | 
 "words": Love this car | It's fun to drive and has character | It may not be the fastest in its class but it is fast enough | The interior design is excellent and the interior space is much more roomier than the older A4s | Personally I think the exterior design is nicer than the 3 series and C class | 
 "words": After two Corvettes I decided I needed something more practical but still fun to drive | The Infiniti G37X was a little too small and too stiff and the 328xi a little too expensive | The A4 was just right | It handles well and accelerates nicely with the turbo 4 | I don't think the V6 adds much more | It holds 4 people comfortably | I wouldn't go for 5 unless 3 are very small | The trunk is huge | The interior is handsome and the sound system is fine | This is my first experience with BlueTooth and its much better than OnStar |
