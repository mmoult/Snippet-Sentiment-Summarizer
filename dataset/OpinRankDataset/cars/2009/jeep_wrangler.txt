 "words": Know what you want | Everything in Edmunds' review is true and is what I like about the Wrangler | I've only had my X model about three weeks and haven't had it off-road but it turns heads handles well and fellow Wrangler drivers wave at you no small feat when living in a city and you wave back | If you want a sturdy truck- like vehicle you'll love it | If you want an SUV that rides like a car get a Cherokee | A Wrangler is what it is the soft-top is noisy no surprise | The interior is basic well duh but it's more comfortable than the wife expected | And if my 53-year-old wife oops can get in and out of the back of the two-door so can you | Research and drive one before you buy | 
 "words": My first Jeep was a liberty 06 | I just recently purchased an 09 2 Door Wrangler | First let me say I'm a college student so I don't mind a little bit of ruggedness | I drive up to Phoenix from Tucson 160 mile drive three times a month and I have to say I don't mind driving on the high way at all | I have a hard top | Ive dricing with no top but I find best is to drive with only the two front panels on | MPG are best at around 65mp I've seen around 23 24 mpg | But I usually do about 80mph so I avg like 18mpg | Around town I've seen 13 I know | I haven't taken it off roading yet but it is such a fun car to drive and ride around in especially if you live in a nice place like Arizona |

 "words": I bought this Jeep about 2 weeks ago and I love it | It handles great on and off road and the soft top is much quieter than I expected | My wife and I hit some trails this past weekend and this thing is unstoppable | We covered lots of mud and rocks and it never even slipped | My only complaint so far is the operation of the soft top | It comes off fairly easily but getting it back up was tough though not as bad as I have heard some say | Bottom line the Wrangler jk is awesome | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Wrangler YJ TJ and now the JK | The completely redesigned JK is noticeably larger with a better ride and more spacious interior | The straight-six 4L engine has given way to the venerable 3 | 8L minivan engine which has more horsepower but less torque | The gas tank has been moved forward to improve the angle of departure | The soft top can now open partially and the 3-piece hard top option makes for easier removal | Sound system is improved with larger speakers and dash-mounted tweeters with Sirius satellite as an option | Tow hooks and fog lamps are now standard equipment | Vehicle feels larger and sits higher | Outstanding off-road |

 "words": I have owned two other wranglers in the past the latest being an '01 | This one blows the other away | The exterior as always is beautifully designed | The interior has more leg and hip room than the previous generation and the soft top is remarkably quiet | I just took this on a 150 mile mostly highway trip in some nasty windand wind noise wasn't that bad at all | It did sway a bit in high winds but that is to be expected |
