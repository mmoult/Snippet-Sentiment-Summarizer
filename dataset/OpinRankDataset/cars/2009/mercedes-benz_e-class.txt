REVIEWS
 "words": I bought the E320 through USAA buying service through a professionally run dealership-American Service Center- Alexandria VA | I impressed by the cars looks engineering fuel economy and the torque of the turbo-diesel it gets up and goes | The quality of the car and its materials are evident | While the controls are well-place and intuitive this is not the case in the Command NAV interface | In particular the voice commands do not measure up to the technology in less expensive Japanese and Korean cars | The USAA buying service combined with Mercedes incentives made the car more affordable- -a once in a life time purchase maybe not | I love this car | 
 "words": I bought a new 2009 E350 due to the massive incentives both dealer and financing subsidies in July 2009 | If the subsidies did not decrease the price by over 33 I would not have bought the vehicle | Also the 2009 fixed a lot of the prior model year issues e | g | COMMAND problems and a lot of options iPod bluetooth DVD were now free | At this price point the deal was a steal | Coming from an Infiniti G more hp and faster I like my change | 
 "words": This car is marvelous | The styling with the sport package is great it drives very well and is comfortable | The 350 V6 has as much horsepower as my old Mercedes 430 V8 | It's plenty fast and I get 20 MPG | It feels as stable and strong as a bank vault but drives quick and nimble too | The climate control system and 7-channel audio system also are great | My only gripe is with the nav system | It's a pain to use and the screen is too small | 
 "words": Two and a half weeks 1800 miles | Love iy -so solid yet nimble | Last car was 528i2008 | Love the tighter turning circle and ergonomics | Memory card with 510 watts is the easiest way to listen to music | Sports package with silver color is beautiful | First brand new Merc bought in part because our 98' E320 is still driving so well | Got it for 41 | 8k too | 
 "words": Never buy a mercedes unless you want to overpay for a completely unreliable vehicle | Buying one is like losing money and keeping one is like throwing good money after bad | I bought a brand new 2009 E350 | Six months of ownership and 3 problems 2 trips to the shop 1 tow 1 battery recharge | and worse of all tons of aggravation and frustration dealing with Mercedes Benz | 
 "words": Addressing the vinyl vs leather for such expensive vehicles please note that Mercedes has a long history of offering the best vinyl seating ever made which is better than most cars leather | For some reason Americans equate leather with luxury | In Europe many of the Mercedes sold have cloth velour seating | A final note on the vinyl you'll be very happy to have the vinyl 30 years from now when your E class interior looks almost as new | History and tradition are alive at Mercedes |

 "words": This was my first Mercedes purchase | a Japanese car loyalist up til this purchase | Car drives amazing gas mileage is great for this size car | I averaged 29 mpg combined | However build quality is a DISASTER | Literally on evening home from dealership the night of purchase the left headlight went out and I received an LCD error warning about headlight failure | Took it back to dealership and 3 days in shop w 3200 bill under warranty | The C series loaner I got had same headlight failure during loaner period | At 5900 the BlueTec's power steering failed while driving and I almost wrecked | steering wheel wouldn't turn | Car towed back to dealership by MB 5 days in shop | NIGHTMARE | 
 "words": This really is a fantastic car | The cargo hold is massive for a mid-size vehicle and interior passenger space is impressive plus it is really quite easy to get a child seat attached in the rear seat with little issue and it fits very firmly | The car is a blast to drive when you push it no wagon should be this fast or corner this well | The build quality is also fantastic with super-soft leather and fantastic fit and finish | Gas mileage is also remarkably decent for a 507-hp V8 | 
 "words": I recently leased a silver E350 4- matic with the Premium pkg 1 and AMG sport appearance package and boy was it a great all rounder | It has great lookscourtesy AMG package adequate performance0 -60 in 6 secs and mileage17-18MPG City Advanced Tech features such as Voice activated Navigation IPOD interface Rain sensing wipers | Also the multi information display is right in front of you on the speedo which is a nice feature since you don't have to take your eyes off the road | I live in Colorado and wanted the 4-matic and i think that was a good decision | We had a couple of snow springstorms here and AWD worked just fine | The trick is to use the C setting for the transmission |

 "words": I traded my 08 E350 Sport for a 2009 E350 sport mainly to upgrade to the new faster electronics and music | I found no major driving differences however the HD radio the NAV system the Voice Command and the increased response speed for all technology functions is amazing | There is almost nothing you can't do with the voice command system | It even has a training module to improve the voice command's understanding of your input language | Smooth ride and handling are accomplished with the sport suspension | Since I had no problems with my 08 the 09 is just icing on the cake | 
 "words": I've owned S class and E and CL class Mercedes over the years including a 2008 E Class Sport and this new 2009 E Class Sport | The pricing of the 2009 E Class is like having a Bird in the hand and two in the bush | A great deal can be had right now say 10000 off sticker | how does that sound | Now you're getting a outstanding sedan at a price you can't beat | Yes there's a new body style E Class coming out in July but how can you pass up the 2009 | Comparing my 2009 to my 2008 there have been significant improvements including AMG package free with the no charge Sport option 18 inch wheels and shift paddles on the steering wheel | The Command system with NAV is much improved | 
 "words": The car is beautifully crafted with subtle elegance | The AWD worked superbly in snow and ice | The vehicle is quiet responsive and thoughtfully designed inside and out | The voice command system is a marvel and requires little more than a quick read through the manual | Like other buyers I would have expected leather at this price | That is the one area where MB falls short | 
 "words": I purchased a 2009 E350 4matic | went from a ML350 SUV | Wow what a change | This is the best automobile I have ever owned | This car handles great and built very solid | 
 "words": A car I have fallin in love with | When driving it seems the car is an extension of my body | Easy to drive and all controls make sense | The best car I've ever owned | 
 "words": The Mercedes E 320 Blue Tec is a refined luxury sedan that is coupled with extraordinary fuel economy | The Blue Tec diesel engine provides excellent power and acceleration | The car is very comfortable with a luxury interior and the Mercedes i-Command system is easy to use and conveniently placed in the cockpit | The standard sound system is also great | This is the first diesel vehicle that I ever purchased and it won't be my last | It gets better fuel economy that the comparable Lexus hybrid | Test drive it you'll buy it | 
 "words": Since this is the last year of the w211 body style Mercedes is offering decent subsidizes incentives to move vehicles | The body is pretty much the same since 03 with a few modified faclifts | The No charge sport package adds some flair to the pretty stagnent body | The gipe I have with Mercedes is the lack of standard leather interior on car that starts at almost 52k | Vinyl belong in economy cars Not in a Mercedes Benz | 
 "words": Considered many cars in this segment including Hyundai Genesis | However picked Benz just based on badge and low price | Yes although MSRP is high you can buy E class much cheaper | My version was with 18 | wheels so suspension feels quite stiff and handling is reasonable well | Small turn radius | First look inside gives feeling of luxury | Exterior is the best looking in the segment | However if you look more closely to the car you will find that Mercedes is slipping | Standard seats are just vinyl | Leather is expensive option | No right hand rest place | Awkward storages | A lot of modern electronics which has buggy software and cumbersome user interface | Sound quality is reasonable good |
