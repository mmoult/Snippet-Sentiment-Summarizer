 "words": Love the car have 12000 miles gas mileage has been better than expected | Would like a bit more power | Just finished a vacation traveling from Pittsburgh to Maine 2500 miles averaged 28 MPG carrying quite a bit of camping equipment | The car always looks clean shines beautifully even with dust on it | 
 "words": Love the car that's why having this motor issue is so painful | Driving down the freeway and I hear tapping that gets progressively worse | With no associated lights car just shuts down | Dealer says I have blown motor come to find out that they are having problems with turbos doing so | Funny thing is everyone at Subaru acts like it hasn't happened at all | Getting new motor but not feeling good about car | Read up the turbo's are lemons | 
 "words": Recently purchased 7 25 09 | First Subaru and AWD vehicle | Wanted an Outback due to New England weathers and having cargo room for my 2 Labs | Really grips the road | No snow yet obviously but it does great in heavy rain | Stereo is supposedly premium speakers seem to rattle a little if you really turn it up | 
 "words": Purchased a 2009 Subaru Outback 2 | 5XT in Diamond Grey w Quartz Silver with slightly off Black Interior | In general this is the perfect vehicle to buy especially in this trim if you want a sporty SUV alternative | It sits up like a small SUV handles like sports sedan accelerates like a small turbo coupe and brakes like a champion | I'm still in the break in period but I have a feeling once this time passes this car will truly shine | Car rides very smooth and balanced and when bumps are transferred to the cabin they are controlled | Interior is pretty quiet with windows up and wind is buffeting noticeable with windows down | Engine is powerful in all ranges especially with boost up | 
 "words": Love the car hate the wind noise on both the passenger side- whistle and the driver side continual | Also problems with the windshield wipers | Have had it to Dealership to resolve the wind noise problems and is still not resolved to my satisfaction | We like the car I don't like the excessive wind noise | If I has noticed this in my test drive would not have purchased this vehicle- unfortunate because other than that it seems to be a great car | 
 "words": Not happy with fog lights they shine directly down to the ground even after dealer adjustment | Does not improve visibility at all | Inside of windshield has a scratch near top that can be felt with a finger nail | Other than that the car is great and the gas mileage ranges from 27-31 after 7000 miles | 
 "words": I have it for 2 months and very happy | Great feeling in S-sharp mode only using Intelligent mode in city driving | Manual transmission is great forget about automatic if you like to drive | I love the interior design and the HK sound system | Can't wait to drive it on snow but I drove it in very heavy rain and the feeling of stability is awesome | Best performance and better mileage than the Volvo XC70 at a more affordable price | 
 "words": I love this car | It shines as a well thought out vehicle | The Annapolis dealer provided the best car buying and accessories purchase I have ever experienced | I was able to get it out the door at 24k I went in at the end of the month and as we all know the 2010's are coming soon | I wanted a 2009 as I'm not comfortable buying a first year remodel of anything | This is to be a long term car for me and from the positive experiences my family and friends have had with Subaru's this can easily be a 150-200k car or more | The engine and transmission are quite capable and powerful for my city and highway driving | I get 32hwy and 28city | great mpg's for an AWD | 
 "words": I purchased my 2009 Outback 4 30 2009 | I traded my 1999 Outback | I bought the new Outback because I got a great deal and I didn't look forward to 3k miles in the very uncomfortable '99 Outback driver seat | I have only one complaint about my new Outback | The cruise control is anemic | The cruise control in my '99 the car raced up hills regardless of incline or elevation | In this car it acts like the little engine who couldn't | Climb performance is affected by incline and or elevation | On descent it has trouble holding assigned speed | The cruise control is hit or miss in the mountains and on medium to steep inclines | Otherwise the car is great and all I'd hoped it would be | so far | 
 "words": I just purchase this vehicle for couple months and made 2000 miles on this car with a trip to Tahoe | Kind of lack of power when up the hill on the Tahoe but that's 4cyl car design | The only thing I don't like and realized after the trip is the armrest too low I have no place to rest my arm | So far this is the first Subaru car I bought and it's fun to drive | 
 "words": Came to this vehicle from 2003 base forester | 2009 forester felt too minivan and flimsy | Outback is a solid feeling vehicle handles very well is quiet and relaxing on the road | Exterior of 2009 model has a sharp mature look | HK stereo is a plus | Gas mileage OK | poor in city good on freeway | Package of good high end options | At the price I paid other cars feel like plastic in comparison | If this vehicle were one foot shorter it would be fun to drive and also be a much better urban vehicle | 
 "words": I love this car | The smooth ride styling sunroof equipment cargo space tinted rear windows and gas mileage | My last car only used premium and got 13 mpg | I haul tools ladders dogs and people | With plenty of room | However the glove box is small and the center armrest doesn't hold much stuff | It could definitely use more storage cubby's for little objects | I have no place to store my CD's | My last Subaru had over 100K with no problem | 
 "words": Very pleased with my purchase and happy I opted to go for the extras on the SE model | I find the engine to be quite capable and powerful for both city and highway driving | The car feels well grounded and handles well | Nicely designed inside and out it returns quite a bang for the buck in regards to all the features in my opinion | 
 "words": In December I went about replacing my 2007 VW Passat wagon | I had a love-hate relationship with that car | Since it was winter I was starting to get sick of not making it up my hill to my house | So I looked at the Outback | It had no trouble driving through 10 inches of snow during my test dive | So I got one | It has been good not great | It's not really fast it handles pretty well and gets reasonable fuel economy for an AWD vehicle | AWD is great in the snow and the back holds lots of baby things | The HK stereo is pretty good wish the audio controls on the steering wheel would control presets and wish there was a sub control | Now that it is getting warmer I am enjoying the large sunroof | 
 "words": My wife has a Forester and I've had other Subarus in the past | My son still drives my old 94 Legacy | My new 09 Outback is the best car I've ever owned | I waited until Subaru's spring event with 2K rebate 2 | 9 to buy | The Outback seems quieter and more powerful than my wife's 07 Forester although both have the same 2 | 5 engine | The handling is very secure and it's fun to drive with its tight steering | This car inspires confidence on the road | Varying my speed during the break-in period I have managed to get 28 | 3 calculated mpg on my first two tanks | It will probably be better when I am not varying speed I think that is very good fuel economy for an AWD vehicle | 
 "words": I love driving this car | The ride is smooth yet still sporty | Subaru was clever with some really small stuff like leaving a space for your ipod cable to exit the armrest storage | A simple clip to hold up the rear floor cover which accesses the secret space under the cargo area | I have three dogs and with the 1 of the rear seats down they can move around and get comfortable | I purchased a very cool cargo cover from Canvasback of Idaho which makes clean up after taking the dogs to the lake much easier | I love the big 17 tires and two tone exterior | I have the Newport Blue Pearl which is only 1 of 2 models with the silver cladding at the bottom | The sunroof is humongous | 
 "words": My first 09 Outback was delivered to me with a broken heater | The next morning it took 7 tries to get it started | The car was replaced with another one | The second car was miss firing from the time of purchase and had a check engine light 6 days after purchase | Subaru HQ claims the miss firing is part of break in and they will not repair the vehicle | 
 "words": We researched numerous cars and had focused on the Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV-4 | We then hear about the Subaru Forester and test drove that great vehicle | But the Outback jumped into our possibilities and offered the best overall vehicle flexibility | The expressway ride and cool features appearance sold us | The HK sound system is great and our iPod came to life like never before | After we brought this home we discovered how many friends have owned Outbacks for years and will never switch to another vehicle | We are now part of the family of happy Outback owners | It is the perfect vehicle for us | 
 "words": I reluctantly traded in my beloved Audi Allroad because it was at the end of it's life | I was shopping for a manual transmission sports wagon and someone suggested the OutBack Turbo | I drove the car and was mildly impressed with the acceleration and ride so I decided to buy it | I never expected to be in the situation I'm in now | The tailgate rattles to the point that nobody wants to be in the car | I can't turn the radio up loud enough to mask it | It's been repaired 3 times and each time it rattles on the way out of the dealership | Subaru has no suggestions | Before you buy this car check out internet blogs about Outback rattles | There's literally dozens of them | This isn't uncommon | 
 "words": When we got so much ice in December of 2008 I got tired of not being able to get my truck out of the parking lot so I went to Walker's Subaru and got an Outback Legacy Wagon | Best purchase I ever made | I love the ride the lines and the AWD | Cargo area is great | I wish I had bought the Subaru 4 cars ago | I am not really into cars just want to get where I am going and so far this car does it for me | 
 "words": Standard 2 | 5i better than what I read | Very comfortable to drive | Harmon Kardon stereo so-so | Mileage seems better than I would think | 
 "words": I bought the 2009 Outback SE recently and took my wife on a road trip during some very heavy rain | The car handled extremely well on Interstate heavy rain rough roads with heavy rain and incomplete roads | Never had any traction problems | Interior is very comfortable easy to use no extra stuff to figure out simple and straight forward and the cargo area is very useful | We are expecting our first child soon and the child seat latch system seems very straight forward | 
 "words": Yep this is number eleven | First one was an 82 | We think they are the best car for the money bar none especially when you live in cold snowy or wet climates | At one time had three all Outbacks | 
 "words": Purchased the car in November 2008 in Colorado | Violent bucking forced us to a dealer in New Mexico who told us that we could only use one brand of gasoline | Returned to the Colorado dealer who told us New Mexico dealer didn't know what it was doing kept the car for awhile and replaced a camshaft sensor | assured us car was OK | It wasn't so took it to yet another dealer who replaced the turbocharger and some other parts | assured us car was OK | Observed gas mileage appears poor | We'll see if further observations confirm poor mileage | If they do we're on the way to the court house | If not we may sell it anyway | Word to the wise think twice before buying a Subaru | 
 "words": I had done the usual research of the reviews here and want to provide some additional info for potential buyers | The build quality and tightness of assembly is very good | Materials design are competitive with more upmarket brands | Overall the Subie is a great vehicle for those who are looking for versatility durability and resale value | Gas mileage is around 21-22 mixed 27 mpg hwy | Overall good value vs | Audi VW Mazda et al | 
 "words": We love this car | Size ride features quality performance and price value are all outstanding | If you live in an area or have a lifestyle that warrants AWD then a Subaru is all you need and more | ENJOY | 
 "words": I live in Colorado where snow is an issue so I needed a car with AWD | This car has excellent build quality | I previously owned a 3-series BMW and this car is comparable in many ways | The transmission is as good as the BMW as is the ride quality | Though nothing handles like a BMW IMO this comes close | You won't win many drag races with the 2 | 5 but it is adequate and fun | If I hadn't gotten so many tickets in college and therefore cost so much to insure I would've gotten the turbo I think | Overall this is a lot of car for the money | The seats are softer than my BMW but not as soft as the Volvo I test drove | I prefer softer seats when given the choice | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle only a few weeks and already love it | I traded a Toyota RAV4 2007 for the Outback | The Outback is a lot quieter | I have an 8 year old and a 3 month old and swear the back seat is wider | I love the space in the back | 
 "words": The driving is perfect | I only feel that the interior design need to be improved to create more space | I hardly can operate the windows with a door handle just 3 inches away | 
 "words": Our 9 year old Jeep Cherokee was involved in a collision that totaled the vehicle | We originally intended to replace it with another similar SUV but decided to give the Outback 2 | 5i SE a try thanks to 4 gas | The Outback has been fantastic ever since good power acceptable gas mileage nice handling good utility beautiful interior just an overall solid package with the SE trim very much worth it over base | This is a lot of car for the money totally recommended | 
 "words": With a new baby we had to ditch the pony car for this one and we are not disappointed | We liked the interior exterior acceleration comfort etc which is why we bought it | We are very happy with the car thus far and can't wait to take it camping skiing and on the road | Wind noise is noticeable but coming from a convertible this is not a problem | Stereo is great as is the 6 disc option and steering wheel controls | 
 "words": I just sold my 7 year old 2002 Legacy Wagon Lwith 215000 miles | It was very hard to part withsince it never let me down and will give the new owner many more thousands of miles | I upgraded to the Special Edition 5 speed Outback on 11 01 08 | The test drive sold me | I drive extensively in both city and highway | This is a non-pretentious car that is as good looking at the campground as it is pulling up to a top Manhattan restaurant | I expect the same reliability and longevity | I also expect greater mpg than listed since I did experience the same on my prior Subaru Wagon | Alsoannual maintenance is relatively inexpensive and resale value is high | 
 "words": I have not seen other reviews for the 2009 3 | 0R so here it is | The car is great to drive and both the stereo and nav are fun to use once you get past the complexity of the user interface | Mileage is as advertised | should not expect better with this power and AWD | Now the down side | After 5 days and 500km the check engine light came on with flashing cruise and shift control lights | The dealer had difficulty trouble shooting but claimed to find the root cause after 2 days in the shop replacing a solenoid that is used for control of one of the cams | One day after I got the car back I am staring at the same failure | This is not the reliability that I expected from a Subaru | 
 "words": Very happy with the turbo compared to the 2005 | Also this car is much quieter than the 2005 and has much better acceleration | Very comfortable seats for long distances | Harmon Kardon stereo is an improvement but there are rattles from the front doors probably from things in the storage areas | Prefer the multifunction display to be under the storage area instead of under the speedometer tach | Also like the feature to adjust the throttle response and turbo to either sport for stronger acceleration or intelligent for better gas mileage | I just leave it on intelligent unless I want to pass and it really shoots around when you punch the gas | 
 "words": We own a bmw 7 series and Mercedes E Class and I have to say I am impressed with the quality of the interior | I think it's on par with the Benz | Harmon Kardon radio is excellent | Leather seats are nice | I'm not tall I'm 57 so I have no complaints sitting anywhere in the wagon | We needed a car that would serve as our daily commuter to work from the suburbs to Manhattan | This is our 3rd Subaru for this purpose | If you're looking for a car that will protect your family and keep you on the roads no matter the road weather conditions then this is it | We are extremely happy with this car | IMO this is a good alternative to those large SUVs because it's easier to navigate and park in the city | 
 "words": I've had my Outback for a month now and put on 1200 miles | It has exceeded my expectations so far | I'm just out of a 2005 Nissan Murano and I expected that it would be a step down in almost all regards except gas mileage | While it isn't quite as comfortable a ride and the quality of interior isn't quite as good I've been pleasantly surprised at how well the car drives | Except for pedal-to-the-metal acceleration it honestly feels like a 6 cylinder not a 4 | Good torque and power delivery | The handling is better than the Muranos no doubt due to the considerably lower center of gravity | Gas mileage so far is consistently 24 | 6 mpg through each of 3 tankfuls | 
 "words": This thing handles like a sports car rides very nice and has quiet interior | I get 26-27 avg mpg using 87 reg | There's plenty of room to haul camping and fishing gear | 
 "words": Having recently purchased an Outback I was pleasantly surprised with how much fun this car is sporty handling nice balance very good 5-speed shifter | It has much sportier character than one would expect from a wagon | Recently I had spent some time driving on semi-paved country roads and was impressed with the suspension that made driving over the potholes and washed- out portions of the road bearable | Although I do not get good mileage in the city barely 20 mpg it probably has more to do with my driving style | On the highway I am consistently in the 26-28 mpg range | 
 "words": We have a baby now so we needed something more versatile than our previous car '02 BMW 325i but just as sporty and fun to drive | The Subaru Outback delivers in every way | It's a great looking wagon inside and out the build quality is solid and in 2 | 5 XT form it's more powerful than our old BMW | I couldn't ask for more | The Outback is smooth and powerful and feels like a much more expensive car | It's very quiet and low-revving I barely go over 4000 RPM | There's plenty of room in the rear for a baby-stroller groceries luggage golf clubs etc | In our old sedan that was a major issue | The 5 speed manual is responsive and crisp | The 2 | 5 XT Limited is the best Outback available period | 
 "words": As a first time Subaru owner I did not know what to expect | It is the first car that I have owned that does not have a frame around the door's windows | Maybe I do not drive the way the others do but my mileage has been less than expected | My last car was a Toyota Highlander and did really well in the snow and not bad on mileage so this new car has a lot to live up to | I have owned others Acura Nissan Audi and Toyota and in my opinion all had better initial quality | I am looking forward to the snow because I have heard great things | 
 "words": I was disabled back in 06 and I need a car I know is going to last | After months of research the choice was obvious I just wanted to wait till the 09s were out because they come standard with VDC which was well worth the wait after driving it | If you have any common sense you'll find it almost impossible to throw this car out of control | There's a store in the neighborhood that just sprayed their lot with sealant very slick when wet | It rained yesterday morning so off I went | Around and around I couldn't get this thing to spin out | Finally I just went in circles until the car went beyond what the tires could handle and I slid sideways | 20 Stars | 
 "words": This is an update on my Soobie | Man I have to say that this is one great car | I have no complaints after 5400 miles | No problems great ride and the gas mileage is going up just like everyone said it would | My best to date was 33 | 7 MPG | I change my own oil and will do my others as well when the time comes | It is easy to work on this car if you are slightly mechanically inclined | Everything is reachable | This is going to be my 10 years car | Sorry Subaru but I am keeping this one for a long time | It is obvious it will last | 
 "words": Well this is my first Subaru | I am very happy with this purchase | The only thing is I drove off the lot with a tapping in one of my tires | Turns out a screw came loose and stuck in my tire | It was from the Tire Pressure Monitor | Strange | Still waiting on a special screw for this part | It's been 3 days | Otherwise the car is great | The dealer replaced the tire for free | I drive 100 miles a day and it get's better gas mileage as it breaks in | This will be a long term keeper for me |
