REVIEWS
 "words": The Venza is perfect for our current needs and has been a joy to drive in both city and rural mountain driving | With two of three teenagers in college we no longer needed 7 seats and traded in a Honda Odyssey which we loved | But the Venza is a more luxurious car and we like the security of AWD along with all the safety features | Fit and finish are great reliability has been perfect in the first 7000 miles | Backup camera as part of the navigation package is very helpful | Backup on its own has too small a display | Teenagers love the sound system and the MP3 plug and play capability | Looked at the Lexus RX350 but the Venza is virtually identical and is 8000 less | 
 "words": After driving this for only 4 months I was really disappointed | The extremely large dash started coming apart | I had a constant loud rattling noise coming from the a c vents on the dash which they replaced and still did not help plus every time I would go over the slightest bump the car had really loud squeaking coming from underneath | Well took it to the dealership to get fixed did not work | A new car should not have those issues at 2800 miles already | Plus it is really loud inside lots of road noise | Needless to say traded it in for the new 2010 Buick LaCrosse | Now I am happy | Toyota just does not have the quality construction it once did | Lost it for me | 
 "words": I have had my 4 cyl | Venza for two weeks now and am very happy | I did a lot of research on vehicles in this class and selected the Venza because it had the best mileage in its class and because of historical Toyota reliability | I test drove both the V6 and V4 and did not notice much of a difference in the way they drove | Everything is within reach and the base vehicle most of the extras included | I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV crossover vehicle | 
 "words": I came out of an 07 F-150 so I won't compare apples to oranges | I love the responsive steering | The V6 has quite the pickup particularly on the highway | It's easy to lose track of how fast you're going as the drive is very smooth | Love all the gadgets and cubbies for stuff | I have a bad back so seating is important to me | This seat is very comfy and easy to adjust | My son says the back seat is more comfortable than my husband's Lincoln Town Car | Very happy with my new car | My boss wasn't too happy as I work at a Ford dealership | Not many of these around yet so I get lots of looks and questions | Highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": We are empty nester baby boomers that wanted easier entry than our former Acura MDX but with creature comforts decent performance good reliability upright seating cargo capacity for our dogs and stuff and some style | The Venza suited us better than any of the alternatives we tested | We were seduced by a loaded Venza in Blizzard Pearl | The price was still less than our Acura MDX in 2001 | 
 "words": Good room and nice ride but steering uncomfortable perhaps because of 20 tires | Dash is massive and makes vehicle feel huge and more like an RV | Good cargo room with or without rear seats down | Good pep and fairly agile for size | Been driving a BMW X3 and wanted more cargo room which this has but handling just doesn't compare even though ride a bit smoother | Sloped front end makes parking a bit of a challenge in tight spaces until accustomed to it | Feels a bit like driving one of the giant sedans of the 60's | 
 "words": Went to the dealership looking for a Highlander same size as a Highlander | When we drove the Venza fell in love with it | We were impressed by the smooth drive of the car and the pick up on acceleration | My husband loved it at first sight | Love the comfort and room | 
 "words": My wife and I decided to buy a Venza after renting a Camry in California | We wanted a car that was SUV-like but more of a sedan interior | We have a Honda Pilot which we both like very much and we thought the Venza would give us sedan characteristics with some SUV features | We were right in making the decision to buy the Venza | It has exceeded our expectations | We love the ride and handling | The mileage on two trips has been between 26 and 30 mpg | It is extremely comfortable for both my wife and I | I'm 6'4 and she's 5'2' | We both fit the car nicely | We chose the sunroof option and I have no problem with headroom | The V6 has way more zip than the 4 cyl that we test drove |

 "words": I love the Venza and would recommend it to everyone | My husband and I just came from a 200 mile trip and it was great | The weather was BAD but the Venza didn't mind it at all no problems and the navagations was sooo very helpful over all I have a lot of faith in the Venza | I only have it for 1 and half months | I can't think it would give me any problems | In the next 6 months I will let you know if I have any problems I have a lot of faith in it and don't think I will | 
 "words": I have had my car a little over a week and I couldn't be more pleased | Last year I bought a Honda Accord EX-L that I could not sell fast enough | Before the Honda I had a SAAB for 9 years that I loved | Since SAAB wagon was out of the question this time I looked for a wagon to replace it | The only thing available last year was too big for me | This crossover is perfect | The drive the JBL the Panoramic Roof and over all comfort | The driver and passenger seating is roomy | I have all the features on the car except the NAV | and DVD | I have enjoyed all the features | The brakes are stiff but that is better than too sensitive | I am looking forward to low maintenance unlike the SAAB | 
 "words": I owned this carnew 1 day and the SRS warning lights went off and they continue to go off intermittently | 5 days after purchase along with the SRS light the VSCskid lights are appearing | 6 days after purchase the dealer doesn't know what to do and I am asked to bring the car back for an undisclosed amount of time | They will provide a loaner | I read the Tundra complaints on this and they are the same | The lights were not on when I took it back for service and they said they couldn't do anything for me unless they saw the lights | After turning the car onoff 100 times they saw the light and have the code s | We will see what they do say but so far I am not happy | Will post update | 
 "words": I bought my new Venza in January from Jerry's Toyota in Baltimore and have loved it from the beginning | The ride handling and exterior styling is great | Drives like a Lexus traded in a RX300 |

 "words": Features like Keyless Go Bluetooth Stereo and Hands-Free Cellular Automatic Tailgate Remote Folding Seat Lever 20 in wheels and rear-view camera make this a great value | The ride is nice and sedan-like | The wide stance makes it very stable | The stated fuel economy puts it among the best in its class | The fit and finish is like a Lexus | We've owned BMW Landrover and this meets or exceeds them both | The legroom could be better in the back but it is OK | You could spend 60k for all of this and not get as refined a package | The resale should be OK too | This is our first Toyota so we will see about that | 
 "words": We traded in our 2007 Camry SE v-6 to purchase the Venza after my wife saw it and felt it was the hatchback she had been looking for | The Camry I feel never got the recognition it deserved for being a true hot rod both in sheer speed and handling while also being quite docile in everyday driving | The Venza is like a Camry wagon with the same drive train length and same suspension as the SE model | The Venza is well appointed and with a few options added is really nice | The size of the vehicle is just right for most the seating is very comfortable and even the six speaker stereo which we have is clean and crisp in sound | Sitting next to my built '77 Cherokee provides quite a contrast | 
 "words": Comfortable and sleek fun to drive | What I like most about this car is the spacious interior and uncommon looks of exterior design | Also it drives comfortably and handles nicely | What I don't like about it is that I hear some noise during sudden acceleration and hard to change lanes and make turns during traffic | Still I think the VENZA is fantastic car because it drives like Camry and rides high like SUV |

 "words": Powerful on acceleration all wheel drive for various weather conditions reasonable gas mileage up to date electronics plenty of interior space for 5 adult passengers and a nifty interior and exterior design all go into making our V6 AWD Venza a real pleasure to drive | Venza fits the bill for any car buyer who feels lost between the bloated low mileage truck frame sport utility vehicles and the claustrophobic small frame cross-over vehicles | Buy this car it is a winner | 
 "words": Toyota doesn't bring out many new vehicles but when it does it's time to pay attention | First impressions were great and when I bought the venza I was not disappointed | It's got the styling drives like a car but is practical like an suv | The venza has a ton of neat features-power rear door back up camera storage compartment and accessory holders | The list goes on | My one concern was the blindspots but it has not been an issue | The awd is great in the snow too no need to throw on winter tires every year | This vehicle fits all my needs and with Toyota reliabilty and strong resale value I look forward to years of enjoymeat |

 "words": Needed the ease of entering and exiting vehicle that a SUV offers rather then sitting down into a sedan | This was the perfect choice | In between a sedan and SUV | Picked it up last week first one sold at dealer | Impressed with design and performance | The base model comes with all the features you would expect to pay more for in Camry LE | Dual A C fog lights power driver seat instrument display for temp time trip lighted vanity mirrors built in satellite radio nice rims tinted glass | Far more value and features then Camry LE sedan model offered let alone roomier |

 "words": I wanted sport car like handling but needed to tow a 2700lb trailer | The Highlander was too expensive and the handling characteristics of the Venza is much better | The car feels more balanced than the 57 43 front rear weight would suggest | Plenty of power and corners like a slot car compared to the Highlander or Rav4 due to the lower center of gravity | Love the interior room and comfort and ergonomics | I have been getting 24 mpg combined city highway and easily get 27 mpg straight hwy |

 "words": We got the navigation system which I really thought we didn't need especially since you can't get it with the entertainment system | But the touch screen just can't be beat for information and fun if you like computers | The car is very luxurious and the ride is just about a perfect compromise between comfort on the road and on dirt or sand | I don't know what those folks who knock the ride are talking about | The 20 wheels do make for a little harshness but big bumps are taken in stride | Don't even think about getting the four cylinder engine | Even the 6 cylinder is short on low end torque but pulls nicely once you get moving |

 "words": Taking advantage of Cash for Clunkers I traded in my Nissan Xterra and Toyota Camry Hybrid | I liked the Venza because it was similar to the Camry and I knew that I would have a short learning curve for Navigation etc | The seats are quite comfortable and the Navigation has nice voice-controlled update from the Camry | Love the 20 wheels and the AWD | Obviously mileage is less than the Hybrid but for the V6 it is not bad | Still breaking in the engine and trying not to go over 55 mph on highway but sometimes I get carried away | Smooth engine and lots of power |

 "words": Perfect car to travel with because of its cargo arrangement options and seating space | The comfort of the passenger seat was of utmost importance to us | The seat is broad enough has enough leg room and recline capabilities so the passenger has positional options during a trip | However it has one defeat-if books or grocery bags are placed on the front passenger seat the seat belt signal sounds | Wish the passenger could do map tracking to specific hotels food etc | while the car is being driven from area to area | This would be wonderful for spur of the moment decisions while driving along | Wish the width of the back cargo space immediately behind the back seat was the same as at door area |
