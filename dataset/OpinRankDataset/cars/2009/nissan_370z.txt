 "words": I traded in my 2005 BMW 330CI with the sport pkg and sequential manual tranny | It was a quality vehicle and fun to drive | I test drove the 370 Z and felt it was more me than the BMW | It looks great turns headshas rapid acceleration shifts easily and corners like it is on rails | Im 5'11 and weigh 170 | The seats are comfy head room is ample and leg room is good | I now have over 1200 miles on the car mfr's break in periodand engine and tranny feel much better | I live in East Texas and the temp has been in the mid 90's and low 100's since I've had the Z | 240 degrees is the highest the engine oil has gotten | The Z engine is noisy but seems quieter as it breaks in | 
 "words": I purchased my Nissan 2009 370Z Car on February 26 2009 | I have been very disappointed with my 2009 370Z Car because you can't drive it over 4000 RPM's if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees | As a result I only have 630 miles on my 370Z | The 370Z Car without an engine oil cooler will over-heat | The engine oil temperature reaches 280 degrees if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees and it will do it in a very short period of time | When this happens the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower | 
 "words": My previous autos were an 08 TL TypeS an 06 Vette and an 05 Charger Daytona | I know performance and quality | The 370Z has more of both than any of my previous vehicles | She's perfect for hotrodding around town and a great interstate cruiser at 79mph yep in the summer | I ledfoot it all the time and have never seen my oil temp gauge above 225 I live in Central Georgia | Build quality and finish are outstanding | Heat isn't an issue unless you take it to the track | And if you intend to at its price point what's the big deal about putting an oil cooler on it | Worried about warranty | Don't race the car | After 14000 troublefree mi the car is simply without peer cost value performance | 
 "words": The get up and go of the VQ37 engine is amazing it oozes power | Very flat torque curve keeps pulling harder as you shift | The car bleeds sex appeal no matter who pulls up alongside you heads are turning men and women alike | By far one of the best looking sports cars out especially for the money | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle after 6 months of research | I got the sport package which I would recommend due to styling cues and the great rims | I previously owned a 06 350Z | The new design of this vehicle is so much better that the 350Z | The intelligent key is amazing | I recommend reading the owners manual to uncover some great features | The key can roll the windows up and down but the intelligent key can only roll the windows down | Cruise control is now standard and the syncro-rev works perfectly | It also helps with a smoother upshift | I can not drive any where with out people straining to look | Road noise is acceptable and the ride is smooth for a true sports
 "words": Have owned many sports cars before from MG's to Porsche's but never had a Z | The 370Z really looks the part aggressive integrated and brazen | The interior is a good place to drive in and the seats work well for spirited driving | I have the touring pkg | with alcantra seat inserts that are comfortable in hot or cold weather | This thing goes great brakes well handles well and is flat out just FUN | I considered a Porsche Boxster or Cayman but this is more involving at 2 3rds the price | Not as refined but you're not paying Porsche prices for parts or service and it is arguably more fun in daily driving | Ride is firm but comfortable on the highway | Handling not upset by bumps

 "words": Hey out there All you new 2009 370Z Car owners need to ensure that your 370Z Car can handle high Ambient temperatures | I live in Georgia and the ambient temperature is almost always above 90 degrees during the months of June July August and September | I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER | The 370Z can not handle driving at speeds of 60 MPH or more with out the ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE reaching the 280 degree mark which is what Nissan indicates is the MAX OIL TEMPERATURE the car should operate at | All 370Z car owners should contact Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department and demand a RECALL |

 "words": I would drive this for at least one day before buying the seats are very poor quality and can cause terrible jostling when driving over any bumps in road you cannot drive this any distance without incredible back discomfort I would not recommend this car the discomfort and non support has taken all the fun out of driving this car | I tried to get the seats fixed but it was impossible as per Nissan as well | 
 "words": I have only had my 370z for 2 days now and it is the best one yet | I have owned a 1978 280z 1984 300z 1991 twin turbo z 2003 350z and now the 370 and all where great but none compare to 370 | If Nissan keeps getting this car right at this kind of price I will still be driving a z when I'm 80 yrs old |

 "words": Have 2008 350Z very impressive | Only minor issues in 30000 miles | Obviously went to see 2009 370Z to compare | Gone are the leather door panel trim for left over seating materials | Gone is the rear storage which was huge for this car | Gone is the accessible 2nd power point | Now located inside the armrest | Gone is the hideaway cup holder replaced by an ugly hole in the center tunnel | Gone is the blended center dash flip up door | Replaced by an ugly covering of leatherette with white stitching that stands out and constantly grabs your attention | Gone is the rear wiper | Question A tow hitch port in rear bumper |

 "words": I only want to comment about negatives aspects of the car because there are too many positives | First Nissan needs to fix the dull looking fuel guage | Also the guages are very hard to see in the sun light | Second and PLEASE NISSAN LISTEN TO ME ON THIS | PLEASE have an option to display the SPEEDOMETER DIGITALLY | I can't tell you how much easier it is to have a digital display | If not replace the traditonal needle with the digital display at least give us an option to show it with a multifunction display inside the speedometer like Honda and Mercedes-Benz has done | Fix some blind spots and the rear visibility but I guess that might take away from the exterior beauty of the car | 
 "words": You can't go wrong with this car | Great car for your money |

 "words": This is my fourth Z and is clearly the best in overall performance and can match or outperform almost any sports car on the road | I test drove a Porsche Boxster the day before I bought the 370Z and it matched its performance as well as being quicker | I had some reservations about the restyling from the 350 before I saw it but it's gorgeous | The Sports Package with SyncroRev matching TC bigger and dagger styled wheels is worth it | At 6'0 I felt very comfortable in the cockpit | I usually negotiate the price down but even at MSRP it was a steal | 
 "words": Great looking fun and fast | Only have 100 miles on it so far | No regrets on this baby | 
 "words": The car looks great and is fun to drive | The ride is a little tight which is to be expected with the sport suspension | With the seven speed automatic transmission the shifts are at the correct rpm and the engine idles at highway speed | The high school teens drool at the sight of the new Z car | I hope to keep this car for a long time | 
 "words": The 370z is a great handling bang for the buck sports car | The interior is really comfortable and has fantastic styling inside and out | No other sports coupe comes close in this price range | Synchro rev matching is fun but does get old after a while |

 "words": I was driving a Cayman S and the Z car is a totally different animal | I know they are suppose to be competitors but the Cayman is much more comfortable and feels like the precision Porsche Euro sports car that it is and the Z car feels like a cramped Japanese sports car which it is | No comparison but I just wanted to try the Z car for a year or two but im going back to the Cayman S next time | Dollar for dollar the Z is a good value though and if you arent 6-1 like me its probably a better value | A smaller person might not feel as cramped as I do | I just fit in Euro cars better | Acceleration was ok but the Cayman S just feels more exhilarating for some reason | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle the day after it was delivered to the lot I just couldn't resist it | While the interior has improved when compared to the 350 model there is still very little storage and extreme blind spots | 4 cupholders are really 1 considering you lose 1 if you want to plug in your phone or iPod and the 2 in the doors are too small to even hold a standard 16 | 9 FL OZ H2O bottle | But the space behind the seats is convenient for a purse jacket Kleenex etc | I was able to pick up a friend at the airport with two good sized suitcases | The cockpit truly is driver friendly and it has all the conveniences of the newer vehicles in a much more exciting wrapper |
