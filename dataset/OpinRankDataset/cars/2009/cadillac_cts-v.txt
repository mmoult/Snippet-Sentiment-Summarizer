 "words": What else can I say other than I absolutely love this car | Wahoo | 
 "words": Traded in 2008 BMW M3 coupe for full boat 09 CTS-V auto | Have been watching this car prior to ever purchasing the M3 but needed more space so I made the move | Looks are terrific and simply unparralled by the competition | What I did notice about this car is the obvious thrust torque that goes with its monster engine | But I noticed that the car starts to handle and steer better as you increase speed | The suspension seems to set-up better steering more response and crisp | My only grip is don't forget coming out of M3 is that there are a lot more creeks and noices coming from interior parts and the seats | Great car for GM yes DNA of the best cars on the road not yet | 
 "words": Finally pulled the trigger on the CTS-V as I could not refuse the almost 11000 in discounts GM offers at this time on this model year | I cannot comment on reliability yet but I can tell you that you should NOT test-drive it unless there is a chance that you can afford to buy it | My test drive took 20 minutes with a smiling sales guy pressed into the seat and it was the most visceral and yet sublime experience I ever had in an automobile | External styling interior engine suspension brakes steering feel infotainment system | everything is a work of art | Cadillac absolutely hit a home-run and may have made the finest American car ever | 
 "words": Now my 21st car all else in past fails compared to my new CTS-V | I had my doubts with a American made car it's quality | I wasn't sure I needed this much HP | I for sure never spent over 70000 for any car before until now | All I can say is this car is a work of art gives new meaning to sport luxury | I'm thrilled I bought it it's worth every penny | 
 "words": I am a 20-year loyal Honda Acura buyer so I bought this car with some trepidation as I have high expectations from my cars | I am NOT sorry I bought this car four months and 4500 miles ago trading up from my beloved Acura RL | It lives up to EVERY bit of hype heaped upon it in the auto media | It is FAST it is QUIET inside the interior is high-quality and the car is STEALTHY in that cops won't notice this car AT ALL | The torque is everywhere you want it to be | There are few buttons and they are large and intuitive | I didn't buy the car for gas mileage but it sure could use another gallon in the tank | Range is 240 miles in mixed 50-50 city freeway driving less when fooling around | 
 "words": 6sp manual with recaros now with Hennessey intake AR Headers tune about 615 HP 521 to the rear wheels per dyno | Car is a blast but traction is an issue even in 104 degree weather | Just have to get over the fact that you can't floor it in 1st or 2nd in any weather without blowing the tires completely | 3rd gear hooks up in 90 degree weather and we'll see about cooler days this fall | Interior is very nice but there is a bit more interior noise than in an audi I owned | 14-15 MPG average really isn't that bad for a 600HP sedan | Gadgets are very nice | The 8 inch nav touch screen is impressive | Excellent toy if scaring three passengers on the way to lunch is your cup of tea | 
 "words": When you get behind the wheel of this monster already cranked-up thank you remote start you really know how a jet-jockey must feel getting into the cockpit of their already fired-up jet | Strap yourself down select the manner in which you choose to drive and take off | I do wear my silk scarf when ever I can before taking off | Power speed and control at levels unheard of with a production line manufactured 4 door sedan bar none | Then there are the looks | Talk about a phallic symbol on a testosterone high | Just point me in the general direction and get out of my way | This baby will get there and get there with maximum Velocity | which is exactly what the V in CTS-V stands for | 
 "words": Absolutely blown away by this car | Folks this is better than my 2005 Porsche C4S | I cannot believe how much power and straight line tracking this car delivers | 
 "words": The V is by any standards the best vehicle in it's grouping the very best | Sheer power handling and the excellent overall build is fantastic | If you have an M5 shame on you for not buying American steel and to top if off the Cops do not have a clue about this vehicle | Can blow the doors off most anything on the road and the stealth factor kicks hindend | 
 "words": Please do not buy the V | I enjoy driving around knowing that there are very few vehicles that can deliver the fun speed luxury ride and FANTASTIC Power M-5's and the rest look great in my rear view mirror | The power on corners straightaways and what ever is already there and I have the Automatic | Do not tell the euro snobs of the V keep it still and please do not tell law enforcement | They drive by all the time looking at the CTS badge not having a clue | I keep looking straight ahead and be good on the street as impossible as it is to be good | Do not let the unwashed masses know of this V I like the fact no one knows of the V a great secret | The interior lighting at n
 "words": Loaded CTS-V with Auto | More fun than I have had in years | I have had two BMW-M's two Mercedes SL's and about 9 Corvettes and none measure up | This car really lives up to the hype and then some | I hope GM can keep building these so more people can have the same fun | If the government takes over they will probaqbly kill it as not PC | Buy one now while you can | 
 "words": I have owned several Vettes BMW's and many specialty cars | I have never driven something this much fun | Push the pedal and go | quickly | It will blister the tires on command | Drives through corners on a rail and keeps on asking for more | Don't count on good gas mileage | It is to much fun to push the accelerator | I will likely keep this car forever | 
 "words": I have two Corvette's | One built by Chevrolet '77 L-82 350 350 coupe and one by Cadillac '09 CTS-V Touring Sedan | Guess which one is faster and more powerfull but not quite as slick looking just by a little bit | There is not a Beamer or Mercedes worth the 30 to 40k more I'd be willing to pay for their prestige | Besides the Corvette Touring Sedan -V looks much cooler that either of them especially out of my rear view mirror | Been there done that many times before and they flat out ain't worth it | Nor the 110K at least needed to purchase the coupe version of my CTS-V i | e | ZR-1 | 
 "words": There is no better automobile for the money than this four door supercar | How would you like to buy a 4 door 110000 ZR-1 with better seats and interior for 65-70000 | Of course you would | and you can | I did and the car is about 20000 under-priced relative to any real competitor
 "words": This car is great luxury features performance roomy and did I mention performance | The ride is very smooth and controlled no mater how you drive it | It is not as loud as you might expect from a performance sedan and just a joy to drive | The quality is as good as you can get and I have found no problems with it | The performance is off the scale the Recarro seats are fantastic and the interior is well layed out and functional not to mention beautiful | I have gotten an average of 11 | 4 MPG since I bought it but this is not a hybrid | This is my dream car thanks Cadillac for making my dream come true and providing such a great example of Good Ol American Know How |
