 "words": Had this car for three months and I cant wait for the winter months to see how it handles in the snow | A great fun to drive little vehicle | It is very sturdy and you sit up high in it | lots of space and plenty of room for passengers | VERY handsome vehicle
 "words": I've traded my Honda civic for this car and it was worth it | Immaculate reliability and I average 28 mpg city | I got this car for a little less than 12 thousand and I have been very satisfied | My mom convinced me to get it because she had an Aerio with 267000 miles with no problems | Great warranty | I call her Suzy and the girls like her too they tell me she's cute | But overall great car for the money get yourself a Suzy and stop paying 20000 for Hondas and Toyotas power windows are not even standard in the base price | This car is worth every penny and it's Japanese quality | Could you imagine if it had more horsepower | 
 "words": I bought my car in July because of the awd | I love driving it | great gas mileage | The GPS box got broken | and they will be replacing it for free | also love the fact that i got a free gas card for purchasing it | I got a great price traded in 2 cars for it | 
 "words": Let me start w how much I love this car | From the 34 mpg I just averaged on a trip to CA last week to the great navigation system the heated seats the panoramic view the spacious trunk space the back seats that comfortably seat a 170 lb | Great Dane and the AWD 2WD Auto system that leaves me looking forward to snow there are only 4 things I would suggest improving on Adding a sunroof adding a 6th gear manual a little more power and more comfortable seats headrests | I did a lot of research I knew what to expect | It's a lot of extra's for the money but if you are looking for luxury this is not the car for you | I love my car | Great job Suzuki | 
 "words": This is a nice small medium size car | Has a very strong engine for its category a lot of space and it is priced better than the competition | 
 "words": In the short while that I've owned this car the airbag sensor has gone off -requiring the front passenger seat to be replaced | It now squeaks continuously if someone sits in it | The Keyless entry start system seems to be questionable -I have now had to replace the key fobs twice because they do not recognize the car | There are 3 small cheap plastic coverings under the back seat -one of these fell off the other day | Apparently the car I purchased is less than perfect | It only has 2000 miles on it | I'm so wishing I could get rid of it but I'm stuck with it for the time being | One certainly gets what one pays for | 
 "words": Loving the Suzuki Crossover so far | Got the loaded Touring trim | Lots and lots of extras for the money | CAN NOT beat the features for the money | Nav heated seats and mirrors keyless entry and start | Great safety features | insureance only went up 12 yr | Drives and handles great | Biggest for us was the AWD | Can't wait to drive it around during a Maine winter | We've owned Toyota Mitsu VW Dodge Pontiac | We believe we got the best value for the money by far this time around | We also love that everyone else isn't driving one | We'll see how it holds up | If it does well for a while we plan to return for a Suzuki purchase for our other vehicle | the Equator truck to replace a Durango | 
 "words": I've had the 2009 Suzuki SX4 Crossover for less than a month now | It is scheduled to go into the shop early next week because the airbag light has come on and will not go off | Browsing the internet blogs I have discovered that this is quite problematic for Suzuki and the SX4 | Other owners have complained that Suzuki is not honoring its warranty and are not being cooperative | A courtesy car will most likely not be offered since the car is technically operable just not sure how safe it is to drive | will the airbags deploy when I driving down the street | do the airbags work | The fuel economy continues to be very poor | The driver's seat is causing back pain and I'm a healthy 38yo man | 
 "words": This car is great | It has a personality looks good and runs well | Originally designed by Fiat | 
 "words": This is a great car | I've had mine for a year now and it has run flawlessly and handles great | It very much is the crossover vehicle that it is supposed to be | It is a very small cross-over SUV | People want to compare it to sub- compacts but it is really not in that class | It has much bigger wheels and chassis which reduce its gas mileage but give it much greater strength when stressed | It has a 7 ground clearance vs 4 for most sedans | This car can be compared to smaller SUVs | Think of something like a Hundai Tuscon but strip away all the hunky metal | An extremely lean frame is put onto a solid chassis | It has plenty of room for 4 people | It drives well at high speeds long distances | 
 "words": I traded my 2005 C-class 4matic mercedes for touring model of the sx4 crossover | I was wanting a smaller car with awd for the colorado winters | I've only had the car a few days | So far so good | It is sporty getting around town but it really has to work hard to get up the foothills of the Rocky Mts | SX has the same fuel economy as the benz | I seriously considered the Honda Fit but the Fit had a rough ride on even smooth roads and had horrible road noise even at low speeds | The SX4 has a surprisingly smooth ride and minimal road noise | It is a little more exotic than the hondas and toyotas- at least around Denver | The view from inside the car gives impression of a bigger car
 "words": I could not be any more please with the quality and attention to detail very fun to drive | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 SX4 Sedan last June that got totaled when someone rear- ended me on April fools' day | So I get a 2009 SX4 Crossover with navigation and would like to point out the differences I noticed from the 2008 Sedan which I put over 13000 miles on | 5-Speed Smoother clutch action easier to make smoother shifts | Shifter works smoother too | Ride Electronic Stability Program ESP is also standard | I noticed less body roll in sharp curves and a more stable ride quality | More fun to drive | Interior Controls a little smoother interior panels seem to be of better quality | And I can't help but love the hatch with the fold-and-tumble seats along with a rear window wiper | 
 "words": I bought this car right before winter started I had a Toyota Matrix before and boy was I glad | This car is great in the snow | It gets me where I need to be from snowy roads in New Hampshire through crowded streets and in tight parking spots in downtown Boston | This car is powerful small easy to parallel park and fun to drive | Although it is small it is well designed | My son sits in the back in his toddler seat no problem | I have also sat in the backseat and while it isn't as spacious as a SUV of course your feet aren't squished | The seats and spacing is well designed | 
 "words": This purchase was forced on me by my dying truck | I was trying to wait until the summer but had to go car shopping a little early | I test drove the automatic which was what I wanted | This thing moves pretty well | The steering is tight and very responsive | The interior has plenty of head room and the dash is very well lit | AWD is available but I haven't used it yet | Snow has been lite | Strange thing is people question me on why I brought this car instead of a Honda Subaru Fordetc | For me I like to think outside of the box and not be the follower | This car is more than what some would think | Give it a shot before you shoot it down | You'll enjoy the Crossover and its features | 
 "words": I bought the middle tech package with 2WD and 5-speed | The car is great fun to drive and a rare small crossover model that is actually comfortable with great seats and dash layout | I test drove the automatic but it was boring | The 5 speed is more like a beamer in that it drives very tight corners and hugs the road nicely and is fun | The layout of the folding seats is well designed and there's plenty of room in the back for stowing items | With auto show coupon and rebate car is available way below dealer cost | best value in mini crossovers under 16K for the tech package | Car even comes with loaner privileges and 3 year roadside assistance | Wish I had gotten AWD but don't need it in FL |
