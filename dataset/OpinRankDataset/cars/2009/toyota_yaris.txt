 "words": I wanted a reliable fuel efficient vehicle to get me to work store etc | This is it | I've had this car 10 months put 16K miles on it and it hasn't given me an ounce of trouble | On an average tank of gas combination of highway town I get between 39-41mpg | I run 80mph on the interstate with plenty left handles great | The dash in the middle takes getting used to and the corner posts are too thick impeding vision especially backing out of a parking place I would like to see a tach temp gauges | Besides that this car is great | No regrets | 
 "words": We love this car | It is everything we were looking for in a small commuter car | My wife calls it the Hummingbird because it requires so little fuel to get around | We chose the S and Power package which gives you all the features you need | My only complaint is that the Turn-signal indicator is too quiet | We choose the Manual 5-spd and have no regrets | Seats are firm visibility is OK center-mount dash layout takes a little while to get use to but is very nice at night since there is no light distraction directly in front of you | And we love the style and look of the S model |

 "words": Great car except for driving | Poor handling steering imprecise at highway speeds shifting into 5th is clunky visibility out of vehicle poor thick door posts headrests block lines of sight bigger blind spot than my old car | Our old 1978 or 1981 Civics would eat the Yaris alive and spit out the pieces | Driving is now a chore not an enjoyable experience | No ash tray good for storing insurance card etc | no external antenna degrades reception speedometer needle hard to see when wearing sunglasses have to check proper operation but rear seat seat belts seem to be obstacles when the seat is down |

 "words": My intention was to purchase a Camry because I prefer larger cars but I took a look at the Yaris as a basis of comparison | I was pleasantly surprised with the room this car has inside | Outside it appears very small esp | the 2-door | This is why I chose the sedan | Inside is really cavernous | It came with ABS side airbags standard gas mileage is AMAZING | Quality is great | If it was cheaper by 1000 it would be a perfect 10 in my book |

 "words": I rented a similar Yaris last summer and got 39 mpg's | My Mazda 5 was out of warranty and I was intrigued with this little cruizer again and gave up some room and features for the economy of the Toyota Yaris S | I like the look of the S model | I miss the steering wheel controls I had on my Mazda and the plastic in the yaris smells funny in a cheap way but the car seems to run on vapors and rarely needs a fill up | Fun to drive parked next to a Mini Cooper the other day and loved the way the S looked sitting next to a much more expensive car great stance | 
 "words": This is my first stick shift | I love the look of this car | After looking at multiple used cars I decided that it was a better deal to get the yaris | I have found it to be very easy to learn how to drive a manual on this car and it definitely gets up and goes when you tell it to | I only drive about 15 miles to work but the mpgs on this car are amazing and save me a lot of money on gas | Overall the inside does feel cheap but that's what you get in an economy car | Overall a great little car |

 "words": So far so Good | Very impressive pep for such a small car | Runs smooth at 80 or at 18mph | Also this little car turns on a dime | Really fun to drive | Reasonably quiet ride on decent road surfaces | A tiny bit more roady and harsh on bumps but what do you expect on a small wheel base car | Love the center dash display except the fuel gauge odometer and accessory lights such as engine temp and light on indicators | Should be enlarged by at least one font size | It would be a bad thing if your engine over heat light comes on but the darn indicator bulb is so tiny that you never see it | Love the over-all appearance of the Yaris over anything else out their in this same size class of car | 
 "words": I traded in a fully loaded Camry for my Yaris and have not regretted it for one moment | Not quite as powerful acceleration but the gas mileage more than makes up for it and I'm not in that big of a hurry anyway | I can still enter the freeway without causing everyone behind me to stack up |

 "words": I feel the greatest value in this car is found in the base models and that people who want more options would be better served with the Honda Fit | That being said I love my Yaris | Mine has the dealer-installed TRD suspension parts springs shocks and rear sway bar | The package utterly transforms the cars ride and handling and gives it a Mini-like feel | The TRD package yields a very well balanced fun to drive car and I'l highly recommend it to any enthusiast | I also installed the leather wrapped TRD shift knob which flexes less than the factory rubberized plastic knob and yields a more direct feel to the shifter | Nice brakes nice steering acceptable seats lots of storage MPG |
