REVIEWS
 "words": We've had the Traverse about 5 months now and 5000 miles | No problems to date hasn't been back to the dealer and both my wife and I really like the car | I see a lot of posts about poor mileage but we have consistently got 20 to 22 mpg in mixed suburban driving which in my estimation is great for such a large car | My only regret is that I did not buy an LT2 or LTZ package to get some of he features like backup camera power folding mirrors temperature controlled climate controls and upgraded radio | People who ride in the car are surprized how quiet it is especially the engine hard to tell it's running | I don't think Chevy has gotten the credit it deserves for this engine | 
 "words": When driving my Traverse LTZ from home to the baseball field low milage slow acceleration slow downshift poor rear window visibility are very disappointing BUT when the 6 passenger seats are full with my kids their friends and their sport gadgets the cargo area is loaded with their NY Yankees jackets coolers one bike bats gloves and balls and cup holders are all booked then I realize that I did not make a mistake | Driving back home turns into a joyful experience | I appreciate the stability smooth and comfortable ride nice interior design amenities the vehicle has to offer room and the feeling of driving a safe vehicle for my family and their friends | 
 "words": We traded in an '06 Cadillac DTS | this rides every bit as smooth | Retired but wanted the room to haul things it's sort of our car truck | Lots of cargo space | Love the Bose sound system great bass | Remote rear hatch is convenient the fact we can change it to manual which allows us to open in the garage | The head rests were uncomfortable but just turned them around and they're fine | Cup holders are nice size | storage areas are adequate | Fuel economy is good considering my DH doesn't do gradual stops and tends to lead foot on take off | even then we're getting avg | 20 mpg city hwy | A 75 mi | trip of 60 75 mph combined averaged 26mpg | and a 158 mi hilly day trip-avg'd 22 mpg | 
 "words": Bought the Traverse after a lot of research considering primarily import SUV's | Poor experience with Nissan Pathfinder and support lead me back to a NA product | Dealer was very attentive and worked with me to get the right vehicle at the right price | 
 "words": Very impressed with this vehicle | Still own a 1998 Malibu and traded in our 2002 Venture | If I could only own 1 vehicle this would be it | It does it all it really shines on the highway | Good riding height and has a substantial presence on the road which helps with the big truck traffic | Around town is is very nimble and my average fuel economy is 20 | 1 at the moment which I think is pretty good for a 4700 pound 281 HP vehicle | The exterior styling is really one of the coolest crossovers made | I get a lot of comments about it and it makes most other vehicles look like antiques | Overall very pleased with this purchase and hope to keep it for a long long time | 
 "words": After owning only Honda Toyota Nissan in the past I finally bought it because the 3rd row has easiest access of all SUV's with 3rd row we saw | It just seems American cars don't put the effort into designing things like foreign | Ran out of space for dislikes below Hood release lines up vertically with parking break I've unlatched it couple times -suv sways hard to describe on roads that are banked -2nd row seating tracks are exposed food debris can fall in the track -clothe hangers line up with back of 2nd row clothe can't hang right -suv refuses to downshift | you have to give it a lot of gas before it gets it | -only 1 lever for wipers turn beams etc continued below
 "words": I currently have 10500 miles on my Traverse and I'm pretty happy with the comfort performance and gas mileage the car has been getting | I drove a Tahoe before this and it's just as roomy and it gets better mileage | It's my first AWD car and I notice slipping when turning corners and rollback on inclines | Wondering if this is normal | 
 "words": We bought our traverse in June2009 | The headrests are very uncomfortable and force a short person to keep their head bowed if they don't put a pillow behind their back | My husband has nearly wrecked it three times when trying to make a left hand turn due to the poor visibility when looking to the right to see if another vehicle is coming | It is hard to park because you cannot see the front end and it's very hard to back up due to the small window and the many blind spots along the sides we have the economy model | The gas mileage is awful | We took a long trip and the highway mpg never got above 18 mpg | My biggest concern is safety | It is an accident waiting to happen | 
 "words": Since I have purchased foreign made cars over the past few years I was hesitant of getting back into the market for a domestic made automobile | We have been very happy with this vehicle | Gas mileage was a little disappointing at first but with mileage on car the mpg has improved to at least what the advertisement claims and at times a little better | I will gladly take a bit of inconvenience with the transmission shifting or not shifting especially for the mpg's | 
 "words": I have owned my 2009 Traverse LTZ since Feb | 2009 | I love everything about it except one thing | The bad news is that one thing was the primary reason I bought the vehicle | The Traverse is advertised as getting 18mpg in the city and 24mpg on the highway | I am getting nowhere near that | My combined mpg has been 17 | 4mpg with roughly 50-50 city highway mix | This is AFTER driving like I am 80 years old | I have never owned a vehicle so far below EPA mileage estimates | This is ridiculous | Otherwise an outstanding vehicle | I am getting 19to20 mpg on the highway and 15to16 mpg in the city | 
 "words": I downsized from my Tahoe | I can confidently say this vehicle is the best I have ever owned | I do a lot of traveling for my company and the room in this vehicle accomodates for my stuff very easily | It is also extremely comfortable on those long road trips | I would definently reccomend this to anyone in the crossover market | 
 "words": This car is quiet and fun to drive | I love the DVD system with the wireless headphones for the kids | The interior space is not much smaller than my Ford Expedition that I traded in | I actually have more cargo room while all 7 seats are up than before | 
 "words": Should have stayed Ford decided to try Chevy very disappointed with the performance and reliability | The Check engine light has come on over 7 times in less than 6 months first few times they said the gas cap was not put on properly | Over 35 yrs of driving time I know how to put a gas cap on | The 4th time a fuel injector was replaced the 5th time back to Gas cap 6th time they replaced a coil and spark plugs 7th time yep you guessed it Gas Cap | We like this vehicle we are not happy with the performance we got a lemon working with GM to get it replaced | I know Good Luck | GM had their chance going back to Ford especially if they give me my money | Should've have stayed FORD | 
 "words": We purchased the 09 Traverse LTZ after comparing GMC Buick to other brands | Traverse seems to be the best value of the group | I can't wait to drive it on longer trips to experience all the features it has to offer | Comfort is much like sitting in a minivan so that you are not tired when you finish a trip | 
 "words": Took my Traverse with only 180 miles on it out to South Dakota on a 3600 mi trip with absolutely no problems four adults and luggage everybody as comfortable gas mileage averaged 20 | 9 for the whole trip | More mileage on the vehicle the better the mileage | Could not have been happier with the vehicle | 
 "words": This fun-to-drive crossover has it all for a small family that will expand | Captain's chairs in second row perfect for a child seat third row perfect for driving family around with your kids | Drives like a car with great acceleration for a heavy vehicle | All you would need with a family in back | Punch it and there's a bit of torque- steer | Not recommended with family in car | Bose stereo is great and all controls easy to navigate | Remote rear hatch very helpful and very good storage with third-row seats down | With a full car good idea to purchase storage container for top of vehicle or extra storage on the hitch | Overall very satisfied with vehicle's mpg 18 city 25 hwy | Rview camera a | 
 "words": I didn't think an American-made car could feel so luxurious | The interior is spacious and very comfortable with lots of leg room even in the third row seating area | I love all of the storage compartments in the front driver's area too | The seats fold and move very easily to make more space for hauling when necessary | The back- up sensors and camera are great | My biggest complaint is the size of the buttons for turning A C on or off front or rear defrost on off etc | There's a cluster of 8 buttons and if you don't know just where the button is you're going for it's a bit confusing and takes your attention from the road for a moment | Overall fun to drive and I'm enjoying it | 
 "words": We've had our Traverse for over two weeks and it certainly shows the quality that American car manufacturers can showcase once again | We purchased a loaded 2LT and the ride quality is outstanding | The cabin is incredibly quiet even with the sunroof opened | Our other vehicle is a 2007 PT Cruiser and the Traverse is doing nearly the same gas mileage of that small car | We're averaging 18 | 6 MPG with a heavy amount of in-town driving | When calculating the mileage with all the horsepower the Traverse has I can see that if you are quick to take off at a green light you can easily lower your MPG greatly | For the size of the vehicle the fuel economy is good | 
 "words": I bought this SUV over a Toyota Highlander because I could negotiate a better price I had 3500 worth of GM card points to further reduce the price | I also favored this vehicle over the Highlander because 1 it seats 8 not 7 | 2 it has greater cargo room ESPECIALLY when the rear seat is up | and 3 the seats split 60 40 so that one can go on vacation comfortably seat 5 still have room for luggage | As an owner I have my concerns disappointments | One of them is MPG consistently around 15 | 5 mpg | My wife's Sienna van gets 20 mpg under same conditions | You need to evaluate for yourself these awkward features 1 headrests | 2seat comfort adjust ability | 3 rear visibility | 
 "words": I had been a Minivan Mom for 7 years | I have three kids and each with two sports activities | Loved my minivan but wanted something different | I looked at the Mazda Cx-9 Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot | NOTHING compared with the Traverse | It fits eight passengers with comfort It is easy to drive although I was somewhat intimidated at first and handles like a car and much better than my Minivan | Attn Soccer Moms out there looking to move into a Crossover | This is the SUV | Kids love it | PS I saved money by getting the LT1 model and had the dealership wrap the seats in leather and install the DVD | Came out beautiful | 
 "words": traded in Ford Explorer for Traverse | I was very happy with my Explorer and thus far the Traverse is a much more enjoyable | The interior comfort drive is nicer | I purchased the captains chairs for the second row | With 2 young children it is much more efficient to access the 3rd row | getting just under 18 mpg city | 
 "words": My family and I 3 kids needed something that could fit our needs but we do not like Mini-vans | This traverse is IT | It looks like a crossover handles like a SUV but has the features of a minivan | The room and captains chairs are great for the younder kids the oldest loves having the rear seat to herself | My wife and I have room in front and it is a safe handling vehicle as well | Very good work went into this vehicle to meet the needs of the family of today | 
 "words": Traded in my 07 Yukon Toy hauler and gas guzzler for this surprisingly fuel efficient roomy toy hauler | I have been very happy so far with the performance handling and towing capacity | It is almost as roomy as the Yukon was inside from a driving and cargo perspective | All this with a 5-6 mile per gallon improvement | I am a big personso I needed the leg room and seat support and the traverse has met this demand rather easily | So far big thumbs up | 
 "words": Front headrests are VERY uncomfortable | The 2nd row bench seating can be moved forward and back we thought this was great until we realized the the track it runs on creates a little crevice on the floor | We've lost kids DS games in there not to mention the stuff that is getting stuck in there | Also when moving the seat to get to third row it crushes the mat on the floor it does not accommodate for that bad design | The car drives great on the highway but does not shift down very smoothly making city driving a little jerky | We almost bought the Ford Flex and are having buyer's remorse | Traverse still kinda looks like our old van on the outside | 
 "words": Vehicles is easy and fun to drive | Easy to park and get in and out of | I only wish I had listened to some other reviews on the bad gas mileage | I was expecting to get at least 15 miles a gallon since it is rated to get 17 in the city | But I am so dissapointed I that I get 12-13 mpg in the city | I see others say that they get great gas mileage and others say they are getting very bad mileage like me | So maybe I got stuck with one of the bad ones 
 "words": We bought our Chevy Traverse LTZ on January 2 2009 | We bought this because it was very similar to our Cadillac SRX which was also fully loaded and it actually has a real 3rd row | We did some research and found that the safety rating was perfect and the airbag system was top of the line | We wanted this to be our family vehicle | However within two weeks of our purchase we made a cross country trip to Chicago for a family members funeral I don't fly and always drive | That's when I first notice our CHECK AIRBAG SYSTEM warning light came on | Well to make a long story short | This problem has happened 5 times and they have made repair attempts and the problem still occurs | See Below | 
 "words": Bought this to replace hubby's 10-year old Chrysler Sebring convertible | Hubby is 6'4 fits well in the car | He loves everything about it | I am a bit pickier | Overall it drives well is mostly comfy front head rests annoying has great storage for our 2 small kids w car seats a stroller in back | I drive a 2004 Toyota RAV4 base model there are things my RAV has that this doesn't like cup holders that adjust this car has lots of cup holders but only 2 hold a 20 oz | bottle stereo controls on the steering wheel a cargo cover | Spare tire jack cost 75 extra on the Chevy | Would still buy again because we couldn't afford anything more | Cargo space is worth it | 
 "words": We have only had our Traverse for a couple of weeks but we love it so far | It is great for our family of 5 as we traded in a Yukon XL | The only issue which isn't much is the transmission but nothing is perfect | Love the ride comfort captains chairs and interior styling | The wife wanted an Acadia but she is very happy with the Traverse | Hopefully we won't be disappointed down the rode | Happy so far | 
 "words": We where in the market to replace our Mini Van and did not want another | We also did not like the Large SUV's so the Chevy traverse cross over was the perfect fit | It comfortable fits 8 and has room for our junk | 
 "words": I bought my Traverse in November of 08 | Extremely happy with the car at first but after 6 months you begin to realize the faults and what makes it a Chevrolet | I love the versatility of the car and love the way it drives | At first I really enjoyed the interior but after you get to know it you realize there is a lot of plastic used in the car | Paying full price for the LTZ it would be nice to have leather in places where there is plastic | 
 "words": I'm really impressed with this car | If you are like I was and couldn't stand the fact you are driving a minivan but needed the passenger capacity I have a wife five young kids and a disabled live-in-mother-in-law give this vehicle a test drive | It's relatively affordable fun to drive and in no way do you ever feel like you're in a minivan | Well done GM | 
 "words": New Traverse LT2 owners | Out grew our 5 passenger SUV as we needed more passenger and cargo space | Researched a lot of vehicles including Honda Pilot Toyota Highlander Saturn Outlook etc | This vehicle was by far our favorite | It has a great design is very comfortable drives like a car instead of an SUV or minivan and gave us the most features for our money | It feels like a luxury vehicle without the luxury vehicle price tag | We are glad to have an American made vehicle especially one as fun as this | Welcome back Chevy | 
 "words": I have driven my 09 Traverse for 1 month and the first thing I notice everytime I drive it is the great stable ride and the level of quietness | I have the XM satelite radio in the 2LT with the 10 speaker Bose sound system | Also a great feature | Acceleration is terrific the electric T gate with this model is something I got used to immediately | Front and rear a s and heat cools it down fast | Tilt and telescoping steering wheel electric lumbar pan and seat backcustomizes the sitting experience | Glass is free of distortions reverse sensers and camera monitoring have come to good use many times | A great vehicle and it looks great in dark blue met | 
 "words": We just purchased the Traverse last week | I am very disappointed in the ride and the design of the seats | I feel every bump in the road | The headrest on the seats points forward such that I hit my head on it with every bump | There is no way to adjust it or the seat to stop this from happening | The compartment on the dash board is worthless too small to store much of anything and right in the sun to get hot | The back up camera is a necessity because you can't see much with the rear view mirror | 
 "words": Everyone talks about the driving but as a passenger Ill review other things | First of all the dash is well put together | Buttons and stuff is very easy to use | Then there's the ride and interior | Its comfortable and quiet but the captains chairs can be uncomfortable some times | Then there's maintenance | The Traverse is easy to clean | Ours is Black with an Ebony leather interior so it shows the red dirt | But it comes off EXTREMELY easily | Also even though its big cleaning the roof and windshield is easy too | So overall a great car | 
 "words": I love to drive this the backup camera is a great help | I like everything about the inside | We were looking at the Venza and bought this one because it is styled better has a 3rd row and American built | 
 "words": WE have only owned the 2009 Chevrolet TRaverse LTZ a couple weeks | We love it so far | We still need to learn all the tricks with navigation and bluetooth phone but those are great features along with the cooled seats in hot Florida | We hope it is as reliable long term as we have too many gadgets to want to fix them | Only complaint so far is getting used to the many gears as it seems to downshift just as you go around an intersection wehre you don't completely stop but then accelerate after going around the turn | We had a Ford Taurus that did that many years ago | 
 "words": I have only driven German cars for the last 25 years lifestyle change took me to a top of the line Tahoe 3 years ago and while it was a good car it was too 'trucky' so was heading back to Deutschland | Until our Chevy sales guy enticed me to drive the Traverse | A month later I am in love | Have put 2000 miles on it with no problems | It holds a large amount of stuff as well as 4 humans | It handles well is comfortable and we are getting 18 mpg in town and the promised 24 on the road | GM has a chance if this is a sample of their future | 
 "words":  After my purchase I drove the Traverse on a 2000 mile trip to Washington state via the Calif | coast highway | The Traverse averaged almost 19 M | P | G | highway and almost 13 M | P | G | around town | This mileage has remained the same after almost 5000 miles on the vehicle and my Chevrolet dealer says that all is fine and all is NORMAL | The mileage is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E and what is worseI can't do anything about it | I continue to pay for a fuel efficient vehicle and in reality can't afford to drive this GAS GUZZLER | Chevrolet is somewhat less than honest with their mileage estimates | I wish Chevy had this vehicle back and I had a REAL car | Chevy's ads should be illegal | 
 "words": Lots of good features but safety and reliability are my main concern so when I discovered that my brand new traverse not an inexpensive vehicle does not include a spare tire a donut or even a place to attach one I was shocked | It doesn't really matter that onstar can send help if you have a flat | If you have no tire and have to towed what are the occupants of this 7 passenger vehicle to do | wait by the side of the road | taxi's are often not available in rural areas | For this kind of money I am just appalled that gm would even produce a vehicle without BASIC family saftey items such as a spare tire | Moms families beware of the danger of being stranded at all times | 
 "words": traded in my 08 Tahoe because having alot of problems with it | Thought the Traverse looked cool but the only seat that is comfortable is the drivers seat and gas mileage thus far has been well below advertised 12-14 mpg in city | I see others say they get better mpg so hopefully it will get better over time | 
 "words": Being a past Honda Toyota Girl all of my life I was skeptical about an American car | Test drove the Honda Pilot Toyota Highlander Pacifica and finally decided to try a Chevrolet went to test drive the Equinox and saw the Traverse and fell in love | Once I drove it I KNEW this was the car for us | My husband and I both recently retired so we are ready to travel | Rides like a dream quiet and so comfortable | We love being in our Traverse so much that after three months we already have five thousand miles on it | Go USA | 
 "words": As a former Tahoe and Suburban owner we were looking for something more economical but with much of the flexibility we had enjoyed with our prior SUV | We recently completed a 2700 mile trip tp Montana and averaged 21 miles per gallon | This car is very quite smooth and fun to drive | We were quite amazed by the acceleration of the 6 cylinder engine with the car containing 4 adults and the back stacked high with luggage | 
 "words": Just finished our 2000 mile family vacation | I agree with the reviews about the hesitating downshift on the transmission | It can be annoying when passing and I'm not towing anything | The ride quality rocks and there is tons of room | I wished I would have sucked it up and gotten the AWD but I got cheap | DO NOT BUY THIS CAR WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA | It's a big car with a tiny rear window | If you don't have the camera you just can't see anything | 
 "words": I own a Mercedes S 550 and am sorry I did not buy the Traverse first | The Mercedes would still be in Germany after all the issues | The Traverse is a dream and the storage space is unbelievable | Chevy finally gets it | 
 "words": Great Car | High level of quality similar to a luxury car | Looked at Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander the Traverse beat them all | Pilot and Highlander are over-rated | Friends who are owners of these vehicles drove in my Traverse and commented they liked this car better | This could very well be the start of the New GM | 
 "words": The Traverse is actually better than I expected | Quiet on the road and you can't tell that the engine is running sometimes unless you check the tach | Wife tried to start it several times while it was running | no problem it locks out the starter | Very good power although apparently the transmission has been optimized for mileage at 60 mph it's running at only 1600 RPM so it's slightly sluggish until it downshifts out of 6th gear | The mileage is MUCH better than I expected getting 21-22 mpg in suburban driving and the advertised 24 mpg on the highway | That seems remarkable for such a big car | Overall it's at least the equal of it's competitors such as the Highlander or Pilot | 
 "words": This vehicle has everything I want in a car | Several people have commented on it's looks and functionality | Fun to drive and rides beautifully on the highway | GM has produced a winner here | If they turn out a few more cars of this quality they should have no trouble surviving their tough times |

 "words": Have owned car for 3 months very stylish outside | Have LT1 version interior seats are very nice though a bit uncomfortable especially for your lower back | No carpet in the back seats basically a big floor mat latched down | I get 20 | 2 MPG | My biggest problem with the car is the location of the oil filter | I have changed oil on dozens of vehicles new and old but never had to change the filter from the top of the engine | There is not enough room to place a filter wrench on the filter it took 3 hrs for 3 men to unloose the initial high torqued filter by hand | When the filter was loosened it went all over other components located underneath the filter | Otherwise a great car and roomy |

 "words": We are a family that does a lot of traveling due to being military and far from home | We looked at many vehicles and this was a great selection for safety and gas mileage | The vehicle is really comfortable and my children love the space and comfort while traveling | We were reluctant to get a minivan so this seemed to be the perfect fit because it looked sleek yet had many nice minivan qualities | We seriously considered the Acadia but this was a better price point and very similar to the Acadia | Overall I think it is a great choice for families who are resistant to getting a minivan but still want the safety and decent gas mileage | 
 "words": This is a perfect family vehicle | Our new Chevy traverse is awesome | It was love at first sight | The smooth drive the panoramic view the cargo space safety features were definite selling points | We have always purchased GM vehicles and have always been satisfied with their performance dependability | We still have our 1999 Suburban w 200000 milesit looks runs great | we're hoping to say the same thing about our Traverse in 10 years | Looking forward to enjoying family trips with our grandchildren
