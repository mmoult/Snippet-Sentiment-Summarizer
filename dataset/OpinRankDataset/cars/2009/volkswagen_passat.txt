REVIEWS
 "words": Own this car for one month | It is truly fun to drive Passat compare to other imports | Love the look inside and out | It drives like 6 cylinder car thanks to turbo | Consequently it consumes gas like 6 cylinder | I average 22 to 23 mi gallon on 60 freeway 40 local | My old 2000 Maxima was better than that | I had to check the car with a local dealership for rattling noise from driver side glove box and door panel | It was fixed once and came back | So it's been at service twice for the same issue | Hope this problem won't come back | 
 "words": Super vehicle especially for the price | Standard features build quality and performance is something I would expect in a much higher end vehicle The turbo makes the gas pedal like a hair trigger on a gun the attention to detail and quality materials is far superior to this cars competition | Something as simple as an umbrella storage compartment built into the drivers door are the small touches that really make the vehicle a standout aside from what Ive mentioned | 
 "words": This car is smooth quiet and comfy | My wife daughter and I are looking forward to getting out on the open road with this | This car breezes down the local freeway and streets effortlessly | Handline is precise crisp and drives rock solid like a heavier car | The only real drawback thus far is the lack of bluetooth which is optional on Passat but comes standard in other cars | Other than that it could use a bit more power but for a mid size sedan the fuel economy and power are both excellent | Comfortable plenty of leg room for a 6'5 driver with some to spare | 
 "words": Two months after purchase I was at the service station due to some rattling sound coming from my front bumper | Come to find out that something was coming loose | The following month I was at the service station again due to a hissing sound that comes on each initial pull out | After these issues were fixed for free of-course I have enjoyed every ounce of my car | Everyone who sees my Passat all say the same thing | wow your car is beautiful | Some think its a BMW at first sight while some say they never ever considered a VW until seeing mine | German engineering rocks but they need to understand that Americans love comfort and convenience together with reliability | 
 "words": This is my 3rd generation Passat and my 5th VW car in the last 25 years | I have owned also recent models of Nissan Maxima Toyota Camry and Honda Accord | I have driven during my business trips in Europe various Mercedes cars C200 and E300and BMW 300 500 series | Similarly I drove in USA Lexus and Infinity midsize sedans | I find the Passat the most sensible combination of performance comfort and value | You get Audi engineering on par with BMW and Mercedes at discount price | The gas mileage 34-35 miles galon is better than that of my Toyota Camry 2005 XLE 4 | As for the reliability it is better than my Camry 2005 so far 
 "words": Bought this car on the basis of owning a 2006 jetta was not disappointed | The fuel mileage meets or exceeds the epa sticker2l | 4 cyl drives like a larger engine | 
 "words": VW Passat is a great feat of German engineering | Autobahn for all after all - The exterior is to fall in love for interior is good and minimalistic too but the drive feel | The steering is speed sensitive and I absolutely loved it | But | The speedometer has small numbers on it that are hard to read so it's not clear from a quick glimpse on it whether you're making 60 or 70 km h | The transmission is lovely very responsive and seamless | You really cannot feel it but the engine is unrefined | Usually I'm a big fan of smaller engines because of their efficiency and almost limitless possibilities for improvement | But turbo lag kills me | Not responsive at all and jolty | 
 "words": I needed to move into a larger car | Previous car was 2003 Jetta TDI sedan and I really loved it | It got great mileage and was fun to drive but not quite large enough for a growing family | We decided on the Passat Wagon because we were in no way getting a minivan nor SUV | We wanted the performance and handling of a car and not the bulk or stigma of a van or SUV | It was down to the Passat or Subaru Outback | In the end we went with the Passat as VW bank was offering 60 mos at 0 | While there may be posts out there complaining about quality we've not seen any issues yet | The same issues were reported for my Jetta and over 5 years few of those issues ever arose | 
 "words": I love the way this car drives | It drives better than most 6 cyl vehicles I've driven | The interior knobs have a somewhat cheap-looking appearance | Overall a good bang for your buck | 
 "words": In general a reasonable price performance ratio | The reliability is bad automatic windows brakes and instrument panel are replaced | 
 "words": This is our third Passat having bought a new 1997 diesel and 2004 diesel | We love the diesels but gave up on VW ever getting the Passat diesel into North America | VW always seems to be three steps behind the marketing curve | We are quite pleased with our 2009 even though it isn't a diesel and we certainly miss that mileage | It handles beautifully but is noisier than our 2004 due to the low profile tires | We bought new tires and went one size up and the noise decreased | Our big gripe is that VW dropped Homelink from the Passat but not the Passat CC | Another braindead action by VW | Their response to my inquiry Our marketing plan for North America does not include the diesel or Homelink | 
 "words": This car is really a pleasant surprise | Just came out of an Infinity M45 | Had to downsize lifestyle and found the perfect car | This car drives greatand is big enough for a family of five | No car can match the features this car has for the money | 
 "words": I recently bought a VW Passat 'Komfort' wagon for my wife | The car has been great so far | After 5 days in my Lexus it's fun to drive my wife's car on the weekend | I really can't ever say I've felt that way about my other cars | If VW can solve some of it's past reliability issues and it looks like they are trying hard to do so I think middle America will 'rediscover' the brand | 
 "words": Great mileage super low emissions big enough to carry lots of junk quiet for a diesel | Acceleration leaves a lot ot be desired
 "words": Outstanding engineering safety and quality | Fantastic value | Excellent purchase experience | Free scheduled maintenance for 3 years | Fun to drive | Getting 34 mpg at 70 mph | VW is the new BMW | 
 "words": I have a BMW X5 and traded a Merc C280 4 Matic for the Passat | The Passat is the exact size of an E350 but half the price | You give up rain sensing wipers memory seats automatic headlights and a power rear sunshade | You get just as good build quality similar performance in crash tests 10 more MPG free scheduled maintenance for 3 years and 30000 in your pocket | The sales experience was much better than Mercedes | I have no regrets | I love this car | What will I do with my 30000 | Good time to invest | 
 "words": So far very few problems with 09 Passat compared to 06 previously owned | Small rattle ipod adapter issue dealership addressed immediately | 3200 miles driven since purchased | Keep checking my oil to make sure don't have same issue as 06 model | Fun to drive compared to Nissan Honda and Toyota family sedans | Unfortunately my experience is that you trade performance fit finish for reliability | Keeping my fingers crossed | 
 "words": Came out of a Volvo XC70 | This car has personality and is much more fun to drive | Comfort is good | Good acceleration | Mileage is better then sticker | Easily get 30-32 at 70 mph | 33-34 at 60 mph | Average fuel mileage is 26mpg | Kids love the rear door window shade | I am 6'1 and like the front seats | Live in area that doesn't have may Passat Wagons and get many looks |
