REVIEWS
 "words": Have now owned my Patriot for nine months | This vehicle is better than expected | Drives much better than my previous vehicle with was a Forester | The new interior design on the 09 really makes you feel like your driving a luxury crossover | Once you learn how to drive the CVT is becomes very smooth and a joy to drive | I did have the dreaded front dome light leak in April i brought it in they replaced a seal and after a record breaking amount of rainfall over the summer I have not had any other problems with it | Once the CVT gets broken in a little gas mileage improves | I now average about 25 | 5 on the highway on long trips and 22 city | Pretty good for a 4x4 | 
 "words":  Had it since it for about 9 months now and so far love it got it with sunroof and speed control | Is very fun to drive and very stable | I read some of the other reviews and agree with some but some others do not agree | The gas tank is too small I agree Roomy is yes there is a delay when you put in gear before it engages | It being to low to the ground No it is prefect | The sounds system is great | Have not really noticed the seat adjustment be to far in or out | The 17 wheels have very good traction even with a 2 wheel drive | 
 "words": We have 5500 miles on it and it averages about 25mpg all around | We bought the Limited FWD with the sun roof | and yep it leaked | We took it back to the dealer and they replaced it | Hope that fixed it | Drives great fun to drive and looks good | We got the extended warranty Max thought it a good deal | All in all its been a great car | gets down the road great | 
 "words": I have been buying Toyota's for many years now | This is my first American car | I have test drove a few other SUV before buying this jeep | I tested the Volkswagen Tiguan Suzuki Grand Vitara Mitsubishi Outlander and the Suburu Forester | All theses SUV have great 4x4's | The Honda element and CRV have weak 4x4 system and the RAV4 is too narrow inside for my big stature | So it came down to the Outlander and the Jeep | Well it turn out that the Outlander and the Patriot have the same CVT transmission and motor 2 | 4lcalled the World Motor design by Chrysler Mitsubishi and Hyundai | I decided on the Jeep because handle bump's a little better I tough than the Outlander | More quiet inside too | 
 "words": Bought the first one between snowstorms was very impressed with the combination of 4WD traction and stability control | Traded the old Wrangler for the second Patriot because we liked the first Patriot so much we were fighting over who got to drive it | Both have sunroofs a great sound system and 17inch Wrangler tires with alloy wheels | The bells and whistles are well worth it | The autoshift works fine for fast acceleration but it takes a little to get used to | Put it into 6th for flat highway driving and get better gas mileage | We especially like the lower road clearance better stability and plenty high enough if you don't go off- road and it's still higher than a car
 "words": My Not Clunker was a 1989 Jeep Cherokee Laredo that I hated to part with | A Dealer found a 4X4 Patriot Sport D with CVT1 two weeks into the program and I was able to get 8000 of the price | A no brainer | They had 55 before but were all gone | It is not trail rated and my first 1000 miles has seen 5 on dirt roads in the hills | Does the ESP eat up gas mileage | Since it is a Sport D I had to install skid plates hitch package roof rack for kayaks bikes | Planing next year for lift kit 17 wheels and AT tires front bumper with winch | It is a Jeep and will be treated as one | It has been a Jeep so far but more off road tests yet to come | I expect good performance from this Patriot | 
 "words": Small interior blind spots unheated mirrors that fog up front seats that heat but aren't power sliders for seats stick out way too far and could cause injury | Not much pep in the engine | Oh and did I mention the 13 1 2 gallon fuel tank | Way too small | SUV sits way too low to the ground I thought I was in a sports car not an SUV | I am a tall female who half the time cannot reach the controls of the sun roof | Does it sound like I am happy | Should have walked away from the deal | Next time I will buy another make or spend more money on a real Jeep | 
 "words": I have a tendency get into the gas a little | I'm not sure the cvt can take it | After a few quick starts I could smell rubber burning | Fortunately guarantee is lifetime | I've backed off the gas lately afraid to kill this tranny in a few months | I would like to hear from other's that hit the gas a little and have the Patriot with the cvt | 
 "words": We just picked up our new patriot 09 limited sun and sound package on 8 5 09 and noticed our 1st leak water pouring out of the front Dome Light about 2 weeks later 1st rain storm | Come to find a Recall was issued by Chrysler on 8 7 09 for the same issue | Everything else is great about the jeep but i've already had to take it in to have the leak issue looked at | Dealer claims to have resolved the issue by clearing a drain in the sun room | Judging by the many online posts on this issue the same leak or a new one is likely to return | I would suggest that if you are in the market for a new patriot to at the very least take it through the car wash a couple times on the test drive | 
 "words":  I wanted an economical SUV that was still comfortable for a 6'3 guy with hip and back problems | The Clunker program w the Chrysler rebate made picking the Patriot a no-brainer | The published reviews made me think I was settling for this car | but after three tanks full I'm very happy with my choice | I drove all day with three passengers yesterday and the guys in the backseat were comfortable | I'm satisfied with the engine performance and the CV auto too | I attached a small fish-eye mirror to the corner of the passenger side mirror and that helps w the blind spot | I'm not crazy about the poor angle of upward visibility for a tall driver with the seat up and back | 
 "words": So far I really like my Patriot | I traded in a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer in the cash for clunkers program and got 8000 off with the additional 3500 off from Jeep which was a great deal | It's taken some getting used to losing lots of the extras that my Mountaineer had that this car doesn't have such as automatic lights on off and power seats etc | but over all it is a great little SUV | It does get about 21 MPG however it has a very small gas tank | I drive about 300 miles or more per week so I am at the gas station at least every four days and that is getting old | Also if you are used to a V8 or a V6 use caution for the first month or so when pulling out in traffic | 
 "words": Cashed in a Ford Explorer for the Patriot and could not be happier | After 2 tanks of gas I am averaging 27 mpg and am very impressed with the performance and how quiet the engine runs | I went with the 5 speed and it has great pick up I had not heard great reviews about the performance of the cvv automatic |

 "words": Living Houston and the horrible commutes to and from work this little Jeep does pretty well with an average of 19 | 8 mpg | Even though it is a little sluggish from a stop it is a very light and responsive vehicle that really climbs up the speedometer fast | The roominess of the cabin great and sits comfortably with plenty of leg room to spare | The Life Time warranty on the power train is the best around | The in-dash compass and audible signals for gas and oil change are handy | The Sirius radio navigation system Blue Tooth etc | in this device are very nice additions in | creature features | It has a | Brilliant Black Crystal Pearlcoat | which really shimmers in the sunlight | Very nice Jeep |
