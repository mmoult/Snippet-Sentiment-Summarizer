REVIEWS
 "words": This is a smart vehicle and one of the best buy in current auto market | I got the sport A at a price 2K lower than many midsize sedan sold in my area like camry accord and altima | The 5 is very functional with a combination of minivan and samll SUV | However I have to admit that some stuff needs to be improved | For example the front AC wind direction is hard to adjust I prefer the design of camry in this case | 
 "words": After having our first baby in June and we decided it was time for a family vehicle | She wasn't sold on the 5 at first because she likes her small sporty sedans | I knew all along that what she wants is no longer practical so I let her test drive the Mazda 3 first | Reality set in when we put the baby seat in the back of the 3 | Our leg room was definitely compromised | Next we test drove the 5 and she quickly realized the 5 was most practical for our new family | This was a tough one considering my father is a retired GM employee and am eligible for the GM discount | We wanted a vehicle suits our needs now and is fuel efficient | Unfortunately GM doesn't carry a vehicle like the 5
 "words": I purchased our Mazda 5 sport about a month ago with a Cash for Clunkers deal trading in a Kia Sedona | I wanted better gas mileage and we didn't need quite as much space but I didn't want to give up being able to carry extra people or lots of stuff | This car was the perfect choice | I took it on a 600 mile trip a few days after I got it | We had no problem fitting my family and all of our stuff in it and when we got there we were able to fit the other family traveling with us in for short trips | My worst mpg so far has been 23 mpg around town on the first tank of gas | My best was 33 mpg mostly highway driving on our trip | I have been averaging around 26 mostly around town driving | 
 "words": My wife and I are expecting our second child in a few weeks and we're happy to have found the Mazda5 just in time | It's perfect for our growing family and the price is right | It looks way better than other minivans and is surprisingly roomy inside | I usually don't like driving all that much but I find myself looking for reasons to drive the M5 | Oh yeah and our 2 year old loves it too | 
 "words": Test drove a KIA Sedona first roomy good engine plenty of utility but the seats KILLED my lower back more road noise than expected drove a little wide and the fuel consumption turned me off | Tried a KIA Rondo | It's more comfy but the 3rd row is a joke | Tried the Mazda5 QUIETER than Sedona comfy seats handling is WOW took the road bumps well mileage saves me 1200 yr in gas compared to minivan | Highway is little noisy but better with whole family | 3rd row is decent with LEGROOM 2nd row adjusts | Perfect for small family and grandpa can tag along inside | Rides nicer than Mazda3 | Kids love the windows | Brakes VERY well | I hear it eats tires so inflate and rotate | 
 "words": I purchased my 09 Mazda 5 one year ago when the first 09's arrived at the dealership | I have 12000 miles on the car now | Went from a dodge grand caravan to the mazda 5 | I needed a vehicle that got better mileage than the van wanted it to drive more like a car have flexible seating and be affordable | We are a family of 5 | I love the way the car drives handles | It gets good gas mileage 30 mpg highwayhas flexible and comfortable seating | With the hatchback it's even a great car for transporting our 2 big dogs | We will soon be purchasing a roof top carrier not a great amount of cargo space when the whole family is on a long trip | Why are there not more people driving Mazda 5's | Love Mine | 
 "words": I love this vehicle | Great for mom's with kids | Lots of space | Great price | 
 "words": We've been looking for a compact good on gas more than 5 pax vehicle and the Mazda5 is just that | The only vehicle that would come close to it's class is the Kia Rondo and IMO looks somewhat weird | So far the 5 has exceeded our expectations | Nice sporty styling great utility and standard features in this cute gas-sipper makes this vehicle an excellent value | Some people say that it's underpowered and probably is with a full load but it's more than adequate for my driving habits and the manual sport shift makes up for increased performance when needed | This 5 is fun to drive and you can't say that about a lot of minivans | We're very pleased with our 5 | 
 "words": Just picked up 2009 Touring a week ago | Love the utility for it's size | Have 2 children but no longer need to carry baby stuff | Need 3rd row seats once in a while | Drives like a car and is much better looking then a Kia Rondo | Like the rear doors | 
 "words": Just drove it off the lot this afternoon but have test drove it and been eyeing this car for almost 2 years | What can I say | I LOVE it | We have two children and will need to carpool in the fall | The kids love the captains seats and the fact that they can move around and stand up in the car when getting into their car seats | I love the gas mileage flexibility and 3rd row | I've read reviews that mention that it's underpowered and the interior feels a bit cheap | I'm no car expert but as a mom of two who travels around town with her kids it is perfect and super peppy for me | Plus the interior doesn't seem cheap at all | I'm loving every bit of this car | 
 "words": We have had our 5 since February and stumbled upon it accidentally after driving Hondas and Acuras forever | The CRV felt too big the Acura RSX was too pricey but the Mazda 5 was just right | Smooth ride easy to maneuver great sound system good gas mileage and very comfortable | Haven't had a minute's regret even when next to the CRV and Acura on the road | Thought it would pain my heart but I LOVE this car | Way to go Mazda | 
 "words":  and here's why | I've been researching a new car for about a year | Needed something for my 2 boys and I to get around town in | I went in knowing it would be small and it is and that's what's great | Drives like a car looks like a Matrix but better and adds the convenience of sliding doors | The back seats are Captain's chairs which makes getting to the third row a breeze | Adults CAN fit in the third row easily if they're not too tall so don't let that deter you | I paid 18600 for my Touring and you can't get a six-seater for any less | No power driver's seat but it's adjustable 3 ways so you can get it fairly comfortable | So cute | 
 "words": We had a sports sedan that just wasn't keeping up with the needs of a family but wanted to keep with a manual transmission | This was the only option out there with a 3rd row of seats and we're very happy with it | Plenty of cargo space great safety features peppy little engine that is seat-of-the-pants fun to drive good gas mileage and fantastic brakes | I always thought the crossover class was going in the wrong direction crossing a car and a SUV | This is a cross between a Mazda3 5-door and a van which surprisingly ends up with a best of a worlds feel | 
 "words": This a fun car to drive easy to park | I like to be able to haul stuff and people | It works well with my teenager on trips also easy for my mom to get in and out of | I am a fan of the captian seats and negotiated leather seats in my deal for ease of maintenance | Have taken 2 road trips the seats could be a little more cushy driving for 12hours and do not leave the AC in the rotating interior air position or the AC will freeze up and not work | You have to then let it unfreeze | If I had read the owners manual more closely it is in there | I can't see spending 25-30K on a vehicle though not perfect I think this is a great deal | I hope it lasts for many years to come | 
 "words": I am really enjoying our new Mazda5 but I am not overly amazed | It is a very small mini van | Our small umbrella stroller doesn't even fit | I know we will out grow this soon but it is fun for now | 
 "words": We purchased this a week ago and so far so good | I got tired of lugging around a big minivan at 15mpg local just to do mostly local errands little league lugging furniture from IKEA etc | My family of 3 takes a 3000 mile road trip every year or two and I did not want to sacrifice the comfort cargo area of a van | The Mazda 5 seems like the perfect solution | Better mileage sleeker drives more like a wagon than a van and I don't have to give up the cargo space I am used to having | I have used less than half a tank of gas so far and cannot yet evaluate the true mileage | Much easier to park than a full size van | 
 "words": I WAS a Saab fanantic until GM destroyed the brand | My last was a '99 | I bought and older MPV | I found myself driving the MPV mostly as I have a 4yo grandson who lives with me and 2 others I drive a lot | I passed down the MPV to my daughter and bought the 5 | I was sure I would like it as it is a form follows function design | remember when Saabs were | This car is an incredible performer with decent finish at a very low price | I was waiting to write this until I returned from a 6 day 1700 mi trip with my 4 year old | I am 6'2 and 280 and drove all those miles in reasonable comfort | It averaged 26mpg at 80mph | The bluetooth is simple and works well as well as all the other gadgets | 
 "words": The Mazda 5 is the MINI Van everyone wants to love my wife and were shopping for a MINI van and we test drove the Mazda 5 3 times plus borrowed my mothers Mazda 5 for a week and found that the Van wobbles at highway speed causing motion sickness problems for the passengers | The Mazda 3 has the same backend wobble as the Mazda 5 except it is more pronounced in the 5 | We found that the wobble is only noticeable at highway speeds however 90 of our driving is highway in short this wasn | t the van for us | 
 "words": We bought this car in Colorado and drove it Arkansas | It was great for me and my family | We have two kids 3 | 5 and 10 months | My wife sat comfortably in the back with the kid and luggage | We really packed this car down and still handled well | There are many way to configure the car and sitting six for short distances is great | For all the mini van haters the sliding doors are great for getting the kids in and out | Handling is great for a car this size | Overall great car for the money | Mazda has done well | We are really enjoying this purchase | 
 "words": Even though the car had good reviews I didn't want to drive it because well it's a minivan | So glad I saw it in person | It's so much cuter than a big ol' behemoth mini van | It's perfect | I'm hauling kids to college in 2 short years and I wanted something small enough to park and maneuver but with room for stuff | I knew sliders were great for little kids but it didn't occur to me until I took my mom to church how nice that access is for an elderly person too | My in town mileage has been around 24 | 5 mpg | The auto climate control is taking some getting used to | 
 "words": I was pretty skeptical that I would ever like a minivan but we love our Mazda 5 | I am amazed by how well it handles and how fun it is to drive | It doesn't have that big bloated feel and look of other minivans | We get better fuel economy than quoted for this vehicle | The good fuel efficiency and availability of a manual transmission is what sold us on this vehicle but we have been equally impressed with the utility and ride quality | It has a very nimble feel to it that makes you forget you are driving a van | 
 "words": I am really enjoying driving this car | It is fun and gas saving | I love how tight the steering is | 
 "words": Excellent car overall | Nice interior comfortable very pleasant exterior design good audio system | We love it | 
 "words": We have 3 kids and couldn't see affording 30000 for a new minivan or a cross-over | This car was much more affordable and will cost much less to maintain | It rides like a car but has a interior layout like a minivan | We won't be able to tow a boat or carry an 8' wide piece of plywood but we never did when we had that capability with our previous minivans | The kids love it but we haven't taken the first vacation in it yet so we may be sacrificing on space and power when the car gets fully loaded with luggage | I'm a tall guy and I push the limits on most cars | Leg room and head room could be better but I fit and I like the feel when I drive | 
 "words": I wanted to get a new sedan but also wanted to carry lots of luggage | It fit the bill | It is a great comfortable people items mover | and Touring comes with packages that is only found in expensive cars | Overall love it for what it does | 
 "words": I bought an '09 Sport model with AT and pearl paint for 17995 | My wife just loves the car | the four kids fit with no problem | The gas mileage is fantastic | 
 "words": I just got this car yesterday but I had another 5 as a loaner for a week before that so I'm pretty acquainted with the car's peculiarities at this point | We were looking at everything from small hatchbacks like the Honda Fit and Toyota Matrix to full-size minivans such as the Odyssey and Sienna but the Mazda5 seemed like the perfect fit for us it has plenty of space for a small family up to 2 kids easily | 3 would be fine until you have to go for a long trip it's relatively sporty and maneuverable and it's much more fuel- efficient than minivans | The kicker it's the only thing remotely minivan- like that offers a manual transmission | 
 "words": I've only just purchased this vehicle after exhaustive deliberations | While the Mazda 5 is a fine choice as a practical cheap do-it-all wagon construction is borderline flimsy and materials are cheap | My windshield creaks over every bump and the floor pedals and steering wheel all take turns vibrating as if the car had 100K miles on it and bad tires | I hope to resolve these issues soon | 
 "words": My family of 3 soon to be 4 needed to upgrade from our Civic to be able to carry two car seats some cargo and maybe grandma every now and then | We desperately did not want to end up in a mini van and despite what some categorize Mazda 5 as we love the sliding doors which allow pain-free baby loading into the car seat | Cargo room with the third row folded is sufficient but when the seats are up you can't even fit your groceries | Gas mileage is in the area of 24 MPG with mixed driving enough power to propel 4 adults and a baby on any road or hill | Highly recommended to those who need larger vehicle but want to remain environmentally friendly | 
 "words": I might be one of the only reviewers I have read and I've read TONS that does not have a family yet | I am almost thirty and was looking for a bigger car to accommodate more people in the future but also wanted something portable fun to drive with great gas mileage | I stumbled onto this car at the Mazda dealership and loved it | I had been interested in a Honda Fit CRV or a RAV4 | This car was the perfect compromise | My test drive proved this car to be much superior than those I had test driven | My only fear was that I would buy a mini van | I think this hip car needs its own category | Perhaps call it a giant hatch back | Either way I love it and it suits my needs | 
 "words": I drove this car for about a month | The mileage for the first trip was weird | On the 400 miles highway trip I got 37 mpg | This is far exceeded the manufacturer claim | On the last leg of the trip about 90 miles a got 22 mpg | This is really weird since it's all on highway with the same road and traffic condition | I cannot explain the wide discrepancy | The second trip on the same road the mileage was about 33 mpg | The interior material is a bit on the cheap side | The plastic scratches easily and the cloth material is not up to standard with Honda or Toyota | I got this for 17 | 2k I am not sure this is a good deal | 
 "words": After a lot of research and looking and driving everything | I stumbled upon a 2009 Mazda5 | Roomy fun to drive great mileage cool looking fantastic level of standard equipment seats 6 comfortably plus equipment | I couldn't find a single thing wrong with it everything was perfect the fit and finish paint assembly | The stereo is supurb the automatic rain sensing wipers are cool handling is great too |

 "words": My wife and I have a newborn | We needed a second car besides our Corolla and agreed that the main requirement of a new car was the fun factor | This car is a lot of fun from playing musical chairs between cargo people and space it's cool | The ride is pretty cool too | I agree with most that a few more horses under the hood would be nice but I'm OK because I like my gas mileage low | Handles well looks great | No one ever knows what a Mazda5 is when you tell them but once they see it and ride in it they become fans | We are young parents and knew this was a great car for our family but it's also a hit with friends parents night off | Who said you have to drive a Scion or Mini to be cool these days | 
 "words": Xenon headlights | Bluetooth | Auto rain sensing wipers | Heated seats | Room for 6 | Low 20's sticker | Is there a better vehicle on the market | We purchased our Mazda 5 last month and have not only loved the car but enjoyed tanks averaging above 30 mpg around town | Our growing family fits perfectly our four dogs love the folded down cargo area and we just came home from Vegas through snow with the vehicle handling perfectly | Notwithstanding some minor build quality issues is is the best new vehicle we have owned in the last five years and we have purchased 6 | I recommend this vehicle to anyone | Best of luck trying to find a better overall value |

 "words": Traded in my 2002 Dodge Durango for a Copper Red Mica GT | Loved the Durango but not the 13 MPG | Only 460 miles on Matt D Mazda and my expectations have been met | Third row is too tight for adults but fine for kids up to middle school | MPG running in low to mid 20s with mixed city and highway 22 and 24 | I have not had the opportunity for a long drive 300 miles but feel advertised 27 MPG for automatic is not only achievable but beatable | Vehicle feels quick | Some reviews critical of pick up but I find more than adequate | Excellent ride and comfortable | Perfect vehicle to run errands with the family |
