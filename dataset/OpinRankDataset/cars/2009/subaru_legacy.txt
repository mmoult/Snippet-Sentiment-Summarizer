REVIEWS
 "words": My wife and I love our Subaru Limited | We have had it for 3 months and no buyers remorse here | Handling no comparison with other models in its class | Steering and overall comfort is wonderful | Test drove Altima Accord and Sonata | Though the others each had their perks and overall better gas mileage the AWD and wonderful drive sold it for us | 3-4 MPG less was not an issue with so many other nice features | The vehicle turns on a dime and handles great in the rain | I can't wait to see how it handles under winter conditions | The HK sound system is great too but was not a reason to buy | The car sold itself for us | 
 "words": This vehicle handles like no other | This is the fourth new car I have owned and it handles far better than any new car I have ever driven | I traded in my clunker | 96 chevy tahoe with a 5 | 7 litre V8 so the 4 cylinder took a bit of getting used to but as I get accustomed to the power it is pretty snappy | Seats not too comfortable for long drives but it's very easy and very fun to drive | I took it up to the Colorado mountains twice and it climbs with ease and handles those curves above the speed limit without so much as a mild screech | This vehicle is phenomenal I love it I recommend it to everyone | The elderly may find it too low to the ground so it is with most cars | 
 "words": I've had my Legacy for 1 year now and just love it | It's fun to drive and gets excellent highway miles | My first not a mom car | but it's a really cool grandma car | Whenever I mentioned wanting to get a Subaru to anyone they always had good things to say about them whereas when I'd mention possibly getting a different car they always had a nice car but | answers | We have owned 2 previous used Subaru's in the past and have gotten almost 300000 miles on them | Expect to get many dependable years from my Legacy | 
 "words": I've had my Legacy for a few weeks now and have enjoyed driving it | It's not going to blow people away when the traffic lights change but it's pretty nimble and responsive | It's a fun car to drive | The stereo is nice | The handling is excellent | It's quiet inside the cabin with very little wind or road noise | Gas mileage has hovered between 24 and 26 mixed city highway driving and I got over 31 mpg on a trip up the interstate over Labor Day weekend | It's getting better gas mileage than I expected it would which is an added bonus | 
 "words": I bought this car back in May of this year because I was looking to trade in my 2006 Chevy Equinox which I hated so I saw an advertisement on tv for Subaru and decided to check it out | I never owned a Subaru before so this was a new experience for me once I got in it and test drove it there was no turning back | The car drives great handles great over all just a fun car | The HK audio system is incredible those are the types of audio systems they put in much more expensive vehicles such as BMW | The only thing I don't like about this car is that it seems to pull to the right and the dealership told me that awd vehicles tend to do that | Not sure if anyone else has experienced this | 
 "words": I just got my Legacy a month ago and I could not be happier | We broke it in on a 3000 mile trip to SC | It cruised through rain that had people pulling over because they could not see | We averaged 70 mph with the A C on and the mileage was 31 | Great safety with the 6 airbags and traction control | I have been told it had a 5 star rating | Great HK stereo very quick with the 5 speed | Steering is precise and the roadholding is fantastic | I had two Audis and I like this more | Plus if it did have a maintenance problem which I don't think it will it would be cheap to fix | A lot of car for 19K | 
 "words": We have had this 1st time Subaru for 1 year and find that it is not comfortable for us older citizens | The passenger seat is very low and cannot be raised | Passenger has a difficult time exiting car because the car is set low and the seat is low | Driver 5'11 175 is hard on the legs for the same reason | With seat lowered for driving comfort car it is difficult to enter and exit | MPG not up to rating for all in city driving | But once inside the car is very good driving and fun to drive | We will go back to a Camry even though the price on the Subaru is terrific | No service problems in the year | Be sure seats are comfortable and park at a curb on your test drive | 
 "words": I traded in a 2008 Toyota FJ Cruiser for this car and I have been pleasantly surprised | It gets WAY better mileage than the FJ which required premium gas | I took advantage of the smokin' 199 month lease that Subaru was offering but I had never had one before | Needless to say I was a little skeptical of just how good a Subie could possibly be and I NEVER thought I would purchase one | All I knew was that they were equipped with all wheel drive and there were many of them in Colorado | After my first test drive I was sold | This car is every bit as good and in most cases better than all the Toyota and Honda sedans I've owned | Better looks handling traction interior and comfort | 
 "words": My new Legacy 2 | 5i SE is our 6th Subaru and arguably the best | The car is the smoothest riding and shifting car I've ever owned | At the end of a long day there is nothing like my commute home in it 1 2 hour city and country driving to make me forget my day | Better still the fuel mileage is way better than I was expecting about 29 MPG mixed driving conditions | The seats are really comfortable and the stereo is pretty awesome too | Even though the interior is a little smaller than comparable models it fits around you giving you a nice blend of sport and luxury | Now I can't wait for wintertime driving and its AWD traction control | Our other Subaru is 14 years old and we still love it | 
 "words": I've had my 2009 Legacy 3 | 0R with nav for almost three months now and I absolutely love it | Its 3 | 0 V6 is incredibly smooth and quick the interior mine is black leather is gorgeous -it looks like a much more expensive car on the inside- and its exterior styling is unlike other cars | I love that you don't see many Legacys on the road | It makes them somewhat unique | The AWD 18 rims Bilstein shocks paddle shifters and SI Drive make it a performance sedan | Although it's a four-door it doesn't feel like one on the inside | It sits low and is narrow | It's the perfect size | I do wish the car had more technology features like an improved nav system proximity key HID headlights etc | 
 "words": My sixth Subaru 79 and 87 wagons 81 Brat 95 Legacy 03 Forester | Still have the Forester and Brat | Just picked up a 2009 Legacy 2 | 5i Limited-21800-and 2 | 9 financing | This is a good time to get the 09 models with the new 10's coming in | Initial impressions-firm but sporty ride seats are hard but I am coming from a very soft seat in a Ford Explorer drove smoothly on the 125 mile trip back from the dealer | Nice sound system from the Harmon Karden stereo | Very similar in size to my old 95 Legacy -on the smaller size of the competition but my 6-year old fits fine in the backseat in her booster seat | 22 | 6mpg on the drive home but that should improve with time | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Subaru 2 Legacys and one Outback | This is a company car that I drive daily and put over 40000 miles on per year | To say the least they have all been great cars | Zero problems with any of them | Between the 3 I've put over 200000 miles on these cars not too bad | The AWD works great in wet weather | This is a very safe very stable car | I wish the base engine had a little more spunk and wish the ipod input was on the dash instead of in the console | Other than that buy one change the oil every 7500 miles and drive drive drive | Oh and the gas mileage is great | I average 30 MPG on the interstate with the cruise set between 75-78 | 
 "words": OK so my clunker died and it was time for new wheels | I am a 35 year old man and a father | I wanted something fun sporty comfy and fun to drive | And I found it | I could not be happier with my Legacy 3 | 0R Limited | The car is a rocket smooth as silk on the road and is loaded with enough features to keep me busy for the next 6 months figuring them all out | Nav works well although sometimes takes an odd turn or two | The car is a beauty and accelerates better than any I have ever driven and I test drive frequently as I am a car lover | This is a driver's car in every way and Subaru deserves more street cred after making a machine like this one | I truly look forward to driving | 
 "words": I've owned my Subaru for 1 month and I'm loving it | It handles great and is just a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": Had this car 4 months now and love it | My wife and I used to alternate driving our cars around town but now I drive everywhere | The car is getting the rated mileage unlike the Nissan Versa I traded in | I get about 21 mpg in 90 city driving and about 27 on the hwy | You'll be hard pressed to find a family sedan with AWD a moon roof and this level of refinement for the price | 
 "words": We leased this car based on our positive experience with our 2008 Impreza Outback Sport | This 2009 Legacy Special Edition is an unbelievable value considering the TOP SAFETY ratings | This car has TOP IIHS safety ratings which is important to me for my college age daughter | THIS car handles and accelerates very well | It is EXTREMELY QUIET even at highway speeds | The four speed transmission is MORE than ADEQUATE regardless of what others have written | Highway gas mileage is above 30 mpg with City mileage ranging from 25-26 mpg | AWD SAFETY RELIABILITY see Consumer Reports Comfort and STYLE make this car a TRUE winner in my opinion | 
 "words": We bought this car after a whole year of online research and test drives | Completely satisfied after a month of ownership | We needed a safe car for our 5-year-old twins and the Legacy is definitely that | It's also a real pleasure to drive | The overall impression is that it's extremely solid but also very agile not an easy combination | Steering is just about perfect responsive and precise | The engine is smooth and has good torque | Visibility is great | Simple no hassle driving and parking | Interior design is very handsome and oozes quality | Not a large car but big enough for a family of 4 | Superior value for the money | I'll post again after driving in winter conditions | 
 "words": When I was forced to abandon ownership of my Jetta because no one in my town was talented enough to fix it I looked at the Subaru | I live in the mountains in NC and thought that AWD would be a good idea | I bought a 2009 Legacy 2 | 5 Special Edition issue | Although the pick up isn't quite like my Jetta everything else more than surpasses my expectations and desires | My favorite part is the stability in rain no ice yet but am waiting for winter the car handles hazardous road conditions like a magnet on steel | I was amazed | I also love the stereo system especially since I can plug in my iPod | Now I can listen to Stephanie Miller podcasts on my way to work | I love my Subaru | 
 "words": I would not recommend this car to anyone | The transmission shifts so roughly the entire car lurches but the dealership insists it is fine | The seats are extremely uncomfortable my back kills by the time I arrive at work | The interior looks worn after only having the car for a few weeks | I purchased this car because I wanted an AWD vehicle and the price seemed good but I regret every time I step foot in the car | 
 "words": I have driven this car for the last 2 months and I love it | I owned an infiniti J30 and a cruddy 2000 maxima | The legacy GT handles like it is on rails and its probably just as good as BMW for half the price | The design of the car is humble and the interior is comfortable I love the sound system and the way the seat feels | The navigation is not so high tech but it does work well | Bottom line this car is unique and is a awesome to drive for those who get it | You really need to drive one to understand | Infiniti Lexus and BMW woo you with unnecessary options | Subaru is like an underground entity which only those with the brains over brawn will understand | BUY ONE | 
 "words": The company I work for has a few Subarus before I worked there I would have never thought about owning one | Now I would not have it any other way | One of the office Subarus has over 220000 miles on it 99 ImprezaMT another has 130000 miles on it 05 ImprezaMTI've driven the 05 like I stole it too | We change the oil and rotate the tires | I chose the Legacy a little roomier than the Impreza | I also opted for the 5 speed MT less overall ownership cost and I control the MPG a little more than the AT not a computer | I don't understand the mileage rating from Subaru I read other posts and several people have pointed out that these cars can get 32-36 mpg on the hwy | I do too | 
 "words": I did a lot of research both online and in person before buying | Safety was a huge factor for me so the great safety ratings and crash test results were a large part my decision | I ended up getting a 2009 Legacy Limited sedan | It handles very well | The 2009 has stability control standard | Feels pretty sporty around the curves | The AWD helps | The base engine has more than enough power for my driving habits | If you need more get the turbo or 6 cylinder | The interior layout is great | very logical and oriented toward the driver | For a family car it's a fun car to drive | It's a little small compared to other midsized sedans but is comfortable for average sized adults | 
 "words": Just picked up my 2009 Legacy Limited | Impressed by just about every feature of this car | The only con that I may note would be that the vehicle has frame less windows | When you close the door you get your fingerprint smudges all over the window | Other than that it is an awesome vehicle | 
 "words": This car is fantastic | I have not had a new car since 1997 | I am cheap and the Legacy sold me at a very modest price | I have not looked back | This car is sleek handles beautifully in this Ohio snow season is comfortable quiet and has a great sound system | The peace of mind from the AWD traction control is well worth the loss in miles | Plus I don't drive all that much anyway to worry too much about 1 or 2 mpg | Hands down best car for the price | 
 "words": Looked at purchasing a new car for about a year | Looked at Saturn Aura Nissan Altima Honda Accord Coupe | The Saturn was very nice but the build quality was not that great I didn't know if the dealership would exist in the future | The Accord coupe rode very hard the seats were very hard the dashboard was too busy | Hadn't considered another Subaru have a 2005 Outback 2 | 5i until I determined I didn't like the Saturn or Honda | Drove the Forester great | then decided getting the Legacy was a no-brainer given the reliability of my Outback | I gave the Outback to my wife purchased the Legacy Limited | Now we both have no problems getting to our mountain top home in the winter | 
 "words": Purchased after several years of careful research | I have a 2006 Subaru Impreza | The two cars feel quite different in spite of only 200 lb more | The Impreza non-turbo feels very light and agile | The Legacy is much more solid and mature | After 20 years of driving a stick shift I cannot immediately adjust from one to another | The stick shift is the way to go and still one needs to work the gears a little more on the Legacy | Sound isolation is better | On a recent trip I got 35 mpg highway at 65 mph with a loaded car with 3 adults and luggage and 33 mpg measured at the pump at 75 mpg | City is 23 25 mpg | Outstanding for AWD and any midsize | Extremely stable in snowstorms | Very happy with it
 "words": Owned high performance Audis S6 S4 BMW M3 and even a Mercedes or two but love getting into and driving this car as much if not more | The car is tight quick and comfortable and looks very sporty with its 18 inch wheels | 
 "words": I just got my Legacy last week and its great | It handles extremely well in the snow and even did better then my Jeep Cherokee | The car is sleek classy and comfortable to drive | 
 "words": Spent around a year researching a new car | This was the perfect fit for what I wanted | It fits all of my practical needs but retains a lot of personality on the road | The AWD system is amazing | This car never loses its composure | The car drives through rain and snow without losing a beat | Then handling is also fantastic without beating the passengers senseless | Getting about 25 mpg on average w a majority of city driving | Inside the seats are firm and supportive but comfy | The Harmon Kardon speakers sound great | I have no regrets on my purchase | Compared to Nissan Altima Volvo S40 VW Passat and Saab 9-3 this blew them all away | I'll probably be buying Subarus for a long time to come | 
 "words": I purchased the car in the midst of a bad snowstorm and the road conditions were terrible | Every car on the road was slipping | my brand new Subaru was perfect there | It was so good on that icy and snowy road | I love this car | I love the style and all of the added features | It is so cool | I am so in love with the white pearl color too | so pretty | 
 "words": I love this car | I spent 5 years researching cars hobby | I poured over reviews here on the NHTSA complaints database and several other sites | The only serious complaint I read was about MPG | If you want MPG don't get an AWD car | I challenge you to find a true AWD car with better MPG than this car | The AWD system is amazing now that they have VDC on it | I test drove an Audi A3 and A4 a Lexus IS 250 AWD an Acura RL SH-AWD a Volvo S40 AWD and a Mercury Milan AWD | In winter driving all of them had trouble engaging AWD fast enough on a packed snow turn and all struggled in fresh wet snow | The Legacy and the new Impreza had no problem | Love this car | 
 "words": I have a little over 600 miles on this car and so far I am very impressed | For the money this car is a steal | This car is a great alternative to Honda Toyota Nissan Mazda because it is one of the safest cars on the road and because its AWD | For the money you're getting a great car that you don't see too much on the road | It has many great features that are not standard on many cars costing this price | When I hear the name Subaru mentioned I think of AWD safety reliability quality and performance | This is one of the nicest cars in this price range | 
 "words": It is amazing to me that people do not know about this car | Comfortable good looks great price | I got an incredible 2 year lease | Outstanding reliability with my previous subaru | Very smooth manual easy shifting | If you want the best performance from this engine get the manual | 
 "words": This Legacy 2 | 5i is my first Subaru not only by myself but my entire family too | We have traditionally been a Honda Toyota Mazda family | I have fallen in love with this car | I am excited to drive it every single time I open the door | It has very good handling love taking tight turns and has a great European BMW look | I am VERY happy with this car and I can't wait to drive it in the Michigan winters | I am extremely happy with my first Subaru | I would recommend anyone to buy lease one who is looking for the best bang for your buck | 
 "words": I picked up my Ruby Red SE on Labor day and got the same lease deal they were offering on the '08 | Drove many other cars and this was love at first drive | I am a very large person but the smallish size doesn't bother me | Everything seems to be cut to fit | Quality is top notch | I have been given compliments nearly every day | My kids think it's a sports car and all the neighbors are jealous | 
 "words": Great lease deal due to fantastic residual values | Features and equipment at a level far in excess of price point of 23K | Interior quality at least comparable to cars 10K more expensive | Handling ride and comfort above average | Quietness is ok but nothing special | Overall I'm extremely happy with the car | 
 "words": As enthusiastic as I was about getting a new Legacy my expectations were exceeded | Interior quality and styling is far superior to anything in its class and many in a higher class | Though the cockpit is a bit narrower than most I'm still very comfortable despite my overly padded body I'm working on getting the weight off | Mileage in the mid 20s 50-50 city highway but with just a few hundred miles on it I expect the numbers will rise | Handling and ride are great and then there's the amazing level of equipment for the price | Where on earth can you get a great handling awd mid size with leather moonroof XM HK stereo vdc and the usual power accessories for just 23K | 
 "words": I just bought a 2009 legacy 2 | 5i special edition | I love the car a lot | It's a lot of fun to drive | The best feature on the car is the AWD | In poor weather you feel safe and steady on the road | I love the feel of the interior space | The car comes with a lot of features stock that other companies would charge extra for | 
 "words": This car suit my needs well | 4DR sedan with AWD enough power comfortable ride | It has all the features that I need plus a moon roof that I did not really need standard on 3 | 0R | All that for around 25k price tag was acceptable | I don't make much use of SI drive | I leave it on Sport mode and take it easy on the throttle instead of making the computer do it for me | That way I get fuel economy and throttle response also when needed | The MPG gauge does not show much of a difference unless I use low gear acceleration with Sport mode | Score of 6 for fuel economy is fair | Any worse then 17 city and 24 highway then I would not have considered this car and the estimate seems accurate | 
 "words": This is my third legacy and first on in 8 years | Coming from an 06 Acura TL I thought the handling would not be up to par but it is a significant upgrade with better control at higher speeds | The ride is firm but not bouncy | Obviously the four cylinder could use more power or even better another gear or two in the automatic | Fuel economy is about 25mpg with about 30 city driving | The Harmon Kardon sound system blows away the premium system in the Acura | Perfectly clear at all volume levels all the way to the max | Subaru was the only answer since we only purchase Subaru Honda and Toyota products and we wanted an AWD car | 
 "words": I have not yet recorded 900 miles on my '09 Legacy 2 | 5i Limited and I am very happy with my decision | It handles better than any car I've owned looks better and is more refined interior for less money than any of the other sedans I tested | Subaru has a reputation for being an incredibly safe vehicle and that meant a lot to me | This is my first Subaru but I hope not my last | 
 "words": Traded in my '05 mdx for the Subaru | I must say its fantastic | What a car | Performance is outstanding | The ride is super smooth and the handling is fantastic | I really can't say anything bad about Subaru | This is the best sedan by far I have ever owned | 
 "words": This is my 4th Legacy and by far the best one yet | The new Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade rocks and the car is so much value for the money | It feels solid and tight in any conditions handles amazingly the test drive will make you buy this car | and when you look at the sticker price compared to similar European makes costing much more it makes you feel smart and lucky | Wish it had Bluetooth love the new music and cruise control buttons on the wheel would like more ambient lighting inside which the Germans do to great effect | Elegant but not fussy this car is comfortable fun sporty and luxurious all at the same time | Simplicity of design still works and defines a nice car | 
 "words": An excellent smooth ride | Stable very little body roll even when accelerating into turns | Instrument panel and console layout well done | Smooth acceleration smooth stops | Originally considered SE but the Limited boasts a lot of features that more than justify the increase in cost though both trims drive exactly the same | Seats are comfortable power seats telescoping tilt wheel easy to find your sweet spot in the driver's seat | The 2 | 5 4-cylinder is more than enough power | If you are considering a mid-size sedan the safety features of this Subaru more than make up for the sacrifice of a few MPG with a FWD RWD car |
