REVIEWS
 "words": Good Hybrid alternative to Toyota and Honda | Good rebates from Nissan and also could deduct the CT sales tax | overall good car
 "words": Bought this car after looking at the 09 Accord EX-L | The Altima is more sporty quiet and more fun to drive | Not to mention the excellent gas mileage | With the current Nissan rebate of 3250 and tax incentive the price is hard to beat | You will not be disappointed in this car | 
 "words": The Altima Hybrid is a true Jekyll Hyde | It saves me gas and its sporty and fun to drive | It has enough room for my family I can stretch out in it and it looks great | When the spirit moves me and I just have to get away fast I hit the pedal to the metal and the electric motor feels like a supercharger as it pushes the 2 | 5 over 100mph | 
 "words": Very good driving experience so far | 1800 miles with one 600 mile road trip | Car has convenience package with electric driver seat cloth interior preferred over leather | Smooth quiet ride with easy and responsive handling | Size of car is comfortable for family of four on a short to medium trip so far | MPG so far | low 29 high 34 mpg | 
 "words": Extremely disappointed first and last Nissan | Vehicle initially worked fine for first month than began to shake violently when going into EV mode | Dealer fixed it but now it will not drive in EV Mode | Been back to two separate dealers both of which say its normal | First said it has learned my driving habits so it won't drive in EV the second claims EV does not work when the air conditioning is on doesn't seem to work with it off 6000 miles on it and am ready to unload it | 
 "words": I thought I was going to buy a 2010 Prius | I was just waiting for the right one to become available when I happened upon the Altima Hybrid | What a stroke of luck | It is so much more car for less money as it turned out | The Altima I got is fully loaded and is a GREAT car | It drives beautifully with power when you need it and little road noise lots of comfort and great handling | I marvel at the technology that has gone into this car | Truly remarkable | I highly recommend this car to anyone considering a hybrid | At least give it a test drive | The mileage is pretty good 35 mpg so far and the tax incentives are great 2350 federal and 1500 state OR | Nissan is making great deals now | 
 "words": Honestly one of the best eco cars we looked at | After considering a Prius and a Jetta TDI we went with the Altima and could not be happier | Although the fuel economy of the prius would have been better it doesn't have the comfort or size that the Altima has | BOSE audio sounds great and is the best audio system of all the others we looked at | Altima also handles and drives better overall than any other hybrid we looked at | Overall we could not be happier with the Altima because of its great performance and how fun it is to drive | 
 "words": I am a new owner and very pleased with first month of driving | I am 6'5 an 275 too big for most cars and so have been driving vans pickups but I tried an Altima at an autoshow and found I fit great in this car | I have only owned for a short time but so far the Altima Hybrid performs well has a quiet comfortable ride gets good mileage now averaging 31mpg driving aggressive it seems to have good build quality materials I got convenience package only | I also think it is remarkably fun to drive far more sporty and quick than my wife's non-hybrid 4-cyl Accord | Also runs in whisper quiet EV mode up to around 25-30mph which is lots of fun on twisty rural backroads | 
 "words": I just bought the car less than a week ago | I was too stupid didn't realize the problem when I was test driving it | Whenever you try to slow down or hit the brake it actually sounded like an ambulance or police car siren 800 feet away from you | The dealership was in a quite busy neighborhood so I really thought there were police cars or ambulance around or down that street not until I bought the car and drove home and drove in my nice neighbor realizing that sound is from stepping on the brake | I brought it back to the dealer they can't do anything about it and I am stuck with this brand new car with horrible sound | Don't ever buy a Nissan car | 
 "words": Just bought it | It is powerful very quiet and fun to drive | Save a lot of gas and got the average 42mpg | 
 "words": Had the hybrid for 1700 miles | It has greatly exceeded my expectations | I am getting 38 | 3 mpg and as the engine breaks in I expect it to go higher | The list price of 29k was a little steep but with 3250 cash back by Nissan and a 2350 tax credit I was able to get this vehicle with the Convenience package for under 21k | 
 "words": Just bought this car | The buying experience was very good | Love driving this car and getting great gas mileage is even better | Bose sound system is great | Bluetooth phone feature works fine | 
 "words": Bought new 09 NAH | Plan is to keep the car for roughly 8 years so chose the best value considering cost over that time frame gas maintenance tax credit rebates incentives invoice | Toyota Camry-H TCH and NAH were top contenders | 2350 tax credit pushed NAH ahead and Nissan was aggressive in rebates chose NAH fully loaded | Engine shifts to gas very quickly during acceleration | The car doesn't go to hybrid mode quickly when the engine is cold even on a hot sunny day after work | Adjusting my driving longer brakes slow acceleration maintain cruising longer I get about 33-38mpg | aggressive driving 24-28 normal driving 28-30mpg in city 25mph-55mph roads freeway about 35mpg
 "words": I am 6'5 and it was very hard to find a non-SUV hybrid that fits me | This one did | In fact this is the only one that did | The result is that I needed to drive 120 miles to NJ to get one since they are not available in my home state of Maryland | 
 "words": We chose the Altima after looking at both the Prius and Camry hybrids | Glad we made the choice | Car rides smoothly and is quiet | Mileage is great for a car of this size if you're easy on the pedal | Consistently get 33 36 mpg all around | Extremely disappointed with the Technology Package | Definitely not worth it | The Nav system often suggests longer and less direct routes | Our little 150 Garmin does a much better job | The built-in Blue Tooth is virtually useless for dialing out calls | My little 30 ear piece does a better job | Sound system is great | The fiber-glass bumpers are cheaply made and easily damaged | I backed into a curb at less than 3 mph and cracked the rear bumper | 
 "words": I only visit the gas station once every two weeks now which is half as often as I did with my 2004 Acura TSX | I opted for the fully loaded tech package so I have all the goodies | navigation Bose rear back- up camera etc | I think I enjoy the performance well enough for a hybrid | 
 "words": I carefully considered the Honda and Toyota Hybrids | Personally the style of the available brands next to the Altima was no comparison with the Altime clearly the winner in style speed great gas mileage price space and features | Altima appearance to me is far superior inside and out | I moved from a Camry due to a total loss accident to the Altima Hybrid for all of the reasons I just mentioned and the superior crash ratings the Altima has | Drive everything else first then get into an Altima | If you like features speed a comparable price and style that turns heads everywhere you go the Altima Hybrid is the clear winner | The tax credit and being green is a winner in any city | 
 "words": The main selling point for me was the fuel economy and emissions | The NAH is rated one of the five top-rated cars for fuel efficiency and emissions at the EPA web site | After driving the car for a month I believe I made the right decision | It doesn't feel as floaty as some of the more luxury cars that I test drove but has much more power and better handling than the other hybrids I drove | While it doesn't get as good mileage as the Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid it's much more enjoyable and comfortable to drive | 
 "words": Got base model for 21995 after rebate incl destination fee | If the price hadn't been so low the fuel benefit wouldn't have outweighed the added cost | LOVE it | The accel | is as good as my old accord better than my wife's civic | Poor Braking distance is non- issue | it feels like it can stop on a dime even at 3500 lbs | The eCVT is ideal | I have never driven a continuous transmission | Has abundant safety features for my family and I was even surprised that alloy wheels are standard although I don't know the added benefit of alloys just that they cost more | A small thing I love is the key | Just have it in your pocket you can open the trunk unlock doors start the car | 
 "words": This car is a blast to drive | The MPG on the first tank was 36 | 5 for over 300 miles both city and highway driving Nissan promised 34 mpg combined | The design of the inside and outside of the car is wonderful | My only complaint is that we did not buy this car earlier | We purchased this car with every toy possible |
