REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased my 2009 Maverick Silver G8 GT in lieu of a BMW 550 | Not only was the G8 almost 50000 less than the BMW it actually performed better | I am 6'4 and weigh 330lbs | I fit perfectly in the car | On the road I average 28mpg and about 15mpg around town | The car is very quick and handles well | It has been trouble free up to this point and believe it or not the car is quite exclusive | I can go a month without ever seeing one on the road and I live in N | Dallas | Sadly the G8 is no more but the legend will live on | I am very happy with my purchase | 
 "words": Best vehicle owned to date | Well beyond expectations | Bad idea for GM not to continue to offer this in the US | Want one bad enough | go to Australia | M5 killer for half the price | Also have a 2009 Vette with same engine | G8 can almost keep up | Only regret no offer of an in-dash nav | This is one of the top 5 sport sedans in the world | bar none | regardless of price | At 415 hp it's only 100 per pony | Glad to have one of the very few GXP's sold | hopefully a collector for the future | 
 "words": Thi is one of the finest cars that I've ever owned It is fast well styled handles well and is quite comfortable | It is a shame that it wil soon no longer be available since it is one of the very best four-door sedans ever offered by GM | I also owned a 2004 Pontiac GTO and the G8 is superior to it in every way faster roomier and better looking | The rear seating area is especially well done with comfortable seats and plenty of head and legroom | GM should not let this car get away | If you are considering the purchase of a high-performance GT get one of these while you still can | 
 "words": test drove G8 and test drove 2010 Camero enjoyed G8 more | great handlingvery roomy plenty of power for v6 got premium package cant ask nothing more out of this car | 
 "words": I love this car | I read all the great reviews on this web site before buying Sport Red Metallic GT V8 and the car has more than lived up to the rave reviews | The power is fantastic | Gas mileage is very good for a car with this power averaging 19 to 20 mpg mixed highway city | Over 25 mpg on highway when I can control my right foot | Acceleration off the line is amazing | I test drove the V6 and V8 | Get the V8 | It does not cost that much more and the gas mileage is almost the same | The extra power makes it that much more fun | 
 "words": The GT performance package provides the best of both worlds I was looking for | a quiet and refined 26mpg freeway ride to work and 0-60 in 5 | 3s performance car with exceptional handling on the 19 wheel package | Corners at 30-40 are a blast not to mention highway ramps | I love how the vehicle's manual mode really lets the car perform | Its balancing is exceptional | It's ashame GM didn't come out earlier with this vehicle and even more so that it will not be rebadged over to Chevy | Having driven BMW 5 series I'll take this car straight up | At 25K less its not even close | 
 "words": Have had this car for 6 months and about 7000 miles | It is an incredible value and I have no regrets on the purchase | The car is refined yet powerful in a way that no other sedan in the 20's real world price can touch | The torque is always available and free flowing and lets the car cruise at highway speeds effortlessly | Mileage is acceptable on the freeway quite bad 10 or so mpg in stop and go | The interior doesn't match the exterior style-wise and there are a few cheap plastic bits but I can live with it and the styling is nowhere near as tacky as some past Pontiacs | Big flaw is passenger seat does not go back far enough for taller people | Car was delivered with warped rotors | 
 "words": I have almost a year of experience with my 09 G8 GT | I am 63 years old and have owned many vehicles | My G8 GT has more bang for the buck than any of them | I get many positive comments on this vehicle for its looks and the way it goes down the road | Many of these comments are from people including women who have very little interest in cars | People ask me all the time what is it | I have had NO problems with this vehicle | This car is quiet and smooth as a big Cadillac under normal acceleration | Get on theLoud Pedal and it will definitely put a smile on your face | The head and leg room front and back seats is very good and the seats are very comfy | 
 "words": Exactly what I expected it to be after reading the literature and tons of reviews | It is a great ride and very willing to perform | A few minor oddities like the cup holder placement and lack of courtesy lights for rear passengers but nothing that affects the overall drive-ability | It is a shame it was cut | It was destined to be a top performer in the GM line | 
 "words": Purchased 3 weeks ago and spent last week in the shop | Initially told the fuel pump was bad | Dealer ordered fuel pump | Now we find out there are 2 fuel pumps and another is on order | Looks like I will have spent 1 2 of my ownership in the shop | The car isn't even tagged yet | Hope I don't have a lemon | 
 "words": Very nice interior and exterior styling with good fit and finish inside and out | Powerful engine with great V8 sound track and smooth power delivery | Wonderful driving dynamics | Very comfortable heated seats nice interior materials great sound system | Averaging 19 MPG in cold snowy conditions with snow tires | 
 "words": I have had the car 1 week and LOVE IT | This is the first American car I have owned in over 20 years and so far its a keeper | I did not realize how much I missed a V8 | except for the gas mileage | 
 "words": I bought a 2009 Pontiac G8 GT in White Hot on the 30th of December 2008 | So far I have about 800 miles on the OD and the car keeps getting better | Here in the Burgh the winter is sometimes a hindrance and yet I have had no problems with the rear wheel drive | One just needs to learn the right amount of pressure on the gas pedal and drive safe | I'm still breaking her in and will write more come summer once she's got a few thousand miles | 
 "words": Pontiac G-8 GT is my 3rd Ponitac and by far the best | I had a 96 Grand Prix GT 2-door for 10 years traded for a 06 Pontiac Solstice and traded for the 09 Pontiac G8 | It is the best car I've ever had has everything you can possibly think of design and interior is awsome at night | The best part is the performance all I can say is wow | 
 "words": I love my G8 GT for a lot of reasons | All have been stated many times over in other reviews | However I have a special reason to like this car | In past years when my wife and I loaded up previously owned cars with maybe 500 lbs of tools and luggage for a few months at our vacation house I had to shim the rear springs to help keep similar and safe driving dynamics | In my G8 GT this past fall the heavy load had little or no impact on my mormal driving experience | I credit this to the great suspension of this car | 
 "words": I have had this car for a week now love it | This is my first American made car | Very fun and quick car | What attracted me to this car was it put you in the mind of a BMW and not only that its a pretty red car but the fact is it was not many on the road which could be a bad or good thing but my thought was it would a good thing because it stands out from all the other cars and it does just that | People are always take a second look and comment on how beautiful my G8 GT is | 
 "words": I had been waiting for this to happen for some time | And it was worth it | I looked long and hard at the competition Malibu Accord Altima Camry Sonata Lucerne etc | but this was the winner | I didn't buy it for the rear wheel drive but for the size and style | It is very sporty looking agressive even | The interior is clean uncluttered and straightforward | The switch gear location designed to make the switch from right hand drive in Australia to left hand drive in the US takes some getting used to but it isn't too big a deal | I am extremely happy so far and so glad to be ride of my 2002 Camry | This is a much more exciting car | 
 "words": We really thought that we had found our dream car even though we traded in a 2006 330I BMW | We loved the whole look and feel until we drove our new vehicle home for the first time | Mind you this vehicle was on the showroom floor the odometer read 11 miles | While driving our new vehicle we first noticed that it did not idle properly and at various speeds between 30-45mph and 50-65mph there is a harmonic vibration | We have spoken with the auto specialist thinking that they would know what was happening since they are familiar with the vehicles they sell | We were told that this is normal for the 6 | 0L | We do not believe this is normal and we are still currently having these issues today | 
 "words": Update from 9-28 purchased oem19in rim tire fits perfectly into the spare tire well | R R air pressure sensor failed quickly replaced by Pontiac | Mixed very easy driving yielding about 21 22 | We don't drive very much these days so gas mileage not a problem | Fretted about buying an 8 cyl did not need nor want the extra horses it just drove better than the 6 cyl | Quieter many options were standard | Apparently no insurance penalty for the 8 cyl | Love the overall quietness comfort of this car | Rumor has it GM is ready to do away with Pontiac | Would not have purchased it had I known | If this happens I guess the 5 year 100k warranty will be worthless | Too bad love the car | 
 "words": The G8 GT's performance is amazingly close to my Audi RS 6 450 hp which cost 85K in 2003 | With a tune I suspect the Audi's only remaining performance advantage would be traction thanks to AWD | If GM had been turning out products like the G8 GT all along they wouldn't be begging before Congress | 
 "words": Unbelevably awesome | The fit and finish of this car is so solid you would think it was built in Germany | The motor pulls very hard on demand | Yet can be mild bopping around town | The engine management system is seamless | A driver's car | 
 "words": Great exterior styling nice cool interior except for the center battery and oil display ugh | Also someone forgot to install the trunk sound dampening material lining | the dealer put in 09 sound material | Our 1996 Bonneville SSEi has a heads- up display and I wonder why Pontiac never pushed this and or continued this cool feature in other models | Anyway we like our White Hot G8 a lot | and there aren't that many G8's on the road it seems and that's cool | It drives well is tight on curves and moves out when you want to | It feels sturdy and solid-well put together | 
 "words": This car is simply an amazing value | It is extremely powerful roomy suave and tons of fun to drive | It's family friendly too | Go buy one what are you waiting for | 
 "words": Initial review 9-08 since then I purchased a G8 19in rim tire fits perfectly in the spare well | Love the seats seatbelts very comfortable | Still averageing about 20mpg in mixed very easy driving | One tire air pressure sensor failed quickly replaced by dealer | Only have 1k so far
 "words": I have the V6 it is extremely noisy low gas mileage especially in town | I get maybe 24 on the open highway | They replaced the tires twice at the dealer and it still shakes at 65 70 MPH | The worst feature is the front passenger seat does not go back as far as the driver side | It is 5 inches shorter and anyone over 5 foot 10 inches is very uncomfortable | Pontiac attitude is poor regarding this
 "words": As I said in my title fantastic value for the dollar | Feels very much like my friend's 2008 BMW 550 for less than half the money and is actually a little faster | Great road car with great seats | The back seat is probably more comfortable than the front and it has 7 series room back there | Gas mileage isn't so fantastic but it deteriorates little with speed and it is more economical around town than my V6 Saturn Aura | I bought the car in Ohio and made a major road trip bringing it back out to Cali for the winter | I couldn't ask for a better vacation car | A mid 13 second 170 mph 22 mpg large four door sports sedan for 31k | I can't complain much about that | 
 "words": My parents got this car for me as a graduation present and I'm loving it | I went to the dealership to test drive the G6 when the G8 caught my eye | I walked right passed the G6 and asked for the keys to the G8 | By the look of the car I knew I wanted it | My parents were sold on the fact that it had Onstar | Great car for anyone who likes to go fast | Before I never liked to drive places now I volunteer to go anywhere | Great kick and speed for a 6cyl | 
 "words": Considered the G8 among others including MB C350 BMW 550i | MB too small 550i too pricey and rode way too rough | The G8 is my 'Goldilocks' car just right and 1 2 the price of the Beemer | Can't get over the value for the dollar | Have owned MB BMW Lexus before every time I mash the go pedal the status issue disappears | Mileage on the road was actually 24 | 5 in town about 16-17 mixed driving | Can't tell when cylinder deactivation happens but big v8 vibrates at idle like my old Camaro shouldn't happen today | Lots of room in back for 6 footers huge trunk a great 'family car' that will still open your sinuses from adrenaline when pushed | compliant but firm ride | Buy 1 You won't be sorry | 
 "words": Have had the G8 for over 2 months and have about 4000 miles on it | The power is awesome and was great driving in the mountains of Georgia | It is a fantastic car for the cost | I would tell anyone to test drive it and I know they will love it | 
 "words": I recently purchased the G8 and so far have nothing but praise | The car is as smooth as silk but when prompted takes of like a cannon I have owned five mustang GT's including a Cobra and this car would smoke them all | I had my eye on this car when it first came out and do not regret buying it at all | If you're looking for a smooth ride with plenty of power I would suggest you buy this car | You cannot beat the price for what you get | 
 "words": I had a Monte Carlo SS which was a great car but I really wanted a V8 sport sedan with rear wheel drive 4 doors and a generous trunk | When the G8- GT came out I waited until the 2009 model and purchased a GT with the sport package and the premium package | This car is everything that I wanted | Great looks | outstanding power superb handling exceptional braking comfortable interior with plenty of room for everybody | I have the color Pacific Slate which brings many compliments | This car is the best bang for the buck when you compare apples to apples | I am a strong supporter of GM and their products | My wife loves the on star system and the xm radio | 
 "words": It's been a long time since I've owned a car that came close to this G8 | Unbelievable value and price | The driving experience is outstanding don't miss the opportunity to test drive this car you'll love it | 
 "words": This is a phenomenal vehicle for the money and overall I am very pleased with it | My only complaint is the fact that the vehicle left the factory with a defect hole in the gas tank | It was discovered after a 1600 mile trip to Las Vegas | After repair I contacted Pontiac's customer service division about the problem from the safety standpoint and they really didn't seem to care | I love the car I do not care much for Pontiac Motor Division's so called customer service | I will probably not purchase another Pontiac product due to this but the car is a lot of fun | 
 "words": Only two weeks old first tank of mixed town country was 22 mpg | nice firm ride great handling quiet comfortable rideexcellent brakes | Seems to be a good value for the price but I will wait a few years to make that call | Cannot read the DIC | without reading glasses which I don't drive with | Still trying to get a 19 rim for the spare none apparently available yet |

 "words": I thought my next new vehicle would be a compact electric or diesel SUV until an unplanned test drive of the '09 Pontiac G8 GT placed it in my driveway | It is more than the silky power that keeps a smile on my face and makes me find more excuses to drive more often | Over 3600 of the 6000 km in the first month of ownership was on a single round trip over mountain highways | Fully loaded with family treasures we averaged 9 | 1 L 100 km | Great seat design and driving position allowed two daily legs of 1100 km with complete comfort | The handling inspires confidence and low stress on the twisties and road irregularities | All features demonstrate thoughtful quality design and manufacturing care | 
 "words": This car is the perfect replacement for people like me who are tired of the ever increasing price of Audis BMWs Volvos etc | No price gouging on the options packages either | There are only three options and they are all very reasonably priced | Just try to get a Sports Package on a European car for under 600 | The car is an incredible value | Fast great handling great build quality great looking | Also very quiet and comfortable | I've had M3s 3 Series 5 Series SAABs and my last car was a Volvo S60R | This car shames them all and at this price it's a knock out in the first round |

 "words": I am now into my second week owning this car and wow | You can't imagine how many heads this car turns | Obviously the HP is great out of the hole but you really notice it on the highway with its passing power | The styling and handling is equal or better than anything I test drove before buying CTS A4 BMW 3 | I can't believe their isn't more of these on the road already it really is a big step up for Pontiac and GM | The one thing you really need to know is if you don't want to buy this car DO NOT TEST DRIVE IT | Once you take it for a spin you will not want to let go | 
 "words": I bought a Black 09' Pontiac G8 GT and could not be happier | I have been to the gas station a couple times and people come right up to me asking me all about the car | I too love when stopping at red lights and having the car rattle slightly from the V8 anxiously waiting to go | I smile every time I go on a drive and glad this was the first new car I have purchased |

 "words": This car is ridiculous | Everywhere I go it turns heads | Pontiac listened to all the customer suggestions on the 2008 and on the 20009 got rid of the oil temperature gauges in the center console added XM Radio standard and no noises other than the awesome purr of the engine as I upshift past overpriced German imports | The V8 blows doors on everything else in its class while getting surprisingly good gas mileage | If you want to enjoy driving again go get yourself a 2009 G8 GT |
