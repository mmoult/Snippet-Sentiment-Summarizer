REVIEWS
 "words": I got this car after owning many minivans | Most of the time I don | t have my family onboard so it is a waste of and fuel to drive around a bigger size vehicle | First time for me to own a foreign vehicle | Overall I am impressed with the quality of everything everything works nicely together | I love the small sport-sized steering wheel good handling some body lean though no squeaks rattles | overly well built | Fuel economy so far is not that great about 23mpg average but having just 1700 miles I hope it will improve with time | I miss the illuminated power window switches mirror switches which I use once in a lifetime is lighted but window switches are not except driver's | 
 "words": Very nice car very reliable I don't even think will I make it anywhere | Great gas mileage | Assembled in East Liberty Ohio with 60 US part contents | check out some Pontiacs G3- G4s etc | Some 100 Japan | The only bad thing I have to say about the Civic | that it wouldn't hurt to get some snow tires for snow my escort handled better in the snow | Other then that I always get people looking at my car very nice looking car and great style | 
 "words": I have 9000 miles on my Honda Civic | This is the 5th Honda I've owned and one of the best | I average 44 MPG after 9000 miles and yes I keep track after each fill-up | It's fun to drive and I really enjoy the split dash design | It has adequate low end pickup but highway passing won't set you back in the seat | The car excels in its mission of mixed highway and town driving | The ride is sport-like but some may call it harsh | It has a tight firm ride which I enjoy | The fit and finish of the interior is excellent | I would recommend more outlets in the front interior area but this is a rather picky criticism | 
 "words": This is my third Civic and I absolutely love it | Hondas are simply reliable and low maintenance | Everyone comments on both the exterior and interior | I find it to drive very smoothly and haven't found it to be loud | I've been in my friend's Cobalt talk about loud and obnoxious | I have had the car for a little over six months now and I've had no problems | I commute a pretty far distance and have also taken a long road trip | The gas mileage is great as well | I do mostly highway driving and average about 35 mpg | It's so fun to drive | 
 "words": Not sure if the city mileage rating is for less densely packed urban areas but I drive around Chicago all day and get about 18 mpg in the city | I haven't done much highway driving yet but those times where I have I'm pretty sure I'm getting over 30 mpg | My Civic only has about 700 miles on it it's hard to rack up miles in the city so I'm hoping once it's fully broken in the mpg will get a little better | It's still a lot better than my old '95 Explorer which got about 8 mpg in downtown Chicago | 
 "words": I've had no problems with the engine but everything inside this car rattles | the dash the door panel | and it drives you insane | Poor poor fit and finish | Sounds like loose change is inside the door | Took to dealer and of course they drove it on a smooth road and couldn't reproduce | Also when steering wheel is in upper position can't see the odometer | Automatic locking everything also drives you insane when getting groceries etc | out of the trunk and back seat | the doors keep locking found a way to disable the rear door auto-lock but the trunk eludes me | When you close trunk doors automatically lock | then you have to unlock them again | 
 "words": I went to the dealership to talk them out of their last S2000 however they were still very proud of it although it was a brand new 2008 model and I was trying to purchase it in June 2009 | I test drove many vehicles | I had previously owned an RX8 and had already wanted a NA high rev | engine | After I test drove the SI I was sold | Fun to drive affordable cheap insurance great build quality | The car has a great platform to add aftermarket parts at a reasonable price | Maintenance is so much more reasonable than the RX8 | Granted the RX8 is unique and handles like a dream | The Honda is just a great value for the price | 
 "words": I've had my 2009 EX for 3 months now and love it | Much more comfortable than the Corolla that I used to have | No complaints from me | There are times when I start it up it takes a couple of extra seconds to get the engine running | I've discovered if I park on the smallest hill sometimes there's a 'clunking' noise as I shift from P to R also there are times when I shift from R to D I've noticed the engine accelerates a little as the tachometer indicates but other than those minor things the '09 Civic is definitely an awesome car to own | 
 "words": The car is pretty everything everyone says it is | It is my 5th Civic and so far the best of them all | One thing I can attest to is the ride quality if your lower the air pressure by two pounds | It calls for 32psi but at that level the ride is rather stiff | If you lower the air pressure down to 30psi you will find the ride quality greatly improved without a loss in fuel economy | Since these tires do not last for much more than 30K you will not lose any wear in dropping the pressure by 2 pounds | It will make a huge difference in the ride quality | Try it and you will see for yourself | 
 "words": I really like the dashboard layout | Having the digital speedometer on the second tier I would actually consider a safety feature | It allows me to keep my eyes more on the road by not having to look down as far to see my speed | I love the black seating in the LX-S but as others have stated it does attract the lint | Really love the gas mileage and the handling | It has the typical Honda suspension that you feel the road bumps and hear the road noise | It is fun to drive | Great visibility all around | 
 "words": I bought the Civic GX because I love the idea of using natural gas instead of petroleum | The engine is smooth although somewhat underpowered | The car handles surprisingly well despite having a big and obviously heavy tank behind the back seat | I average around 37 mpg in mostly freeway driving | Mileage drops considerably on short city trips | Dashboard layout and visibility are excellent | The driver's seat unfortunately is undersized poorly designed and uncomfortable the seat in the Corolla is substantially better | E-brake in the knee underscores that the Civic is designed for small drivers | 
 "words": Having been a GM fan for years I see what I have been missing | I am impressed with this vehicle I have had it for a week now and I can't stop driving it | It makes me want to drive is fun to drive gas is great | You can't go wrong with this choice in my opinion | At least test drive one and you'll see what I mean | Good resale value as well | Lease rates are amazingly low compared to other Japanese automakers | 
 "words": I've had my Civic for about 2 months now and I really enjoy it | I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this vehicle and it has lived up to almost everything I heard read | I love both the interior and exterior styling the two tier dash is my favorite | The quality of the interior materials is far beyond that of some of its competitors namely the Toyota Corolla | I read some other reviews that complained about the lack of a remote trunk release 60 40 rear split seats and outside temperature gauge All of these features are available on the EX trim | My only complaint is the gas mileage | I average about 27 mpg | Based on my research I was expecting better fuel economy | 
 "words": Couldn't spring for the Insight because I got a great deal 21995 for this beauty | Just took a 500 mile trip down I95 and back to Northern Va and averaged 51 | 1 MPG with my wife and some luggage | No hypermiling used except I got in the rt lane behind a slow driver on the Interstate and I tried to coast in neutral down hills and build momentum for the next hill | In the 163 mile stretch from Fredricksburg Va to Chesapeake I averaged 54 | 2 MPG | The overall 51 | 2 included about 35 miles of city driving in Norfolk | The car is solid and drives smoothly and handles better than the 09 Prius | I think Honda does a great job with their cars | The 09 HCH is a stealth gem waiting to be discovered | 
 "words": Bought this car a few months ago and love it | Sportylooks good comfortablesolidand performs well for this class | Not the fastest per se but balanced in all areas | Opted out of the summer tires because of snow and it still handles great | Have owned Hondas for 21 years now and I don't regret this purchase at all | 2 tier dash works really wellstereo is decent and USB system rocks | Combination of size handling efficiency | The ride is firm but not harsh I don't understand all of the complaints about road noise | It is competitive with others in the class | I still love the high revving nature of Hondasover brute power | 
 "words": I'm a long time manual transmission driver and after an extensive search thought I'd found the perfect car | This car had the style and comfort unmatched in it's price and class | However after two weeks of driving this vehicle the transmission started to get very notchy in second gear especially when cold | Once winter hit the problem became noticeably worse to the point that it actually jumped out of second gear on several occasions | By mid-winter I didn't want to drive this car anymore | I took it to the dealer but they could not duplicate the issue when the engine trans was warm and they checked and flushed the trans fluid | I traded this car after 4 months and couldn't be happier | 
 "words": Commuting 65 miles day means gas mileage is paramount | and this car averages 38 MPG | The engine is quiet yet responsive | The seats are comfortable and supportive | The car handles well in traffic | 
 "words": Great Car I am very impressed with the fit and finish | Car handles well on both fwy and city streets | I've always bought Detroit iron but this car puts them all to shame | I just love the 43 | 5 average MPG | Cannot say enough good things about this car | 
 "words": 7 months ago I bought a 2009 Honda fit with 5 speed manual I decided to sell it and get a faster Honda civic coupe dx | I cant believe how much faster the civic coupe is with manual transmission than the fit and it handles so much better and looks better | I will never ever buy any other car than a Honda civic coupe | It feels like you are driving the fastest car on the road all while using no gas | Honda makes best cars in the world PERIOD | 
 "words": I have owned this vehicle for almost two months now and this is the first car I have never had to take back shortly after purchasing to have squeaks fixed or rattles fixed or adjustments made | Honda really has really got their act together | The first month or so the ride was a bit choppy but on the second month the suspension seems to have loosened up a bit and the ride is much better now I am coming down from a much heavier car that did have a nicer ride to it and it has taken a while to adjust | Quality craftsmanship every place I look everything is put together very well | I am a little disappointed that the trunk lid does not have a liner on it no computer and no intermittent wipers | 
 "words": This is my first hybrid but 5th Honda Civic | I briefly left the brand for a 2008 MINI Cooper S but quickly returned to Honda | The quality of the car pieces in my opinion or better then most luxury vehicles | Compared to my MINI without the sport package the ride in the Hybrid is quite and heavenly | The Hybrid in real world driving handles far better then my Cooper S | In the MINI hitting uneven pavement jerked the car around | The Hybrid hangs on to the curves with the same go-for-it'ness and absorbs bumps without drama | Per the OBC I avg 31 MPG in the Cooper S the first week I got 45 | 7 MPG in the Hybrid | None of my Civic's have left me stranded | This is why I returned back to Honda | 
 "words": Overall satisfaction is great just a bit upset about the MPG getting an average of 26 mpg with normal driving | Car handles very well and the steering is tight and responsive | Engine could use just a bit more power but still not bad | Cold morning start is a bit rough | Road noise is present but not too bad | Very reliable car wish it had a better warranty just for the piece of mind needs to be 5year 60k bumper to bumper especially for the price | 
 "words": Preface I did my homework and shopped around pretty extensively | I knew what I was buying an economy car and held the civic to those standards | First a few minor quibbles 1 | Thickness and durability of the paint is disappointing | I'm finding too many chips on this young a car | 2 | I can't locate the source of some random clunk coming from the right rear wheel | Other than that all I have for the civic is praise | The car handles famously considering its class and competition and the ride quality is uncompromised | It's solid doesn't get flustered over bumps and inspires much more confidence than my previous car a 1998 Audi A6 | 
 "words": I had purchased a 2009 Honda Civic EX and then decided I wanted the hybrid with everything | So I went back to the dealer and got the 2009 Hybrid w leather and navi in silver | They were giving about 4k in discounts so I couldn't pass it up | So far I like it better than my 09 EX because of the gas mileage and cool blue leather interior and navi | 
 "words": This car is real quick from 60-90 | Has some road noise but the 350 watt sound system can correct for it | This car is a real show stopper for 22K with at 7 sec 0-60 | A must test drive if you are looking at the IS 250-350 smaller interior or the Acura TL | The resale value makes the Si a real choice over the Subaru WRT which costs almost twice the price | 
 "words": On my first drive I was a little concerned about the Hybrid's ability to merge with traffic but very glad that I took the second drive and bought it | No problem in merging | I agree with First Honda that the Civic Hybrid too is a really fun and peppy ride | Also agree on the driver's seat being extremely uncomfortable | I too am 5'8 and have back issues anyways but there is no lumbar support on this vehicle | No problem with visibility and foot seems to remain on the pedal fine | 
 "words": Have had car for 3 weeks | At 862 in town miles overall mpg is 38 | 2 | should improve with break-in | MSRP 27520 paid 24580 below invoice | Excellent room in all seats for 6'2 190 lb | body | Very comfortable seats | Quiet and comfortable ride | Exceeds expectations | At price paid it's an outstanding value | 
 "words": I have owned my civic for 2 weeks | I did not test drive the car | I wish I did | I don't like the braking takes too long to stop | The wind takes the car | I had a 2002 civic I loved it | I just turned in my accord | I am so sorry I didn't get another one | I am stuck with it for 3 yrs | lease | 
 "words": I have been looking and test driving Civics for the last 2 years and finally decided on a Crystal Black Pearl Coupe it was on the showroom floor | I almost went with the LX-S but decided that for an extra 1300 I would rather have the sunroof UBS connection with a great stereo 4 wheel disc breaks | The car is very fun to drive and rides a lot better than the coupe a test drove | Will see how good the mileage is | 
 "words": I only have 600 miles on the vehicle but I really enjoy it so far | The gas mileage is increasing every tank full and I expect to easily exceed the 36 MPG rating for the car | I wasn't sure I would like the placement of the speedometer but I can't imagine driving a car with a conventional speedometer now | 
 "words": THIS IS MY FIRST HYBRID and it's only a day old or so | I wanted to write about my first impressions and a few months from now I'll write again | First of all the ride is smooth and solid | With the CVT SHIFTING IS SEAMLESS because there aren't any gears just one consistent motion | The style looks like a Civic so don't expect people to stop and notice your new Hybrid | However you can smile and know how your new car isn't thirsty for gas and the stereo is top notch | The interior leather is very comfortable and the blue luminous gauges have a futuristic look and very easy to read | We got a fantastic lease 305 36 month | Only first payment down plus they paid off our other lease 2months | 
 "words": Hondas just seem to get better and better | I do however have two minor comments regarding my new Civic | First the accelerator's new throttle-by wire technology performs well yet the feel of the accelerator is awkward to me | The pedal is hinged from the floor and I find it a little uncomfortable situating my foot at times | The other item relates to the transmission | The automatic tranny seems confused at times whether to stay in second gear or revert to first when executing slow turns or California stops | This confusion can at times result in an abrupt shift of the gears | Other than that not much to complain about | Hats off to Honda for building yet another great car | 
 "words": Let me start with I checked out just about everything out there in this price range and took my time making a decision as I did not need a new car but rather wanted one | After looking for over a year I decided on the Honda Civic EX 5 speed and so far am very happy with it | The car rides nice and handles very well for what it is I had Miata's and MG's before this the deciding factor was the Honda's resale value compared to everything else | If you are looking for a well built fun to drive and reasonable cost to operate car look at the Honda Civic | The EX model has all the toys you need sunroof 4 wheel disc brakes cruise and a decent stereo system | I paid 17451 including destination | Love IT | 
 "words": This is a fantastic car overall quite comfortable and very well executed | Just gave back leased 2005 civic and bought this one with all the items EX- L model | Surprised at how innovative this car is compared to the 05 and that's meant in the best way possible if shopping for a new car in this price range or even a slightly higher price range give the civic a drive you'll enjoy it | One piece of advice is to make sure you do your research on not just the car but the dealership | 
 "words": I have owned my Civic now for almost a year | I find it a fantastic car for the price | It will cruise all day long effortlessly at 70 mph and get me 38-39mpg with the AC off | Now it won't win any drag races but it has plenty of power for my day to day needs | I really like the dash set up and I think the auto transmission is very smooth | Lots of leg room also for my 6'4 frame | My two kids fit fine in the backseat | The trunk holds more then I had originally thought | I have had no mechanical issues in the 9500 miles I have driven the car and average 30-32 mpg in my daily driving | 
 "words": Really fun and peppy ride | The only problem I have is with the driver's seat | I'm 5'8 and find the seat extremely uncomfortable digging into my leg underneath and my foot falls off the pedal to the right | To be expected for a compact car I guess | I wonder whether it's just me or if others are having similar experiences with the car seat | Also there is no visibility in the front or back | Parking not easy | 
 "words": I had forgotten how superb Honda cars are | The Civic Hybrid w leather and NAV has all the features that my former Camry Hybrid had | at 10K less based on actual purchase prices | The Civic is a handsome design in out | My first tank returned 50 MPG average and I expect to do better over time | Polished Metal exterior was a great choice | This car is SOLID and a pleasure to drive | It FAR exceeds my expectations | 
 "words": So far so good | This car is everything that I expected | Great gas mileage 33miles gallon mix city highway | Not especially sporty or exciting to drive but to get to work and around town works well | This car doesn't accelerate from a stop very well but then this is part of the gas saving component | I believe a model equipped manual transmission would improve this and be more fun to drive | But for me not practical since I drive in stop and go rush hour traffic daily | This car does have a significant amount of road noise but no more so than other cars in its size class | One other item that is an annoyance the fabric black on my LX-S attracts lint and hair like a magnet | Is hard to keep clean | 
 "words": Bought the Civic LX-s because I liked the combination of features that it had for the price | The interior looked much better than the EX with the Si seats leather wrapped wheel | Audio is a little weak but it can be enhanced easily with aftermarket | Only filled up once and with a combination of city and hwy got 30 mpg | Road noise is a little more than I expected but ok | Instrument display is great handling is quick and acceleration is what you should expect for this class | Interesting to note that the Civic is now just about as big as the previous Accord that we had 1993 although it weighs a lot less | 
 "words": Honda makes one of the best stick shifts in the auto business with the Civic Si | Short throws and creamy smooth shifts | Performance is great for a 4 cylinder 2 liter engine without a turbo | It's a rev happy car which performs best at 6000 rpm's and the engine sound is sweet at higher revs | My car is black which is hard to keep clean but looks great when it has a bath | It's a head turner | Gave it a 9 on reliability but that's just based on Honda's past reputation cause I've only had it a week with 400 miles driven so far | I leased it for 3 years so it's covered by limited warranty | If it proves reliable I will purchase another 3 year lease | 
 "words": I traded a 15 year-old Saturn with manual steering and only 37000 miles so this car is a real treat | I did a lot of new car research and frankly don't understand some of the negatives expressed on Edmunds | The Honda is comfortable the two-tier digital speedometer is no problem the emergency brake handle is not a problem | Stereo CD player sounds great can't really tell about fuel economy yet had to warm it up a lot this winter | Variably intermittent windshield wipers would be nice but not a big issue | Took me 3 months before I had 600 miles to finally get to use the cruise control and it's fine | Some want a remote trunk opener on the key | Oh please I mean opening a trunk is difficult | 
 "words": I took this car for a ride on CA State Route 1 Pacific Coast | I have to begin by saying that I am not impressed | This car has a serious blind spot problem | Too much of blocking when you do a head check | Leather seats are of bad quality | Sound system needs improvement | I am 5'9 getting in and out is very uncomfortable | Audio unit gets heated up | Inside cabin is noisy | Wondering what would remain on 65MPH head on collision | I was shocked to see the design design beneath the bumper | I would rate safety features somewhere between 3 to 4 | AC units has problem | Not sure if I can recommend this car to my friends | 
 "words": 1 | Leather Seats are not good | I already see wrinkles Bad quality leather 2 | Bad pickup | 3 | Mileage is not as promised | 4 | Has 6 Speaker and 1 woofer but woofer is very bad Honda or the Dealer continue to claim it's good but it's not good | Creates buuurrrr sound at volume 9 | 5 | Definitely need re-engineering in all aspects | 6 | Buy EX-L if the on-road price is 14000 | 
 "words": So far I am pretty happy with my purchase of a Civic | Overall it's what I expected | There are a few surprising issues | Most notably the car has a tough time starting when its cold out under 20 degrees | I live in the Northeast and that has been rather often this winter | The windshield washer nozzles have also been freezing up since I've had the car | It doesn't handle well in the snow but I expected that since it's so light | I do like the reliability that comes with the Civic and it does ride well | Also the gas gauge seems to underestimate the amount of gas in the tank | I actually was driving with no bars on the gas gauge so I rushed to fill the tank and I still had about 2 gallons left | 
 "words": Just passed 15000 miles and still pleased | We average 36 MPG | The car is comfy | Four can travel on long trips without much trouble | Five is OK for short trips | Leg room in back is very good | I like the split dash as everything is right there | The road noise can get loud sometimes but it's mostly only noticed when the radio is off | If you want a solid fuel efficient US made worry free auto you can't go wrong with a Civic | 
 "words": I've always liked the Honda Civic | It's got great looks and the mag tests say it sets the standards for other small cars to match but I'm disappointed | The road noise in the cabin is just horrible with the Civic and for me it's really a big distraction that's keeping me from enjoying this car | Too much gear whine from the drivetrain too | Road noise in the cabin is the biggest flaw with this car | I like the rest of the car but it's not really any better than the other cars in its class and you pay more for a Honda and get less features for your money compared to say a Toyota | The Civic is a nice car but it's a noisy car and pricey for what you get | Do you homework before you buy | 
 "words": I've had my LX-S sedan for a few months now and all has gone well except for one persistent issue that has popped up since the weather has become cold | When the car has been sitting for a few hours in temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit the car will often not start on the first try or the car will start and then die out | The indicator window on the battery states that the battery is fine | On a brand new car this is unacceptable | Come on Honda don't skimp on batteries with decent cold cranking amps | 
 "words": I had purchased this vehicle after my friends told me it was good on gas | Well I got a civic 2009 EX and the MPG is horrible | I am getting 23 miles per gallon on this car | My tank is half empty with only 110 miles | I wish I can take it back for a more economical one | Not to mention the price | Too high for this car | Honda you're going cheap to improve gas efficiency on brand new cars | People you will not be happy paying over 20000 for this MPG | I am not a rough rider either | 
 "words": Got the dark gray color which meshes quite nicely with the Si wheels | The audio hookups are astounding CD XM pc card FM AM iPod and USB key | The navigation graphics are dated same or similar to those which debuted in 2006 but the system is integrated quite well and the information presented is all helpful | I have yet to get a single voice command to work even after reading the manual | The engine is quite free revving and the transmission and clutch combo is sublime | It is not a particularly fast car but the best version of a proven car with a fantastic stick |

 "words": The 2009 Civic Hybrid is a new reliable auto that seats 4 comfortably has great interior trunk space for a compact and gets 40-50 mpg | I live in San Francisco area and avg hwy speed is 70-75 | No noticeable difference in acceleration merging or passing from the v-6 Chrysler Sebring I traded in | The only difference is no squeaks shakes | Solid body and handling like the interior and layout very good sound system | Try it you'll like it |

 "words": I've been driving this car for over 2 months now and I just love it | The power is really good for a 4cyl and gas mileage is what I had expected good | What I love about it is that it didn't have to break my bank to get this nice cute car where you still look good enough to go on a date with and girl doesn't call you a loser for not driving a BMW Lexus or Mercedes | I really like the reliability of Hondas | I've had Hondas all my life but just before this I bought a Mazda Tribute Ford affiliated and I can tell you that Honda is a much better built cars | I will never buy anything else other than Honda for the value |

 "words": I've only had my Civic LX sedan automatic one day but this is one impressive car | I love the way this car looks handles and rides | This generation of Civics reminds me of the Accords from years ago and this is one thing that attracted me to the new Civic | I test drove an Accord LX this week and it was a great large car but the Civic's handling blew away the Accord's | Overall this car looks and drives like it should be far more expensive | 
 "words": My 2009 Civic LX feels as good if not better than my previous Mercedes C Class cars | The Civic is all grown up providing plenty of comfort and space | The build quality is exceptional | This car feels very solid yet eats up the local mountain roads | The handling feels planted and sure footed | The steering response is positive and easy to judge | Pure pleasure on a twisty road | My only complaint is the radio | The speakers lack dynamic range | They sound muddy | I believe that the LX is a 4 speaker audio without a tweeter | The bass and mid range are also not very clean and sharp | I have tried to adjust the bass and tweeter but the speakers stink | I love the Civic except for the speakers |
