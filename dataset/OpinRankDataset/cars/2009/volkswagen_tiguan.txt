REVIEWS
 "words": After researching what kind of SUV I wanted I decided on the Tiguan | Happen to be in Florida on vac they had a good deal I bought and drove the car to New York | Drive was a lot of fun | Vehicle seems solid firm ride | I get asked about it by passerbys | Brake is very responsive quite interior | Some minor issues I do have motorized driver reclining seat but manual pump lever to elevate and move seat | why not motorize all summer humidity seems to bring out a bad smell from air exhaust when it's not on a c engine is powerful but there seems to be a delay in responsiveness when u go from braking to quickly accelerating but then it eventually picks up when you press harder on the pedal
 "words": I got my 2009 Tig in may of 2008 before better deals were to be had | Oh well | I love the car itself | It has been great and I get complements on it all the time | People stop me to ask about it | I sometimes wish I would've splurged and gotten the one with the sunroof | The car is great in city and hwy and I'm amazed at how well it insulates outside noise | Feels very solid throughout | I agree with some comments about the black upholstery it is a hair magnet | I had an issue with a faulty fuel pump which was quickly replaced under warranty | That's been the only issue I currently have 11K miles in the Tig | 
 "words": After one year | I love the power handling and design of this car | I was looking for a sporty fast cuv that could still accommodate a three year old and all that entails | This car does that | That being said driving home from the dealer I noticed it was at night I could only see 3 ft ahead of me | Took car back to find lights were ill- positioned | 6 months later I had to get the fuel pump replaced | Already had to get burned out drivers head lamp replaced and there is an awful squeek inside that I can't seem to find fix | I like the car but am wary about what to expect in year 2 | Imo quality is really lacking | I am thinking of trading it in already which saddens me as it is fun to drive | 
 "words": I have had my new White SE Tiguan for 1 month and I am really enjoying driving again | I sold my 9 year old Camry and do not miss it one bit it was very reliable but BORING yet the gas mileage was great | I can't rate the reliability yet but so far I am very pleased and no real quality issues to address but I do agree that the Turbo is rather jerky at times and leaving from a stop light turning right it is jerky accelerating to get going almost like I am driving a stick in a low gear which I do not have the manual and I have no need or desire to use the shifting option | The dealer really came down on the sticker price I got the pricing below a comparable Honda CRV or RAV4 | 
 "words": I came from a Land Rover LR3 to a 2009 Tiguan | Love the same features of the Land Rover but disappointed about the room inside | I have 2 dogs and cannot fit much else except them | Also cannot get over the fact there are no armrests in the middle having to use the console seems odd | Also just ran over a nail on one of the tires and have to have it replaced | The 18 Pirelli's that are on the Tiguan are on national backorder odd sized tire as well | Not sure if they are good snow tires from what I have researched on the Pirelli website | Gas mileage not what I expected only averaging 21 mpg on the highway | Overall not quite sure I made the best choice | Should have stayed in my LR3
 "words": Traded down from a full size SUV to the Tiguan one month ago and absolutely love it | Getting about 20 22 mpg in mostly city driving so a really nice improvement from 13-14 previously | Car drives very sporty plenty of room inside for a 6' 4'' driver with kids in the back seat | Styling and design are good | My kids like riding in this car better than the BMW 5 series | 
 "words": after 3900 miles my EPC warning light appeared on the dash | Acceleration was lost and the car sporadically regained power only to lose it again | A few days later the Engine Malfunction icon also appeared | The car is now destined for a few days in the shop | 
 "words": Shame on us for not taking a closer look at the car during delivery after we arrived home we noticed holes in the front bumper | Apparently the car was transferred from a dealer in a state that required front licence plates in Michigan they are not required | First call was to the dealer sorry nothing we can do but good news we do have a new bumper in stock if you would like to buy a replacement | Well OK then | So step two call VW customer support | They happily assigned a customer advocate who called the following day | To quote sorry but this is an issue between you and the dealer there is nothing we will do | WOW what a great case study poor for customer support | 
 "words": I suppose I had higher expectations since my other vehicles are classy sedans or coupes | Going from a sedan or coupe to one of these SUVs is not something a driver would be happy with | It's great for tossing large objects into but even then a minivan is better suited to people that want to haul stuff including people | Otherwise it's just another L on wheels | 
 "words": I researched a number of crossovers | Ford Edge Mazda cx-7 audi q5 nissan rouge toyota venza ford escape saturn vue honda crv | The Tiguan was the one that gave me the best value the best handling free scheduled maintenance and VW reputation | The back seat is comfortable for adults to ride | The cargo space is awesome | 
 "words": This vehicle is awesome | The drive is very tight for its class and the appointments are similar to my Passat 4-motion wagon | The 4-motion is a definite plus and the ride is superb | It is definitely not a car for the everyday Joe or Jane and thats the way my wife and I like it | I can't imagine a 200 HP Rogue Rav4 or CRV | I feel this vehicle sits similarly to a land rover but with a lower more stable center of gravity | There are no unnecessary and gaudy amenities which would push up the price for many other makes | Plus its a VW and you can't touch that | I do wish that a diesel version was available but I'll just have to wait hope and wish for the 2011 model to be a TDI | 
 "words": I bought my Tiguan after several months of looking at small SUV's | Each time I kept coming back to the Tiguan | I thought I would get a CRV but the power isn't there and there are far too many on the road | I wanted to like the Acura RDX as an Acura TL owner | While I liked it the gas mileage poor and cost high prevented the deal | The Ford Escape Hybrid just didn't have the fit and finish | The Tiguan was the best bet for me good value my bike fit inside still somewhat uncommon on the road nice looking and just a great all around package | Six weeks into it and I still love it as much as the day I bought it | 
 "words": I have driven 30000 miles in the deserts of Las Vegas and get 22 -23 MPG aroung town and 26 28 on the highway | I have had the services done and am sitting at the dealer having the 30 mile service performed as I write this | Th rear brakes need to be changed at 270 and the front are still 80 | All the tires are still good | 30000 miles and the front brakes are at 80 this is awesome | Look up brakes on the Toureg and you will see every 15k to 20k miles at 4 times the cost of the Tiguan | This SUV has been flawless you cannot go wrong | I test drove the CRV and love the looks however the interior seemed cheap and the ride was not as quite | I cannot praise the vehicle enough | 
 "words": All in all very happy with this new purchase coming from a BMW I have high expectations but I was surprised with how much I liked this CUV | Has enough pep on the highway with the added turbo that I don't realize it's only a 4 cyl | Interior is very classy and comfortable definitely has a luxury feel | 
 "words": After almost a year and a half of research I finally decided to go with the VW Tiguan | Moving from a Ford Explorer AWD V8 this is definitely a change | The Tiguan is lower so its height is somewhere in between a mid-size SUV and a car | The ride is great considering the wheel-base yet still offers plenty of room for four adults to travel comfortably | The 4 cylinder has obviously less power but it'll move when it's needed | I was initially worried about cargo space and while it is certainly smaller than what I'm used to it allows for most common trips the store without having to put the seats down | All in all very pleased | I'm hoping this vehicle lasts for a while | 
 "words": Build quality and performance are on the top of my list | Reliablity we'll see as time goes on but at this point everything is spot on with the Tiguan | Surprisingly nimble although the Michilein tires on the S model are not up to the handling capabilities of the chassis | At 6'4 comfort is not a problem in this CUV good leg and head room cargo capacity is as expected but much more than my sports sedan I traded in | Interior materials seats dash and carpets are very good quality as are fit and finish of the exterior | Color match on the rear fascia is slightly off color for the White Gold but not enough to complain over | 
 "words": Moving from larger suv but wanted all its features minus size | This suv fits the bill | Excellent fit and finish | The 4-cylinder turbo is the best of its class | The ride is stiff but ergonomically sound | The Tiguan has highest rating on all categories of safety including roof strength by the IIHS | Interior is thoughtfully planned out | You pay more for this vehicle versus the other small suvs out there but you get more | 
 "words": IMO the tiguan wins Best in Class | It is the ONLY vehicle in comparison that Ive found comfortable font and back for tall people | Im 6'4 and the Tig is the sweetest ride Ive tested outside of the full sized SUVs | Editors seem to only have two complaints the price tag is higher and it has marginally less cargo space | I cant argue the sticker but lets be honest | Yes that will sacrifice 2MPG but the solid acceleration and grip on the road is the benefit | Cargo space | If the difference is that important you should probably be looking at the full sized | Great VW | 
 "words": I moved up from a compact car to a compact SUV to accommodate my growing family and deal with the decaying CA roads | The Tiguan is right-sized for urban life in the Bay Area quite compact exterior for nimble driving and parking but a very spacious interior | In comparison Rav4 and CRV are weird dull dated | I had hopes for the Forester but the interior was extremely cheap read the reviews | The Tiguan is in a class of its own for build quality design and driving experience | More expensive yes but better value as I will be enjoying this for many years | The 2 | 0T engine is fantastic I feel I have the GTI from my youth wrapped in a responsible family package with all safety features | 
 "words": I have the SE level with the sunroof | There is no words to describe how fun to drive this car can be | The quality of materials is obvious along with the beauty of designs | Pick up is amazing and smooth and the suspension is the perfect combination between sport and sedan | Not only were the dealers at VW ready to deal the financing was great | I get compliments on this car all the time people stare at it on the road too | I am very happy I purchased a car that is not ubiquitous and that allows me the freedom to enjoy rides with the sunroof fully open | 
 "words": Top class car | Refined precise and hi tech | Options may add up the price | Very powerful fast and agile | 4 motion is awesome | Interior is incredibly classy | There is simply no comparison to this car at this time | 
 "words": My first SUV | I agonized over it because of the mpg | I needed a bigger vehicle but something smaller than the CRV RAV4 also with a nicer interior | I tried to love the CRV because my Civic was such a good car but couldn't | VW is built much better | The steering freaked me out a bit at first but I'm getting used to it | I don't understand why at times it feels disconnected from the car | It does drive like a car and I like the boost from the turbo engine | Headlights from larger vehicles no longer shine in my rear view mirror or to be deluged by water when larger vehicles would pass me on wet highways | Hopefully my love will continue to grow and I'll feel better about getting such low mpg | 
 "words": My car is only a moth old and they already replace gas cap due to engine light on | After a few months later another problem occur fuel gauge not working showing fuel tank not full | Number on the dash board keep changing and not accurate | 
 "words": I traded my 07 Altima SL in for this car and so far so good | I wish it had a few more bells and whistles for the price tag but other than that it's great | It's a little bit tight on interior space but for right now it's a good fit for my family of 4 | Seating is comfy has a descent stock stereo system with an ipod adapter | I got mine with the 3 years of free maintenance which will save me a few hundred | Overall I'm happy with this car | 
 "words": It's no GTI but for a CUV it is the best out there in its price range | Handling and composure on all road surfaces is excellent | Not skittish like the RAV4 V6 and better gas mileage than the Acura RDX | Fit and finish is better than the Honda CRV | Comfortable and quiet interior controls are simple and in the right places | The 2 | 0T motor is smooth and refined with plenty of kick when you need it | And don't be put off by the high MSRP as large discounts can be had | Flemington VW was awesome with no pressure and knowledgeable salespeople | 
 "words": Traded up from a 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix | I researched cars for about 6 months prior to test-driving and this was one of my top pics | If you are thinking of purchasing a Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav-4 be sure to check out the Tiguan before making your final decision | Driving this car is a lot of fun | I was very impressed with the overall quality I got for the price | 
 "words": I think the positives of this vehicle have been covered pretty thoroughly to this point | For me it was this or a CRV and the deal I received from VW just crushed what Honda was willing to do | Sticker on my SE was 29115 | Final purchase price was 25604 | Both of the preceding figures are pretax | I put 2000 down and financed the remainder 0 for 60 months | Honda thought I was making stuff up 3600 off MSRP plus 0 for 5 years | VW is definitely trying to move inventory I guess Honda isn't desperate enough yet | I absolutely love the vehicle though but I've only had it for a week so reliability is tough to judge at this point | Absolutely zero buyer's remorse to this point | 
 "words": This little SUV is awesome | Love the handling great pick-up | Stylish and unique I haven't seen another one on the road yet | Love it even more than my CRV which I never thought possible | I got the base model sunroofs get to hot in FL | but my dealership upgraded me to leather seats | With the tinted windows and wood-trim kit this ride is styling | People stop me all the time to ask about it | 
 "words": I traded my 2008 Nissan Rogue SL AWD ater 21K miles for this Tiguan SE 4motion because of the better features ride handling acceleration and build quality | The car is the best engineering product I have found in the market today for the money | VW truly is the best kept secret in terms of qualityfeaturesvalue and fun to drive | 
 "words": After much research on moving up from a zippy and efficient Mazda 3 and having test drove several competitors the new Tiguan stood out from the crowd | Am impressive array of features on the SE 4MOTION sports-type handling great vroom on the pedal comfortable surrounds AND VW of America's 0 financing make this perhaps the best deal in America | 
 "words": Wanted a GTI but rear seat room was just too small | Manual transmission and higher ingress egress makes this fit my desire for fun and my need for comfort | Would have preferred a manual transmission with the ability to also have nav sunroof heated seats and AWD but VW did not give me that option | I have found base 'S' model's cloth seats do not get as cold as leather seats so I have not yet gone to the aftermarket for heated seats | It is more quiet than my BMW and Chevy Tahoe | It tracks well and has lots of storage cubbies including a hidden one to the left of steering wheel | Drawers under the seats like the European models would have been nice | Bring on the TDI with a stick | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Tiguan which we picked up just in time to use the 4-Motion against New England snow | Incredible | Very sure-footed in this slop a real hoot to drive | The kids love the panoramic moon-roof | it is about as much exposure one can have to the sky without getting a convertible | The Tiguan's Xenon headlamps have peripheral sidelights which activate and illuminate the sides of the road whenever you make a turn | Very nice to have on twisting roads sharp corners dark parking lots city streets etc | The Tiguan is also a very quiet car for the small SUV CUV segment | No high pitched whine road-noise like I experienced with the Toyota RAV4 and CRV | 
 "words": We traded our beloved 2005 Jetta 2 | 5 for our Tiguan | I loved driving our Jetta but I have to say the Tiguan is more fun to drive | You can get into trouble with the police zipping around with this SPORT utility | Fit and finish is great | I'm a big fan of VW's electric steering very smooth | I like the nylon seats they warm up quick very comfortable | Visibility is good | I enjoy the sunroof can't wait for summer | AWD has been been great this winter | 
 "words": I bought the first Tiguan to hit Colorado in May | I have put 32000K miles on it and I love it | I am in sales drive 50K miles per year and insist on being comfortable | It is such a fun car to drive but I have picked up 2 speeding tickets since purchasing the car | The sunroof is great | 6 cd stereo is great | When I use Super gas I get 28mpg it drops to 23mpg when I cheap out on the gas | Stock tires are not so great I already need a new set | The car has a tendency to slide in the snow even with AWD breaks do need to be checked | Upgrade from the Sports Cloth seats I wish I had been warned that the cloth shows EVERYTHING and dog hair does not come off | 
 "words": An update to my original post in June of 08 | This car is still doing everything I expect and then some | I have used premium since day 1 and haven't thought different | This car still gets me roughly 26-27mpg goin 70mph down the highway I still love the comfort of the automobile drove to Myrtle Beach and back from DC and was very comfortable with 3 other adults luggage and 2 golf bags | The style is still cool and I don't regret one thing about this car | The quality is great the ride is smooth and its still fun for me | There is ample storage space I don't have sunroof and its VERY safe read the safety ratings that came out last year and see who was on top | Great car I love it | 
 "words": Picked up our new White Gold w Beige SEL 4-Motion a week ago but had to drive 4 hours to get it due to the non-availability of what we wanted in our area | Great vehicle and I broke a personal cardinal rule about buying a car the first year it's offered because I was so impressed with it | The rear-view camera didn't work but the techs at my local dealer found a loose connection behind the radio | They rebuilt the connection and it works just fine | There is also some wind noise from the roof rails | There is plenty of room and comfort front and back and the acceleration handling is fantastic | We'll see how the mileage works out as it breaks in over the next month or so
 "words": My 09 SEL has only been home 2 days | I must say going from the Touareg to the Tiquan was a step down for me | But the cost of gas plus the 1800 brake job on the Touareg made up my mind quick | I think dealers should disclose the high cost of maintenance | You can rest assured I checked out the cost to replace brakes on the Tig | I love all the features | Opted not to have the nav sys | Rather use my phone nav | Have everything else | With the limited supply and end-of-year incentives they were gr8 had to settle for the blue-pretty though | The only down side I experienced was the negotiation at the dealer | I HATE that part of purchasing a car | Otherwise I am happy so far | Happy Drivin VW Folk | 
 "words": Purchased the Tiguan in Aug 2008 and now have 5000 miles | Two round trips to north of Atlanta and no problems | No problem passing a vehicle or entering the Interstate just put the pedal to the medal and this baby scoots | Many great compliments about it's sporty good looks | Just fun to drive | My wife has no problem getting me to run errands | My heavy foot may be the cause of the not so great gas mileage I've heard other reviewers reporting | Only about 25mpg average
 "words": First VW since my 1974 rust bucket bug | Love the power handling utility and the price | I bought the base model with the manual tranny | This is one really fun and tight ride | An excellent balance of comfort and crisp handling | I have owned an acura Nissan Chevy Ford and nothing compares to the quality so far | I know VW critics abound for good reason and that is why I bought the extended warranty but I have known quite a few VW'ers who have had good luck w their vehicles | Don't know what noir authentique is talking about with the cargo area is useless comment but this is a compact with very Nice interior room for the passengers and I fit 9 full size cases of beer in the cargo area | 
 "words": I normally do not rate a vehicle until I have 30K miles on it but I just had to share my pleasure with this vehicle with you | I currently have 8K miles on this SE with no problems | I'm a salesman and I'm on the road alot for my job hauling good size samples | Not as much room as my previous 4runner which my wife now drives but enough room to get the job done | Back seat room is larger than you would think and the rear split seats fold down flat which works well for me | Really a nice ride fun to drive gas mileage as advertised and the 4motion has really been a champ in this tough Midwest winter | I drove about everything in this class but I kept coming back to the Tiguan | 
 "words": Overall still in love | Like others really enjoy the zip and the handling | Would like more range of motion in seat adjustments especially thigh support | Panoramic roof is very nice but noisy in any position compared to Acura's small SUV | Haven't tested the 4motion much but on wet road has done very well very stable | I would like to see more audio controls on steering wheel such as change mode and channel | 
 "words": I loved the looks and still do but I have had this thing in the shop 4 times transmission engine light major vibration at highway speed twice | I spent a great deal of time researching before I bought a VW | I wish I had paid more attention to a few reviews that I had seen referencing quality problems | I feel like I have no choice but to sell before the warranty runs out | 
 "words": I just picked up my new 2009 VW Tiguan SE 4Motion | What a great little CUV | Yes I compared it with all the other little utes | Really it came down to this or the Mitsu Outlander for me in terms of features for the money | That was a great car also but just can't compare to the build quality or upscale feel of the Tiguan | If I was 20 again I would go with the Outlander | Now in my 30's the Tiguan's the ride for me | It was hard to find one with the new Nav system which is super cool and the giant sunroof also super cool but I am glad I did | Has just the right balance of power and fuel economy but it is a blast to drive | Drives a lot more like a car than a RAV4 | Test drive one | 
 "words": The Tiguan is comfortable easy to drivewell thought out reliable | Makes road trips something to look forward to | VW got this right kinda reminds me of the fun I had with my old VW bus | 
 "words": Coming from a 2002 Toyota RAV4 which was 100 reliable I can say this so far has not been the SUV I imagined | The test drive went well at Potamkin VW | I like the interior and exterior design- typical clean design | The interior has a few cheap pieces but you get used to it | On par with the Toyota | The inside is quite roomy but the seats are not so comfortable | Cargo area is useless | With 4k miles- the power around town is peppy but it lacks power on the highway | I also notice the gas goes quicker than expected | It should average 21 MPG and I barely see 15MPG average | On the highway I have seen 23 with the cruise set at 60MPH | Around town it dips to 12-13MPG | Overall not the best small SUV | 
 "words": Just drove home our brand new Tiguan | Extremely happy with our purchase | Solid car with quiet ride and comfortable drive | The power of 2 | 0 liter turbo compared to other Crossover SUV's in its class outperforms the blender-type engines of the smaller 4 cyl | competitors | The full sunroof with automatic screen shade ads a touch of class to the features | Body style says versatile yet sporty | Plenty of room for stroller or Golf Bags with the fold down seats | After countless hours of research on the internet and test driving all options this is the one | Get your hands on a Tiguan before showrooms run out we got the last one on the floor for the trim we wanted | 
 "words": Owned 3 mo | 3000 mi in gld-metallic | Researched all SUVs in class | was wowed by Tiguan | Interior styling in class by itself | handling comfort exceptional | Cabin durability very impressive | Passengers rave about roominess styling | Ride not smooth on freeways rather bumpy at times | Novelty retractable screen panel under sunroof does not fully block overhead sun glare | Trunk | storage tray on website never materialized rear underneath storage very ltd | Headrest has no tilt adjustment only vertical and tips head in uncomfortable position if you lean back | Miss my Acura | s Bose stereo | the sound of the system is 6 of 10 at best | Main center console storage could have been expanded | 
 "words": I've driven mine for 2000 miles so far and it's been great | High build quality very good organizational design quick pickup decent gas mileage excellent handling and braking quiet top crash safety ratings | No complaints | 
 "words":  and its already in the shop | Evidently the radiator fan doesn't come on when the car is idling | Its quite a sight to see the engine temperature gauge go from 190 to 260 within 3 minutes | Another example of VW's world renown quality or just an isolated incident | Who knows | Just be aware | Up to that point we were waiting to be towed to the nearest dealership I would have to agree with everyone else's initial impressions | It seems like a quality car handles like a much smaller car and is just a pleasure to drive and use | The tight design of the exterior really belies what is a comfortable interior | 
 "words": Not quite sure why everybody wants to see leatherette as an option | Who wants this fake stuff | I'm so glad I have the cloth seats | Neither cold in winter nor hot in summer this is a blessing in Chicago plus it's got heated seats | I love this car though it eats a lot of gas compared to the AUDI A4 2 | 0T CVT | I drove 30 mpg with same engine in the Audi and get barely 23 24 with the Tiguan | Tranny does not help at all | CVT or DSG VW S-tronic AUDI is the way to go | AISIN tranny from the Tiggy eats up more gas also my AUDI was FWD which was more gas saving but this is why I bought the 4motion just in time b4 winter | Otherwise I'm REALLY PLEASED so far
 "words": Just picked up my wife's 2009 Alpine Gray tiguan with nav and panoramic roof | Wow | This vehicle is fast | Stops on a dime | And is surprisingly comfortable | My wife keeps referring to it as awesome | She loves it | It is a gti in disguise | In my opinion | Build quality is superb | VW and Audi have a winner on their hands in my opinion | Not for the faint of heart | A must drive before you buy anything else | 
 "words": We test drove all the small SUVs out there and when we drove the Tiguan there was no comparison | First off I noticed the power was better than even the competition's V-6 models | The fit and finish is exceptional | I love German engineering | The handling is great the cabin is very quiet the sunroof is nothing short of spectacular | We bought this vehicle for my wife and I usually drive a BMW but love any opportunity to drive the Tiguan | I don't have to use the manual shift feature as this transmission shifts beautifully in the automatic shift mode | Had this vehicle 3 months now and am looking forward to driving it this winter | Just plain love the fun drive | 
 "words": It has the same 2 | 0 turbo and transmission that were in my 2006 Passat which provides all the acceleration you need along with a smooth performing 6 speed transmission | Also has the same excellent standard radio CD mp3 that was in my Passat | Matter of fact any Passat 2006-8 owners will find a number of similarities in the Tiguan | While the SE and SEL with options might be a little pricy the Tiguan S with automatic is a bargain considering all the standard features and build quality | I tried some of the other 4 cylinders with a few miles better mpg but they didn't stack up to the 2 | 0T | and even though Consumer Reports rates the Forrester higher you have to spend about 2000 more than th

 "words": I love the 2 | 0 Turbo in the Tiguan | Had the same engine in my 2006 Passat and love both the engine and transmission | The transmission is smooth and the turbo gives you that needed boast in passing or that extra acceleration you need when you | re entering a busy highway and beats out all the competitors when it comes to acceleration | A little pricey but the Tiguan S isn | t badly priced considering all the standard features and the quality of the build | The interior is nicely done and has actual aluminum trim vice the aluminum looking plastic you find in the competitors | Didn | t ever care for the color red but the Black Cherry Metallic which I purchased is exceptional | 
 "words": I was researching the market for several months and nothing really convinced me until I came across the Tiguan | I have one for about two months now and I'm loving every minute of it | It is fun to drive the engine is wonderful a lot of small features that make this the perfect car | Plus it has the highest possible safety rating and it looks just amazing | Fuel economy is actually better than advertised 20 27 | 
 "words": Great car with many usable features | Drives great and has plenty of pick up to merge onto highway | The build quality is excellent | Owned an Audi A- 4 cabriolet before and the panoramic sunroof is excellent | The SEL package has all the need to have comfort features | It is a head turner all the time | The cargo room is plenty for almost all your shopping needs | The Sirius radio is a pleasant surprise as we haven't played any CD's yet | The Wild Cherry color and 18 wheels make for a good looking car | Spend many hours researching the cars in this class and the Tiguan won even though it is more expensive | The gas mileage has been a little low however the foot in the turbo may the cause | 
 "words": Purchased two weeks ago and have been very happy with the quality and features of the SEL package | It stands out from the competitors with its exterior and interior design | Get many comments about it whenever we are out in it | Drives and rides very good plus the 2 | 0 gives good acceleration when merging on the highway | The roof was not on the wish list but is a nice feature | Spent hours researching all the other competitors models and felt this Tiguan stood out | So far only one gas fill up and was mainly city driving gas mileage to be determined | The build quality seems to be very tight the heated seats are very comfortable it drives great and has excellent power | So far a great buy | 
 "words": I was in the market to buy a new car | I'm only 21 but I do my research I wasn't about to blow my money and money that my grandma had given me for a car | It came down to a Vue 08 or a Tiguan the Vue was roughly 4000 cheaper but after long nights of thinking about the reviews on this website on the vue and the tiguan I decided to get the tiguan bought one on 9 12 08 | I'm so glad I made the right choice it is so much fun to drive and so far I have only had one problem which is the sat | radio it has nothing to do with vw it is some technical issue with Sirius that is supposed to be fixed in a week | I really have nothing but good things to say | Great SUV | I will write an updated review later
 "words": I've put a little under 3000 miles on mine and love it so far | After hearing everyone here rave about the sunroof I kinda wish I would've bought the next trim level up but it was a little pricier | Also I think the bigger wheels look better | Fuel economy is good for this size vehicle but if they ever bring the TDI version that will be awesome | I don't know what the MPG would be on that but the TDI Jetta gets close to 44 MPG | I would consider trading the gas for the diesel with those kind of numbers | 
 "words": Just recently got my Tiguan and what a smooth and zippy ride this is | No problems except the hazard light button was defective and nonfunctional | I'm about to go get it fixed at the dealership | I just hope they got their electronics problems fixed by now |
