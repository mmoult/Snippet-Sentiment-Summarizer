REVIEWS
 "words": I have driven the car for 4 months traded in a ford truck | I drive 6 miles each way to work and my driving is 1 2 highway and 1 2 city | I'm a decent driver and my mileage is only 19-22mpg at the most | The headrest is uncomfortable otherwise the car is satisfactory | I feel very uncomfortable with the blind spots-the right triangler window and the rear window-are starting to feel like they are safety hazards | I regret having purchased the car because of the blind spots | 
 "words": Switching over from a Chevy Equinox this car has been amazing | I have no real complaints about the car | It has 9000 miles and has only been back to the dealer to have a sunroof put in and for oil changes | I do see other peoples concerns with the awkward shifting but it isn't anything that really bothers me personally | The fuel economy says 24 but if you don't drive hard I easily have cleared 27-28 in the city | Great crossover for the reasonable price | 
 "words": With every day 8 miles run to work and back home it gives me only 20MPG | Blind spots are awful rear window is way too small backing up is a pain | I understand now why my insurance went up after I gave up Jeep Liberty for Rogue | That small orange round shaped computer screen is annoying after a week of looking at it it's so cheap and like an alien to the rest of dashboard | Suspension is weak to my taste | Lots of road noise when on poor pavement | With high speed and gusty winds vehicle behaves strange least | When you close your door it sounds like something loose inside | Ignition access key is huge and ugly | Steering wheel cruise | ctrl buttons speakers sound are poor quality | Etc | 
 "words": I needed to replace my Infiniti QX4 and tried an 08 Altima SL which was a nice car but I desperately missed having AWD | After a bad winter I traded it for a Rogue SL and am very happy | I didn't lose much in terms of MPG and gained a lot in terms of riding higher and having AWD again | It is comfortable has all the bells and whistles i got used to driving the Infinite with a little more affordable payment | 
 "words": After studying all the compact SUVs we decided that the Rogue was just what we needed | It had good mileage for this class of vehicles and in fact we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road | It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage wildlife surveys kayak in-putting etc | In addition it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway | Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested | Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue | Bigger is not always better | After 4 months and 5K miles zero defects | 
 "words": Love the car but only had it 4 months and it needs a transmission | Read the blogs and don't trust the dealerships | We've been driving Nissans for 15 years and can't believe what a Lemon the Rogue has turned into | 
 "words": We have the car less than a month and its been back to the dealer twice | First for a faulty low tire light issue and presently for a major computer harnessproblem | they don't know yet | With that aside and the few miles that we did put on the vehicle it is unimpressive | It's an overpriced vehicle without the problems | 
 "words": I have had this car about 9 months now | I should have bought a used luxury for the price | If you have a family larger than 4 forget about space in the hatch there is no room | Makes a lot of noise on the express way | Not fun to drive in winds at high speeds | Handles like a gem in the snow and ice | 
 "words": We leased an AWD SL and have had the vehicle for about two weeks | So far we are well pleased | We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron | I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25 | 4 It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over | I love the exterior design | It performs adequately for us | I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting | I'm well pleased with this vehicle thus far | 
 "words": I have had the Rogue for 2 weeks now and absolutely love it | I was really wanting an Audi Q5 but could not get the payments to work | I had a lease with Nissan for a Frontier and they took it 3 months early | I have test driven before the basic model hence why not excited to get this | The got me a fully loaded Rogue with leather and everything | The SL is such a difference | I live in the mountains so right off the dealership was from denver to Aspen | It handles great at low speeds and tightens up at higher | really fun with all the technology in there too | I love it and is so much fun inside and out | 
 "words": Car taken back to Nissan today | They were forced to take it back after it was titled 'Lemon' by the BBB | Had 2 replacement transmissions by 5000 miles and still had same problems | Rogue also had air con' replaced | Leaked transmission fluid etc | See Forums on this site for further info' | 
 "words": There is no perfect small suv crossover | The Rogue holds less cargo than a Foresterhas one row of seats less than a Rav4lacks the visibility of a CRV | However it is perfect for me | The fit finish is great as is the engine | It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof | In many ways this car is very basic- no leathercompass or elec | locks | But it has such personality | It has a nice reareach color pops and looks silky even those orange ones | The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well | I had owned a Chrysler product went back to shop- Patriot Compass Liberty are all inferior products as is the EscapeImpreza 09Equinox | 
 "words": Seems a lot of reviews are from folks that got duped into buying the Honda CRV or the Toyota | The Rogue has everything and it all works | The rear window is small but unlike the Toyota there isn't a spare tire in the way or the Honda has three headrests | Any way if you want a perfect car keep looking as they will never exist unless you are a consumer reports fan and then go buy the boring car CRV and wish you hadn't but when you get upset grab your copy or CR and tell yourself its reliable | 
 "words": We have had this car for 3 months and we love it soo much | We don't drive very much but it seems we always find an excuse to take it for a spin | Car has everything we wanted | Sunroof very easy to use and with the deflector added makes it even better | Like the trip computer as u can keep track of mpg or how many miles u have left before refueling | 
 "words": I have read numerous reviews that are all so positive on the Rogue | I really feel like I am missing something | I have only had the car 1 week and I am sooo disappointed I REALLY WISH I could take it back | My main issue is the Huge design flaw and I believe it's also in the Murano which really wasn't too much better slightly bigger way more the rear windshield is too small | The back seat headrests block the sides of the rearview window | This Crossover drives like a cheapy made compact car | My other auto is a Sonata and that has a far more quieter smooth ride | I did Not expect this auto to ride so roughmy 06 Pathfinder had a smoother ride | Rate this auto a 5 all around | 
 "words": We kind of got duped into this lease | Here's my list I'm short and the Rogue has VERY cramped leg room for the drive it actually makes me a nervous wreck the head room is also tight the steering wheel barely tilts | The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable and I have the leather package no adj | head restwhich also block visibility no seat adj in the back either | The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility | No matter if you like how it drives or not it is simply unsafe to drive | This long time Nissan owner can not WAIT for the lease to end it's only 1 mo in | 
 "words": Have wanted an SUV for a long time but have driven paid for cars for a while | Decided to make the jump to a new car and payment but I don't drive all that much so didn't want to make a huge investment | The Rogue gives me the SUV for a reasonable payment | Handling and styling are great have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more | VERY satisifed overall | Need to be a bit cautious on lane changes due to blind spots caused by small side windows towards the back working on mirror adjustments and not changing lanes as much | Engine has a lot of oomph and the ride is really smooth | 
 "words": Overall this is a good family vehicle | Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2 | 5S had | To me there's nothing fantastic but I'm a sports car fanatic | The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though | Also does handle pretty decently for a tall vehicle | Some of it's braking components and suspension aspects are shared with the Sentra SE- R Spec-V | 
 "words": Drives like a car smooth drive and just fun to drive | Great buy for your money | 
 "words": I have had this car nearly a month and all I can say is wow | I replaced my much loved Pathfinder with this and I could not be happier | Yes I lose space and some off-road capability which I did not use much anyway but the handling is terrific | I feel like I am in a sports car | Now I look for excuses to drive and I can because it uses a lot less gas than my Pathy | I totally recommend this little crossover to anyone who needs utility with a great sporty ride | Buy it for the fun of it | 
 "words": Excellent driven experiencelike other Nissan that I have hadAltima X Terra | Incredible power for a 4 cilynder engine | 
 "words": Had the car for two months now with 4000 miles on it | I am getting 27-28 mpg with 50 stop and go 50 highway | Still cannot wait each time to get in and drive it | The engine is quite peppy for a 4 cylinder | The center console and glove box are cavernous | Sound system is adequate but don't get the premium package just for the Bose sound | Not worth it | Love the steering wheel controls and 6 CD changer and AUX audio jack | Styling is much better than a CRV or RAV4 | Nissan engineers did great with the fit and finish of the car as well as user errors such as turning off all int | ext | lights after 5 minutes if accidentally left on | 
 "words": Just leased the S version with AWD | As it is built on the Sentra chassis and I previously owned a 2007 Sentra it improves tremendously on that cars driving feel and performance | Steering feel is MUCH better | CVT takes some getting used to but overall I like it in the early going
 "words": At first glance the rogue's didn't really appeal to me maybe because I always seen a base model one s around town | After going to the dealer and seeing an loaded up sl model I feel in love with this suv | After owning 10 suv's in the past and also being a wholesaler I have driven a lot of midsize suv's and honestly im my opinion this is truly amazing | It rides so Nice corners like a Porsche and gets gas mileage like a civic | I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": My wife and I traded in a 1999 Mustang | She called me on her way home from work and said we were going for a drive | She said I am not driving this car one more day | She drives it daily and is very happy with it | She loves her daily 20 mile commute now | We have taken it on two weekend trips and it is an excellent road car | There is more than enough room for luggage and us to ride in comfort | I would highly recommend Nissan and the Rogue to anyone who asks | Our experience at the dealership was also very good | 
 "words": On the 2009 AWD SL the dash passenger driver side trim around the vent reflects into the side mirrors sunny day or cloudy and is a huge distraction when looking to change lanes | Going to cause an accident | I brought this to the dealers attentions which the service area blew it off i called corp and they could care lessthe only person that made any effort to help render was the sales person | NISSAN listen up and don't bring out the vent so far on the dash and this will get rid of the problem | 
 "words": Traded in my 2001 Mazda tribute | I wanted something between a car and my SUV | Thus The Rogue | I had a chance to take it out for an hour on the hwy | It was great | At first I left the radio off to hear the possible noise issues other have said | After I stopped focusing on the noise | No problem for me | Lots of pick up | NOT going to miss my Tribute | The Rogue takes corners so well | I can feel that car feeling | Love the option from automatic to manual shifting | Works well for that extra kick you might need the odd time | If your more aggressive you would tend to use this more so | I did push it around the corners getting off the hwy | Did very well | hugged the road
 "words": I love this vehicle but two things that irked me and others I have met online is the ridiculously expensive cost to put side rails on top for storage | In order to get this feature you have to pay 1000 dollars US | This is silly and nonsensical | 
 "words": This is the fourth Nissan we have owned | I like the style AWD and reliability | I wanted a car that was good in the snow as I drive a long way to work | It proved itself one morning in a snowstorm | Nice traction and riding when slippery | Good on gas too | 
 "words": I am impressed with the exterior very nice design giving the feeling of a luxury vehicle | The interior is basic but also attractive | Some things I found to be missing that were bothersome to me were volume control on the steering wheel one-click power- up window control there is one-click down but not upand auto headlights no navigation system | The seat adjustment controls power steering and dash controls are basic | These features may be available if you purchase the premium package | The Rouge handles nicely although it is loud upon acceleration and it is noticeably a 4 cylinder vehicle | The new technology transmission takes getting used to the car can feel a bit put-put | 
 "words": Purchased two Rogues over the past 3 months | One is SL AWD with everything but leather package and the other has everything | In general the cars ride smoothly but can be noisy at wide open throttle | Highway merging is not a problem with the QR25 | A good first attempt by Nissan in the cute-ute segment that needs a few improvements | 
 "words": We just bought this car and are absolutely in love | We upgraded from a WRX we have a 1 year old and needed more room | My only quirk is the speedometer | I like having the numbers at every 10 MPH and a definitive line at the 5 marks | most of the speed limits here are 25 35 45 | everything with a 5 | But that's just my personal quirk | The view through the back is smaller then I am used to but i don't find that its too small and have no trouble backing up | It is comfortable and fun to drive and much easier to transport a 1 year old and all of his gear in | 
 "words": We absolutely love this vehicle | We had looked at the Honda Civic but this is head and shoulders over the Civic | It's much more stylish and a joy to drive | Very reliable we've had no problems with ours at all | A great vehicle | 
 "words": Easier to drive than my CRV and just as peppy | My wife wanted this one and I enjoy driving it myself because I'm 6'2 and I fit | It drives well on the road and buzzes around town easily | We tested all the SUV's this size and the CRV was tops but this one could easily be someone else's top rated | 
 "words": We bought the new Rouge in April '08 | At about 5500 miles we started hearing the NOISE | The service tech couldn't hear it at first | I did get it to make the sound and he heard it | He then drove it and he said he got it to do it worse | They contacted Niaasn tech line | They said that they were aware of the problem | The sound got worse and at 6800 miles they replaced the Trans | This would be the second transmission being the first came in the car | Then at about 12000 miles it reappeared | they didn't hesitate to replace the trans | The service manager could only say that it must be fixed but he could not guarantee it is a fix | I'm sorry to say that the trans is already grawling | 
 "words": I just drove my new Rogue SL off the lot and I must tell you it's fun to drive sexy and I absolutely love it | My 2006 CRV SE was coming off lease so I was looking for a smooth ride comfort and curb appeal | This vehicle will not disappoint you | If you've looked at the CR-V Rav4 Subaru Forester and can't make up your mind | take one of these for a spin | You'll love the room fold-down seats rear storage compartments | 
 "words": I love my Rogue so much | I waited for a year until my lease was up to get this vehicle | It is my first SUV and I could not be happier | I got all the features that I wanted from the Wicked Black paint to the Leather seats and AWD | It makes me happy every time I get into it and take off down the road | 
 "words": We just bought this car and it is a thrill to drive | I love the CVT very peppy and smooth 0-60 | I researched and tested Rav4 Volkswagen Mazda etc | and none compared to the Rogue style value | I traded a Pathfinder only due to poor gas mileage but have always loved Nissan quality | This car looks awesome and is a blast to drive | It is very nimble and responsive | you don't even notice that it is a 4 cyl | I chose the AWD because we are moving back up North in a few months | I was impressed with the 5 star crash rating | I couldn't be more thrilled with this crossover | 
 "words": I'm satisfied with my Rogue | Really glad I got an AWD since it performed better than expected in the deep show | Fuel economy is the biggest disappointment 20-21 mpg on the highway | I've driven 6000 miles in 6 weeks and never got better than 21 mpg | For the 4 cyl this is lousy | Radio is average and the car has only one power plug | No vanity mirrors oh well | I can replace the radio and add accessories but the gas mileage is a problem I did not expect | 
 "words": I am very thrilled to be the new owner of the 2009 Nissan Rogue | It has a super slick exterior look | Although the interior could use some spice | Really miss the extra storage spaces that my old car had | I upgraded to the leather seats and highly recommend it | It is fun to drive very similar to my old car as far as how it handles | Very quiet and good gas mileage | The back window could be larger to help with vision however the side mirrors are a good size so I just need to get used to using my mirrors more | Overall great car and highly recommend it |

 "words": I was driving a 2002 Toyota Highlander which I loved but was ready for something a little smaller with better gas mileage | I thought I would end up with the toyota rav 4 or honda crv but there were things about each of them I didn't like | I didn't even know Nissan had the rogue model and then I saw it in the paper one day so I went to the dealer and drove the sl model liked the features the price was competitive it felt more solid and quiet than the toyota and hondas I tried | It has been just 3 weeks and I really like it | 
 "words": Own Mercury Mountaineer but wanted something to drive to work that got better mileage | Didn't count on this | Awesome interior hubby is 6'01 and needs lots of leg and head room he's got it | Comfortable roomy seats | Excellent turning radius | Great back seat leg room also and plenty room for luggage | Exceptional head room | Quiet almost no road noise | Smoother ride than our nephew's Honda CRV | We are both thrilled with purchase | Couldn't be happier | Enough to make this ol' grandma feel like she's really styling | Best of both worlds SUV style combined with fuel economy comfort and grace | 
 "words": After 12 years of driving my reliable beloved Toyt Corolla my husband insisted I get a car that he fits in | He is 6'04 and we compromised on getting a small SUV | I have never owned nor wanted an SUV | I literally researched and test drove the smaller SUVs for a year before finally looking at a Rogue | We both absolutely LOVE it | It is so smooth stylish comfortable and unique | I love the fact that my husband does not complain about sitting in my car any more since he has ample room | And most of all I love walking up to my car admiring the sleek exterior looking around and getting excited all over again that I am the owner of the coolest looking car on the parking lot | 
 "words": My friend was interested in the Honda CRV but I convinced him to test drive the Rogue because I have been driving the same Nissan SUV for many years | I also drove the Rogue and I was impressed with how quiet it was even at 80 mph | We test drove the CRV and the interior was noisy when driving 60 mph and the styling was not as slick as the Rogue | Although he was the one looking for a car we ended up each buying one | We bought the S model but upgraded to leather seats and they look very nice | 
 "words": Had two Ford Escapes from 2003 2008 | Both units were well built and very reliable | Gas mileage was 18mpg combined with our 60 40 city highway driving style | After 3 weeks the Rogue is returning about 25mpg which is a big improvement | The Rogue SL seating is very comfortable supportive | The ride is a nice balance between firm and cushion but never floaty | Six speaker audio is excellent | Cargo capacity is as expected for a CUV but adequate for 95 of our needs | Getting used to the CVT is easier than we thought | Very impressed so far | Hope Nissan service is just as good | 
 "words": Need high seats for my back wanted better gas mileage than my Acura MDX was giving me so I looked at smaller crossovers | Focused on Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4 and didn't love either | The Rogue was stylish very technologically advanced and I didn't think I was giving up much by going to it | So far so good | I got the premium package and leather | Very comfortable great ride and handling | Great bluetooth system which is important to me | Sound system is as good as you could want | I do not miss my MDX |

 "words": We absolutely love this vehicle | We live in WV and we are getting 25 | 4 mpg | Since we do have hills in WV the mpg for an AWD is great plus the functionality of the SUV | When driving our 4 cylinders in the past going up hill you could always hear them kick down to pull | When we purchased this we couldn't wait to see what would happen | You literally can not hear the transmission at all | The CVT is so quiet and unbelievable | We looked at Honda Toyota Kia and Hyundai | For us they just did not have the styling still square and not sleek like the Rogue | 
 "words": Honestly I never considered this car until my wife and I actually went shopping for a small SUV | We drove the CRV and just did not like that car and I love Honda | It wasn't comfortable and the design both int and ext was unappealing to us | Hence we went to the Nissan dealer to just see what they had actually to look at a pathfinder | We saw the Rogue sitting there on the lot and we were both intrigued | We talked to the salesman and decided to go for a test drive | The drive was beautiful | So smooth quiet and comfortable | The interior is so well designed | The Bose sound system is wonderful | This SUV walks circles around each and every SUV on the market in my opinion | Nissan is now 1

 "words": Wow | I got this car because I loved the transmission this car carries the same engine and same transmission as the Nissan Altima | 2 | 5L 170 hrs 175 torque | It faster saves more gas more reliable engine then the RV4 or Cr-V | Nissan Rogue won | On the turns it has better control and a smoother ride and a better suspension system for a smoother ride | If you hit a pot hole your steering wheal won't move | It's awesome | 
 "words": The Rogue handles extremely well for a smallish SUV and road comfort is very good | While styling is subjective the best selling point is a 20 min test drive | The stereo is exceptional in the SL and gas mileage was a big surprise | 
 "words": I was in the market for a small SUV | I was first considering a CRV and even though I heard about the Rogue I didn't think much about it until I saw an ad from Nissan so I decided to test drive one | I'm glad I did | I was so impressed that I purchased it immediately | Exterior is appealing | sort of like a baby Murano interior is nicely laid out very comfortable the fit and finish superb | Since I live in South Florida and do mostly highway driving I chose the FWD model | Handling and cornering are excellent and acceleration is surprisingly good for a 4-cyl | through the CVT | Most impressive is how quiet and solid the vehicle is at 70mph | 
 "words": I Bought a Versa 6 months ago and found that was too small because I have 3 kids and 2 of them need car seats | I looked trying to find a car seat narrow but I couldn't find it so I decided to change the Versa for a Rogue and we love it | I have more space for the kids and I feel secure |
