 "words": i have shopped around in the last few weeks looking for a new truck and i cant find anything i like better than what i have at moment the gmc sierra

 "words":  I purchased this o9 after the deals made it to good not to get rid of 05 Right from beginning i have had a vibration from rear of truck at 70 mph and up the dealership tried swapping tires with brand new truck same tires same result GM has told the dealership what to check as they had and am now being told that i have to live with it I would like to hear from anyone that has had similar problem Truck only has 2000 miles on it something isn't right
 "words": Since I got the truck there has been constant rattles from the dash | My rims are peeling | Piston slap | Vibration in steering shaft | More rattles | I like the trucks interior but I think I got a lemon 
 "words": I traded in a 03 Silverado on this truck I loved the silverado but this truck is wonderful it's smooth as glass | I tow a boat and a camper with no problems | The interior is finally where it should be | 
 "words": Purchased the SLT Z71 with 5 | 3L which replaced a 2007 SLE | Although not estatic with the last truck I couldn't pass up the repeat-buyer rebates on the '09 | The SLT interior is very comfortable and pleasing to the eyes and it's worth the upgrade from the SLE | The BOSE sound system is very good | Truck rides and handles nicely | My only complaints are a constant squeaking in the driver side door panel area which the dealer is trying to fix 18 tires that collect and throw rocks causing the exterior paint to chip and the soft paint | 
 "words": When I started shopping for a new truck I made a concerted effort to be objective | I drove them all | The trucks I test drove in this order were the Ford F-150 Nissan Titan Dodge Ram Chevy Silverado Toyota Tundra and GMC Sierra | I returned to test drive the the Ford and the Dodge | When it was all said and done | the GMC is the truck that stood out above all others | A combination of its appearance comfort features and just the way the truck felt and drove simply overshadowed the other trucks | This truck has plenty of power great ergonomics and I like the features | The 6sp Auto and 5 | 3L are a pleasure to drive and run as smooth and quiet as I expect a truck to be | Solid Truck |

 "words": I traded a 1997 Sierra with 215000 miles for an 2009 Sierra 4WD Z-71 crew cab after a search of every make out there | I should have went straight to the GMC dealer as I have not been disappointed | This truck rides handles like a car gets great mileage avg 17 | 1 in mixed driving and is loaded for comfort | I have had two issues addressed by dealer rubbing noise on drivers door and rattle in drivers seat belt system | Both fixed on first visit | This is not the least expensive truck out there but the looks fit finish and quality makes it a winner | 
 "words": Get the 5 | 3L with the six-speed automatic | Averaging 20 MPG over first 2000 miles 85 15 Hwy City driving | 20 inch wheels rims are ugly make for very smooth ride | Engine is very quiet with good power and shifts are very smooth | Quiet interior is a plus and the leather seats are comfortable | Plenty of power to pass without sacrificing economy | Use the manual shift overrride function to control downhill speeds | Wife likes the 6-way seats and adjustable pedals with the memory function for seat mirrors | 
 "words": Great truck to drive handles soooooo good | The 20in wheels is a great option to have | the 5 | 3l v8 is so smooth | I looked at Ford Toyota Dodge and I kept going back to Gmc I feel like I made a great choice | 
 "words": First new pickup in many years always had a used one around but primary vehicle has been SUV's until now | This truck has the Z71 off road pkg and the towing pkg that includes the 5 | 3L 6A upgrade | Overall the ride is good but the seats are not very comfortable for long rides | Iyt seems to have good power even towing a heavy load | Fuel economy could be better but I only have 4500 miles on it so that might improve some | I average 15 mpg with 17 being my best highway trip so far | On the down side it has a light rattle in the A C vent that I cant pinpoint but varies with fan speed and the rock chip protectors on the fenders are peeling off | But overall it seems to be a good vehicle |

 "words": I've had the truck just over a month and have 400 miles on it | It has the All-Terrain Pkg and the 5 | 3L engine | It is sooo much fun to drive | I love the Stealth Gray color | Gray when the sun goes down very metallic when the sun comes up | It has a great ride and a lot of toys to play with | Only one problem so far | I have the 18 chrome wheels | The spare is a 17 | Oh well somebody goofed | Will have to get it changed out in the near future | 
 "words": I sent three months looking at the various options | I came close to purchasing the Toyota Tundra | The 2009 GMC Sierra is golden | I have forgotten to turn it off when stopped at times becuase the engine is so quite | It rides like a luxury SUV | Functionality and features are great | Would like to have had the ITBC since it has the towing package | It handles a little bit looser than the Toyota but the power is the same or better | I went on some WV mountains on Route 50 and it pulled up just fine | It wanted to go a little too fast down the mountain so I downshifted instead of overusing my breaks which worked fine | I haven't towed my 8K trailer yet which should be the test | 
 "words": Get the 5 | 3L for sure | The six speed is great for 2009 | However adding a cold intake really helped with gear hunting at higher speedsalltitude and hills | No problems except I had a creaking noise from the undeside since new | Turns out I needed a whole new drive shaft | Have over 8K on it now and dont regret a thing | More room than Japanese trucks espcially in head room department | Never feels underpowered | I did add ICON DYNAMICS coil overs rear shocks and they make it handle amazingly with no ride loss | Get them you wont regret it | They leveled out the front too | 
 "words": I just bought this truck slt z71 1500 crew cab last week | The aesthetics are very nice in and out | Not quite as comfortable as my old truck but I assume that will take some breaking in | It has lots of little extras back up warning lights in the rear of the cab which I am still finding out about | Overall I am extremely pleased with the truck and highly recommend it | 
 "words": I purchased a SLT Crew cab 4wd with the all-terrain package | The finish on the truck is awesome and the chrome with the silver birch color great | I've gotten many compliments | I've been impressed with the mpg of around 20 | 5 and this truck handles great | My only issue is that my starter went bad 1000 miles | I found myself stranded on my way to the beach | GMC did take care of me and fixed my truck but I'm disappointed to have mechanical difficulties so soon | There are also not many parts available yet for this model | I hope this proves to be a dependable truck in the long run | 
 "words": I just returned from a 3000 mi trip with my new gmc | Great truck on the hi way with the 5 | 3 flex fuel engine and active fuel management | I could not tell when it shifted from 4 to 8 cylinders or back again Plenty of passing power and plenty of storage room inside for luggage etc | On Star and Xm radio are amazing | 
 "words": This truck has done nothing but impress me I just picked up the 2009 sierra 4wd z71 crew cab short bed | This truck is like a luxury suv but is a work truck at the same time | Great power awesome ride pretty good on gas im getting like 16 mpg right now | Beautiful looking truck great lines | Very pleased overall | 
 "words": I | ve had the truck for just about one month | At one month every other vehicle that I | ve owned has had at least one little problem or there was at least one little thing about it that I didn | t like | I haven | t had any problems nor have I found any thing I don | t like with the Sierra | It is comfortable and fun to drive | I did a mileage check that came out at 19 MPG | I drive 70 highway and 30 city | At highway speed 60MPH it is so quiet that I don | t need to turn up the stereo | The average load in the bed is 500 to 700 pounds and with that load the truck handles very well | 
 "words": I'm just pleased to death with my purchase | I got the SLE Crew Cab with the 5 | 3l ad Texas Edition pkg | I also got leather and all sorts of extras for 30k | Just looking at the truck is pleasing it's gorgeous I got the Stealth Grey Metallic with cashmere interior | I get comments all the time on it's color even my wife says it's beautiful | I wasn't aware that the SLT had a different interior layout but I do like the way mine looks | It could use some wood in the interior but that's all I'd add | The small details are impressive | The fit and finish is amazing | The tactile feel of everything is amazing the leathers it's just quality through and through | 
 "words": Traded in my 2007 Duramax classic body for this truck | It is the best truck I have driven | It's fun to drive great build quality | Great highway ride and good off road but sits a little low Handles ice and snow like dry pavement | I would recommend this to anybody loking for a change from the rough riding poor handling truck of a few years back |
