REVIEWS
 "words": By Far the BEST BMW I have driven yet | had two X5s and a 328ix | I got Black Sapphire on Black | loaded | The X6 3 | 5i has lots of power is good looking a real head turner rides like a car sportiness of a coupe and utility of an SUV | Quality build quality ride and a really fun to drive | Get one | it's worth it | 
 "words": Between my wife and I we have owned every BMW except a Z and this vehicle is by far the most fun to drive | Love the space and neat style | One friend after seeing it called it the batmobile | Just picked it up yesterday and can't wait to go for a ride today | I can't image how fast the 50i must be | 
 "words": Love the X6 I think it's worth the extra for the V8 plus residuals are better and the money factors were too | Only wishes would be 1 | Manual transmission Option Are you listening BMW | 2 | 5th seat middle seat in back and 3 | Handles above seats | I know it's supposed to be a coupe but c'mon we need handles | I get more stares in this rig than I did in my M6 convertible | It surprisingly also feels faster than that vehicle | Fun car SUV whatever it is I love it | 
 "words": Handles really well and is extremely comfortable with room for kids dog and luggage | Great family car with a lot more sport than an SUV previously had an X5 and this blows the X5 away | Downside is that it eats gas voraciously | Highly recommend for low mileage driver not an everyday commuter car unless you like supporting the local gas station | 
 "words": After 2 months and 2000 miles I can say that this is the most exciting BMW I have owned | The last two were sedans that drove great | But didn't have that extra factor that makes a car unique | The X6 has that factor | Incredible road manners great aspect from all seating positions incredible comfort and the best build quality in years for BMW | 
 "words": As owner of a car dealership I have the advantage of driving everything available in South Africa | So we owned a Q7 and a Range Rover Sport amongst others | We own a 2008 X6 3 | 5i sport and loved the driving comfort handling and general driving pleasure so much that I just bought myself a X6 5 | 0i sport | For me being a lover of sport cars this is the real deal | It's like owning a sports car on steroids | We agree out of all cars we enjoy these two cars the most | So wife drives one and I drive one because not much else appeals so much | So no matter what people say about the looks fuel consumption and so on go drive the thing and you will be hooked too | Happy driving | 
 "words": Wanted to get up higher in traffic for visibility so went looking at crossovers and SUVs | Test drove the X5 and the X6 | NO CONTEST | The X6 has sedan like handling characteristics and had better performance | There really IS a difference between the X5's 3 | 0i and the X6's 3 | 5i | 
 "words": Wanted to get into an SUV but not one that looked like all the others | Even the X5 reminds me of a Ford Explorer | The X6 fits the bill in every way | Fun to drive great to look at and plenty of room to haul home swap meet and mall purchases | 
 "words": I waited for one year to upgrade my car X5 to X6 | We drive long distance at the weekends | We had very good time with our X5 | But driving a X6 is a Real Excitement | Our car is xDrive 35d which has 6 cylinders-turbo charged diesel engine delivering 293 HP | I drive very comfortable and feeling very secure with this car due to its safety features and control systems | we like its outer design which is different than regular cars | It also has an excellent interior design | Bottom line it was worth waiting for a year | 
 "words": It is far too expensive | Acura MDX is half the cost and although not as fast a better car | I hope I grow to like it but right now I can't help but thinking that I could have had more for so much less | 
 "words": Just picked up my 2009 X6 35i and am loving it | Lots of people don't understand why this vehicle exists but it has everything I personally look for in an everyday driver | I've got utility when I need it with plenty of cargo room for a weekend ski trip no kids yet to worry about messing up my nappa leather physics defying handling for an SUV that must be experienced to be believed a peppy engine that begs to be put in sport mode and thrashed BMW quality service maintenance great sound system cool seeing your ipod tunes integrated into the audio system the latest technology and something you won't pull up next to 5 of at the local supermarket | I can't wait to drive again in the morn | 
 "words": Of all the xDrive BMWs I've owned or even driven this one is a sublime blend of sure footed panther and raging bull | Fit and finish is above even BMW standards | It feels like it's hand made on the inside and looks like it was left behind by advanced intelligence from another galaxy | Drove both engine sizes and went with the big one 5 | 0 V-8 | The roar alone justified my decision | The slack-jaw looks it earns from the ignoratii are priceless | Forget about cargo space | This is not for soccer moms | This is for a single individual to get out and have fun quickly | Sport package is a must on this car | So is Technology package | Logic 7 premium sound is a hedge against any conversation | Get 1
 "words": Bought this car 1240 miles ago | Best handling SUV that I've driven to date | I am 6-2 and having to drive from DC to Richmond VA at least once a week for work makes sedans and other lower riding cars tiring on my legs back | Thus was looking for an SUV not for cargo space or off-roading but for the ride and seat height | With sports package it is a blast to drive especially considering its height and weight | It corners better than my '06 TL though some of it is due to the massive 20 315 tires on the X6 | Suspension is on the firmer side but supple enough once again especially for an SUV | Compared against MDX FX50 FX35 X5 ML550 narrowed down to X5 vs | X6 and picked this |
