REVIEWS
 "words": We are thrilled w the Toyota Camry Hybrid | We consistently get over 37 mpg | It's quiet and once you get accustomed to what all the dials and buttons do you just have to love it | I am very proud of the gas conservation I am able to attain | So Thank You Toyota | I've been a Toyota owner for 30 years I've always had great performance | The only problem I have is with the Engine Light | It keeps coming on and I notice the gas cap loosens up | I'm vigilant to tighten it when filling up but it still seems to loosen | I'm concerned and I appreciate seeing others are having a similar problem | I'll email my dealer today | Thanks everyone here for your info | 
 "words": This car is simply superb | I work in a vehicle-related field and I have seen crash wreck photos of Camrys people walk away from wrecks because this car sacrifices itself to save its occupants | I was searching to replace my Jetta diesel a maintenance intensive vehicle but wanted to up-size from the Prius | The Camry hybrid is for those people who hate waste and love efficiency like myself | I am a caregiver and the Camry has enough space to allow people with disabilities the room to swing in and out of the vehicle easily unlike the new Jetta TDI which has a much smaller interior | My father a solid diesel head was sold on the Camry hybrid within thirty minutes | Simply impressive | 
 "words": I needed a car with at least 30 MPG but with style and some element of fun | I made a good choice and after almost 7000 miles I'm averaging over 38 MPG | The trick to this exceptional mileage almost all highway is to use the cruise control | I am getting just over 600 miles out of each tank | Thank you Toyota | 
 "words": We purchased the car at the end of March | Most of our driving is in the Minneapolis metro area | No trips over 100 miles one way | We like the car a lot and are happy with the purchase | It's an enjoyable car to drive if you like quiet and good handling | We're averaging 38-40 mpg per tank | We too have had the Check Engine light issue concerning the gas cap | 4 times in 7400 miles | This past Wednesday night our dealership told us that Toyota will be coming out soon with a Tech Service Bulletin | The gas tank neck is faulty and has to be replaced | Ours is scheduled for next week | Supposedly with a new improved one | 
 "words": I traded my second Cadillac CTS for the Camry Hybrid | I was worried about what I considered to be a huge step down for the sake of fuel efficiency | I was wrong | It's not a race car but the Hybrid is still an exceptional ride | The Hybrid shifts flawlessly between the electric and gas engines with greater smoothness than most transmissions | To hedge my bet I had every available option included in my Camry | Wow | The fit and finish match my CTS stitch for stitch and the sound system is incredible | Best of all I am buying LESS than half the gasoline I used in the CTS | Whatever the price is at the pump I'm saving half | Buying this car is the right thing to do | 
 "words": I have had this car for 3 months | This car is reliable | The navigation is great | It has a spacious interior | I routinely get 38 MPG with this car | Trunk space is limited compared to a regular Camry due to all the batteries but I don't mind | The engine is underpowered compared to a regular Camry but this is normal for a hybrid car | If you understand the limitations of this hybrid you will be happy with it | I love the low fuel consumption and the infrequent trips to the gas station | 
 "words": In the daylight it works like an ordinary mirror but at nighttime it works like a strobe | In city driving each time you pass a lit sign it decides whether to darken or stay in daytime mode | There's a lag time in its transformation resulting in blinding light reflecting in your eyes when you pass a sign followed by the mirror darkening then going back to daytime mode just in time for the next lit sign thus blinding you again | On the highway when a car is directly behind you the mirror stays in the nighttime mode when that car changes lanes the mirror switches to daytime mode and you're blinded by the next car until it gets close enough to activate the nighttime mode | 
 "words": I have now driven this vehicle for approximately 10000 miles | I bought it with all the amenities | The leather interior is top notch | It comfortably seats 4 adults | Not being a techno geek the blue tooth was easy to set up and is crystal clear | Trunk space is small by Toyota standards but roomy by other maker standards | The ride is smooth and quiet | Gas mileage great | Sound system and GPS are fabulous | ONE ANNOYING PROBLEM the gas cap loosens itself and causes the check engine light to engage | I do not top off and carefully make sure the gas cap is tightly closed but it somehow loosens | When I tighten the cap the light will eventually turn off | Seems related to air pressure in the tank | 
 "words": I love everything about my Camry Hybrid so far the only issue has been the check engine light but that was also an issue on 2002 Camry XLE and the trunk is too small maybe can be improved in the future | 
 "words": Have had my new Camry hybrid for three weeks now and absolutely love it | I have driven a Lexus LS 400 for the past 14 years | The fit and finish is excellent on this car and I really like the hybrid system | I have ran two tanks of gas so far and have averaged 38 mpg overall in mixed city and highway driving in Atlanta | It is amazing how often you can run strictly on the battery or a mix of very little foot on the gas and battery to increase your mpg | As you pull up to every light or slow way down the engine shuts off and the car is totally quiet | A small touch to the accelerator the engine fires up seamlessly and off you go | The car is extremely comfortable | 
 "words": After much research I purchased a 2009 Sky Blue Pearl Toyota Camry Hybrid | I have put 1000 miles on it so far and love this car | The seats are comfortable and for me the rear view vision is so much better than the car I drove previously | I got 36 | 7 mpg on my first tank of gas so am very pleased | I like all the storage and cupholder placement | Love the sky blue color was tired of gray and white | A C system works so much better than my 2006 Mercedes | The Toyota is quiet | It does have a slight whine when you slow down to stop |

 "words": Just a note to say that I sold my Hummer for a Camry Hybrid 3 weeks ago and the gas mileage just keeps getting better | Although it's rated for 33 34 I've been able to get as high as 45 | 3 mpg highway without cruise control and 57 | 8 with cruise control | I do have a heavy foot and even my cruise control has a tendency to creep up around 75 mph | In the city it seems to average closer to 30 but I love it so far | 
 "words": I had a Mercedes that I loved because it hugged the road so I hesitated to trade imagine my surprise that this car does give good feedback | I feel fully engaged with the road | I love this car | I wish I had bought it sooner | I had planned buy a Prius and I liked it but I loved the Camry | I decided to sacrifice a little of the Prius's gas mileage for the Camry's moonroof and heated seats and just general overall more of a stable sedan feel |

 "words": The technology wrapped up in this car is worth far more than the sticker price | Talk about a sound vehicle | My wife and I are competing to see who can get the highest score on the MPG gauge | So far she is ahead with a 35 | 7 but it's just our first tank | Hard to find but well worth the effort | It feels like a far more expensive car | Plenty of power if needed but who cares about power when you're watching the MPG |
