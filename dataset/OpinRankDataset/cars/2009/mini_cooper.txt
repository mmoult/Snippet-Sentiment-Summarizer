REVIEWS
 "words": Wow what a fun car | I've owned lots of cars through the years but I've never owned one that could bring such a big smile to my face | The Cooper S has all the features one could ask for in a street legal slalom car | It handles extremely well is balanced in turns accelerates when called upon and is willing to squeeze through tight spots where no ordinary vehicle will venture | Combined mileage has been 31 MPG and that's good with me | I just wish the engine didn't just sip high octane | I'm 6'-2 and fit very comfortably in either front seat although I prefer the driver's side | The controls are not intuitive but they can be learned | Storage is what you should expect from a sub-compact | Tiny
 "words": I started doing research and I drove the new VW CC the Nissan Maxima and the Mercedes C300 | But I wanted something different something fun to drive small sportier and unique | My solution MINI COOPER S Dark Silver Premium and Sport Package | I drove both the base MINI and the S and they are both fine but you can really tell the difference the turbo and the extra HP makes on the S besides the few differences on the exterior which I find really cool | The MSRP is ar
 "words": As everyone else says this car is extremely fun to drive | The go kart term gets used a lot but it's absolutely true | I traded in a Mercedes E350 that was nothing but trouble and have not regretted it once | The MINI is everything I hoped for and more | You just cant help but have a fun driving experience when you are in this car | 
 "words": The salesman told me it handles like a go cart | I concur | He didn't tell me to expect better gas mileage than advertised | I get 30 mpg around town and over 40 mpg on the highway | Amazing | Very happy with this two seater the back seat is a joke which I was prepared for before I decided on this great car | 
 "words": Where do I start | This car so far has been such a pleasure to own and drive | and this is coming from a previous sport sedan owner | The WOW factor is definitely there | with impressive engine performance great fuel econ and excellent driving dynamics | Apart from the performance factor the design though polarizing to some is undeniably unique and the brand itself has a loyal and dedicated following with a large number of auto enthusiasts in the group | Finally the option to be able to customize this car to your exact specifications can be expensive yet a lot of fun | I have the S version which is a must for the performance oriented drive | Try the MINI | you will never stop smiling | 
 "words": I wanted a combination of excellent performance with great gas mileage for under 25000 | This car is by for the MOST FUN car I've ever driven and I have had my share of fun cars | The power and handling are very comparable to a BMW | The interior space is deceivingly spacious and although the rear seats are small the back seats do not deserve the overly cramped reputation that they have earned but you're not buying the car for the back seats | The turbo is more than adequate considering the car gets 34 mpg on the highway | There are a few negative aspects- the controls are not easy to use radio heating cooling system and the speedometer is in the center of the dash which is awkward | 
 "words": I have had my Mini Cooper Hardtop for about a month now and I honestly have to say without question it's THE most fun c | ar I've ever had and I have owned a Firebird and a Camaro | I learned early that I have to be careful | once I was driving down a 35 mph street and was shocked when I realized I was actually doing 89 mph | Fuel economy is remarkable and its extrior looks turns heads on the road | 
 "words": I never thought that I would be impulsive and simply buy it because I had driven one during a trip to Europe | I have a Porsche Carrera 4 in my garage and I find myself picking-up the keys to my mini more often than not | It drives like a dream It hugs the road like the best it is roomier than the expensive german brother and it gives me 35 miles per gallon on the freeway | People complain about a small trunk space They should buy an SUV | I play golf often and my clubs fit in the back with the rear sits down | If you want fun reliable transportation and great gas mileage Buy a Mini-cooper S | If you don't like it no problem you'll be able to seel it for almost as much as you paid | 
 "words": This car has a Nice go cart feel but I think there should be a little more power | The exterior design is probably the worst thing about it I don't think its bad but most of the people I ask say it looks like a clown car or some weird like that but I like it | 
 "words": I wanted safe but cute cool but with some get up and go and let me tell you I test drove a lot of cars in this price range and nothing even came close | The way it handled the looks you get when you roll up in a crowd | Great gas miliage | I got her the automatic in pepper White and she loves it | As a father I feel at ease when she is in her mini | A great car | Parents if you are looking to hook up the kid with a safe and cool looking ride just go test drive the mini and you will get one too trust me | My daughter still asks me is this mini really mine | 
 "words": I drive 65 miles round trip to work and home | The Mini S is getting 34MPG and that is a combo of city traffic and HWY | It really wants to go and I mean fast | It's the best car that I have ever owned | 
 "words": No it's not a 911 but it is surprisingly more fun | The quirky character starts with the handling and interior and goes all the way to the company propaganda love the 'always open' mantra and the crazy ads that go with it | I can pull more g's in the corners than i could with my 911 or boxster even on stock suspension tires love the incredulous look as i pass them on the curvy on-ramps | incredibly easy to manage the manual transmission heel-toe downshifts are easy rev-matching is much easier than the supercharged minis | averaging 29MPG with spirited drivingsome stopngo | 
 "words": Hi I bought 2009 mini cooper S in late November | When I first bought it I loved the way it looks and the tightness of feel it gives when you drive | I now have about 16000 miles on it and had no single problem with a car so far | One thing I am very dissatisfied is this car tends to jerk occasionally when you press the gas gently | Seriously | Also even though I've heard model S has so much power and accelerates fast I absolutely disagree | It really does not accelerate that fast from stop to 60 or accelerating while going | On the freeway I always have hard time trying to cut other cars off without using sports mode | Even with sports mode this car just does not accelerate that fast | 
 "words": This car is a birthday gift for my wife | She loves it very much | The car is very reliable nothing wrong so far | The fuel efficiency is excellent | This car is very fun to drive you will enjoy the driving | The MINI drivers are friendly they smile to each other on the road | The car is small but it runs very fast you can easily reach 70mph on highway | 
 "words": Just got my Mini yesterday after doing months of research on several compact cars | The minute I test drove the Mini I was sold | It is good looking fun to drive and just me | I am hoping it lives up to my expectations but so far | it is everything I wanted | I got the red with white top and white bonnet stripes | CUTE | 
 "words": I've never had more fun in a car than in my MINI JCW | It pulls hard from 2500-5000 RPMs corners like no other brakes instantly and looks outstanding mine's dark grey with a black roof | It's nice to be the envy of everyone on the road especially others driving a Cooper or Cooper S | In fact the sense of community with other MINI drivers is one of my favorite aspects of the car | I was fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I could afford the JCW and the slight performance increase and I mean slight it's not much and exclusivity factor made the extra money worth it | HOWEVER for anyone more sensible than I the Cooper S is plenty fun and very much less expensive
 "words": I have wanted one since I saw the Italian Job | I decided to buy one for myself for my Birthday last July | I had to wait 14 weeks for it but it has definitely been worth it | I got it with the Premium packagethe Cold Weather package Nightfire Red paint and black top bonnet stripes | Love the heated seats and mirrors during the cold northern Ohio winter and have been loving the dual sunroof this Spring Summer | I must say I was a little concerned about the upcoming Winter but the Mini was a dream to drive in the snow as well | We got hammered a few times last Winter with a foot or more of snow and the Mini handled the snow better than the Chevy and the Toyota I had owned previously | 
 "words": I have about 3000 miles on this car with thus far no defects | I bought the car because fo the retro looks handling fuel economy and relatively low price given the abundance of features | I was correct in all these suppositions but greatly underestimated how disagreeable the ride is | Even after abandoning the pathetic runflats for top rated normal performance tires the ride is jiggly under all conditions but the smoothest roads | Now those of you not bothered by this and there must be many fine | However this is by NO MEANS a discounted BMW | BMWs work magic somehow in the first 10 cm of suspension travel soaking up road inperfectis while keeping phenomenal traction | This is no BMW
 "words": Love the car hate the electrical bugaboo that has caused it to change abruptly from full on function to stone cold dead | It's up to the dealer at this point to convince me that this can be resolved | I hear they get high marks for service that's customer oriented so far they have been but the electrical issue is still there after stranding me the first time | Disappointing because we really like the car the dealership is trying but I hate the idea of always wondering about electrical issues that are supposedly resolved | We'll see | 
 "words": I saw a MINI probably 10 years ago wanted one ever since-the night before picking up my MINI concerned I might not like it as well as I hoped on the ride home 2 hours from the dealership I love it more than I could've imagined - Fall in love with it every morning all over again on my 25 mile commute There's no comparison of the pep of this 4cyl to any American made 4cyl or quality of the overall car -I've driven GM vehicles for 35 yrs before this car I think I understand why GM is having finanical difficulties sorry GM I didn't take the decision to buy foreign lightly buying US was instilled in me as a child but unfortunatly I couldn't find anything even close made by US mfg

 "words": this car is A in my books my second Mini S in 5yesrs this one is out of this world | A pleasnt experience 
 "words": Bought as daily driver | I am not tracking the car so the base model has more than enough power and did not want to deal with the cold start valve clatter or sometimes melting non- functional hood scoop of the S model | The money I saved enabled me so by some extras | 
 "words": Great car | Let me start by saying that I'm 6'4 250 and I have plenty of space | Took it on a trip from Detroit Michigan to Naples Flordia 3 months after taking delivery | Averaged 35-MPG for the trip and was comfortable for the 21 hour trip | Turned heads the entire trip and was just a blast to drive | This is my first MINI as well as my first small car and plan to keep it for a long time | Used to lease large SUV's or trucks in the past but no more | I love my MINI | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Mini | It's great fun to drive and I get noticed by people who are obviously jealous because they don't have one | I am 6' 2 tall and I have more headroom in my Mini than many vehicles I have driven | The fuel economy is great | I average 35 40 MPG around town | My Mini only has three options speed control bonnet stripes and checkerboard mirrors and it was well worth the 20000 price tag | 
 "words": A home run | why can't US car companies build something like the MINI | We paid right at 30K for the car and feel like we got a bargain | The new MINI retains some British charm but really should be regarded as the smallest member of the BMW lineup it looks and feels incredibly solid for a small convertible | My wife says she feels like she's behind the wheel of a baby tank | Our S cabrio w A T is returning 31 MPG in mixed city hwy driving to date | What a combination of power and fuel economy way to go BMW Peugeot | Way way bigger inside than it looks from the outside I'm 6'2 200 lbs and very comfortable in drivers seat | Trunk is tiny but useful w back seats folded down |

 "words": If you want a high-end car for a fraction of the price this car is for you | My 09 Cooper is loaded | The car handles better than a go Kart | It's a true sports car with a touch of class | The S makes it move quick and the manual trans | gives you the controll you beg for | You can't go wrong with these vehicles | This is my Second Mini and I just can't get over the QUALITY that is put into these vehicles | They say the S does 138 top speed | I've come closs on a couple of occations and the car handled perfect | 
 "words": This is one of the best cars I have driven | The last car I drove constantly was a Jaguar X-Type Sport and I would still pick the MINI over the Jag | Great classic look and a really fun interior | Handles like a go kart | I do wish that I could have a little more power | I also wish I had bought a sunroof |

 "words": I recommend that before you purchase a Mini you have access to top tier premium gas stations such as Chevron and QT | If you live out in the countryside as I do be aware that using other than above mentioned gas will destroy your fuel pump system | Premium quality gasoline does not mean top tier | there's a mixture in other stations that may destroy your engine | Neither the Mini Cooper website nor the Consumer's Report website made any mention at all about this extremely important concern | I was able to find a station within a 30 mile round trip from my home | Again think this out very well before you consider purchasing a Cooper | 
 "words": Drove the Civic SI MazdaSpeed3 GTI A3 and R32 before finally ordering the Cooper S | If you don't go crazy with options MINI is reasonably priced | Engine is hugely satisfying at any range while still averaging 28 mpg combined cycle and has great resale value | The options list is as huge as a 911s which costs 4 times as much | There are tons of options for after-market parts | I love the free maintanance program |

 "words": I'm hooked | Even my daughter that wanted me to get a Saturn Sky is glad to have this car | It is true what people say it really does handle like a go-cart | Super responsive and I just hit 1200 miles with a life to date MPG of 35 | 9 | Power and handling are the most obvious features of this car | I will own a MINI from now on |
