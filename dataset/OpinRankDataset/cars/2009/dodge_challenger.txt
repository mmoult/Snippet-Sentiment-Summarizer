 "words": The best car i have ever owned | as a matter of fact i owned one for a year and traded it in for the new model The classic edition
 "words": I have waited many a year for this kind of vehicle and now I have one | I still remember the hemi-cudas six-pac super bees etc | but never owned one | When I seen the new Callengers I just had to have one | And I tell you if you want a car that gives excitement this is it | 425 hourses with 420 ft lb torque is just plain sick | And the looks and the comments are never ending when I am driving the Beast around | Everytime I get in her I can't get rid of that you know what eating grin off my face | Especially after a couple Mustang GTs found out what it was like to mess with that 6 | 1 liter under the hood | Thank you Dodge for bringing back the excitement | 
 "words": a real head turner -everywhere you go people will lookstare and compliment | even the cop who stopped me because i didn't have plates yet said it was a gorgous car | styling is flawlessinterior is comfortable and roomie | everything is fairly easy to use | 
 "words": Traded an 07 C6 for this 09 6 spd SRT8 and could not be happier | The comfort level smooth ride and power when you need it is what driving a car is all about and this car has it | It certainly does get the attention from others | Dodge did this one right | 
 "words": I have owned BMW Lexus and Infiniti before buying my SRT8 | Yes I do miss the superior service department experience that comes with a luxury car | However this car is something to marvel at | I believe it is money well spent | The performance power and control is pretty impressive | I love the interior design and room provided to the driver and passenger | 
 "words": Very nice | Drives great | Definitely turns heads | My opinion the black is the best looking of them all | 
 "words": Bought the 3 | 5 l so I could enjoy the look and feel and still afford to drive it | Gets looks everywhere I go and everyone I talk to agree gas mileage is way to go | No regrets at all still has get up and go
 "words": Bought this car in late Feb 09 have put roughly 8600 miles Aug 09 on it since then and am still very pleased with my choice | For reference I replaced a 99 Malibu | Exterior is amazing still draws comments and gawking stares corners extremely well for its size | Interior is a lil uninspired strongly recommend the sunroof to avoid a cave- like feeling | Very comfortable though and plenty of room in the back seat and trunk | 0-60 seems a lil lacking but 60-80 is near instantaneous | Putting an exhaust on it soon a lil quiet for a sports car | Engine bay is large plenty of mod space | very reliable NO mechanical issues to date | Gas mileage is about 23mpg combined highway city | Love this car | 
 "words": I bought an '09 R T Challenger in February | The ignition module failed after 4500 miles | The car sat at the dealership for almost 2 weeks while they kept telling me that they could not find the parts | Finally they fixed it | When I got it back it was scratched and the interior was filthy of course this was the dealership's fault that I took to | Also on 4 occasions prior to the ignition failing the vehicle was hard to start it acted like the battery was low | The cruise control resume did not work smoothly you could hit the resume button at about 60 mph and it would jerk it's way back to 70 | Anyway I traded it for a new GT Mustang last week | Too many heartaches | 
 "words": I've never had a car I look forward to driving more than this one and I've had a lot of cars including a 1970 R T | Just a blast to drive | Very responsive for being so heavy | Great sound system | 
 "words": This is the first Dodge or Chrysler vehicle that I have ever purchased and all I can say is that I am VERY impressed | I have owned Ford and Chevy products but Dodge got theirs right | The ride is smooth yet planted but if you want to get squirrely just mash the accelerator | As for gas mileage I typically get 12mpg in city and 23mpg on the highway | But I didn't buy this car for it's gas mileage I bought it for it's retro styling and performance | A throw back to the 70 Challenger and Dodge didn't miss a beat with this car | Also the DriveSRT Experience that is included with purchase of any SRT WICKED COOL | This little perk allowed me to race all the SRT vehicles available in 09 | 
 "words": The fun to drive factor on the SRT is off of the charts | Agressive driving on the streets does not challenge this car in the least | It is quiet at highway speed | At 75 mph western States speed limit It gets better gas mileage than than most 4 cyl | cars | It doesnt brake a sweat cruising at higher speeds | How many econo boxes can average 25 mpg at over 80 mph and do it all day with no issues | America has been fooled into believing that an econo box that gets 35 mpg on the highway will do that at high speeds | NOT | Love this car | 
 "words": This car is a blast to drive | It really makes you feel like a rock star when you drive it | Everybody and I mean everybody loves the look of this car | People just stop and stare | 
 "words": I have had this car for half a year or so and I absolutely adore it | It is a very quick car that has a large aftermarket following to make the car screaming fast | The styling is by far one of the best of any cars out there right now while still being usable | I can fit myself and 3 full sized friends in the car with ease and comfort something I know isn't possible in the competition | The ride is amazing seeing as it was fitted with mercedes tuned suspension and the attention it gets is unmistakable | It's not the fastest car on the road stock but there will always be another car that is faster | The looks of this car and the feeling I get is purely unique to the Challenger | 
 "words": I previously was forced to sell my 1971 'Cuda | When I saw the Challenger SRT concept car I thought that my car was reborn | Since I have owned this car it has not disappointed me | It accelerates handles and brakes like no other car that I have owned | Its retro shape and Hemi-orange color turn heads every where I go | 
 "words": This is a great car probably the best I have ever owned | The car is quiet runs smooth gets a lot better gas mileage than I anticipated and has power to spare | The most fun is that I feel like a celebrity | I have had this black Challenger R T for about 4 months | I have met more people who just want to talk about the car | I constantly get the thumbs up | The Japanese can't design and make a car like a Challenger with this styling power and performance and at a great price | This is American automotive know-how at its best | 
 "words": The 2009 Dodge Challenger SRT8 is an absolute BEAST | I was first drawn to the Challenger by its incredible retro- styling | The broad sholders and intimidating front grill much different from any other Dodge grill pattern just made this car stand out and grab your attention | Although the car looks great what really sold me on the car was the way it drove | Once I sat behind the wheel and drove the SRT8 with the 6 speed manual transmission I was simply blown away | The car growled and rumbled with sheer power and accelerated like nothing I have ever driven before | The 6 | 1 Hemi with the 6 spd transmission convinced me that I would enjoy the Challenger for years to come | 
 "words": Saw the Concept car in late 2006 | Hadn't bought a new car since 1986 nothing worth getting excited about until I saw the Challenger | Ordered my SRT in March got it in November | It was worth the wait | 6 speed is tight limited slip 3 | 92 gearing is great | 425 HP from 370 cu in is better than the original 426 cu to hp ratio | Handles like a car half its weight | The styling is amazing | The Pacifica Studio folks did a great job | Hit the retro look nail on the head in every way | Can't go anywhere without someone wanting to chat about the car and look under the hood | Huge trunk and back seats compared to Mustang and Camaro | The car has been flawless under all conditions | AMAZING RIDE | 
 "words": Over the years I've owned three Corvettes and while I loved those cars nothing compares to the Challenger | As a 20-something driving an '07 Corvette most of the attention I was getting was negative whereas the Challenger gets nothing but positive attention | The car is plenty fast for its size and the interior is large and comfortable | At 6'6 few cars can fit me but the Challenger is very comfortable and I can actually fit three people with me something I couldn't say with a Camaro or Mustang | The shifts are a little long and the skip-shift while annoying is something I'm already used to with my Corvette's Tremec 6-Speed | Overall I love the look the character and speed of my SRT | 
 "words": Generally a great car | I have always really liked the late 1960s Dodge B body Charger and E body Challenger cars | The new Challenger distills the old E body car design without the noise handling body flex and 10 mile per gallon issues of the older muscle cars | The acceleration and handling are great IMO | I picked the 5 | 7 liter R T as the best compromise on engine power cost and gas mileage | There have been two glitches | at 3500 miles the airbag light came on for a few seconds while cruising | And at 4000 miles the alternator battery light came on and stayed on until I shut the engine off and restarted | The dealer checked all wiring and found nothing | 
 "words": Fantastic Auto | Got the 6speed manual been geting 29 | 5 mpg here in New Hampshire on the highway | the average mpg is around 25mpg | this mpg does drop when I show off or when speeds exceed 75mph car handles well even at speeds in excess of 100mph straight line that is fun to drive on twisting Vermont roads | over 9300 miles now engine and drive train great car cant say enough about it | If you want one buy it now | dont what the goverment will have you driving around in the the people's car they will all look the same performance will be some thing we will dream about remember the Yugo | 
 "words": Trading in my 2008 Caliber R T AWD for this beautiful peice of Muscle was the best thing I have ever done | This car has everything | Power comfort looks reliability and FUN | My girl is a Hemi Orange 6 speed manual with stripes | We turn heads everywhere we go | I work at a large retailer and customers actually ask who owns the car and seek me out to tell me they love it are usually surprised I'm female I've had no issues with the car during the 1st 3500 miles | I get about 17mpg in town and about 21mpg on highway trips | The trunk is huge and the extra spot where the spare tire would be is very useful to store small items like her own little vacuumout of sight with no rattling | 
 "words": I have always owned Mustangs ever since high school and boy did that change when I saw the new Challenger | I had just got a 2004 Cobra the car of my dreams or so I thought | One thing I never really cared for was that Mustangs were so small and had no room for family they also rode a little ruff after a while definitly not a dailey driver or for road trips | We went to the dealership and they had one left they wanteed 42 but I talked them down to 34 wich is good considering I live in Cali | My wife was hesitent but after we took it to Oregon to break it in she fell in love with it | As much as it weighs this thing is still fast and so smooth at the same time | Such a head turner | 
 "words": If you want a car that can blow by a mustang on the highway with ease | If you want a angry muscle car to put those lame import owners with there silly racing pipes to shame | Get this car | The only problem is the my cars' blood lust to destroy every car in it's path | haahaahaa

 "words": Bought the smaller engine to drive this car to work every day | Would not change a thing about that purchase decision | Others I have spoken with who purchased the larger engines are parking theirs at home rather than enjoying this great new throw-back design from Dodge | Sure you get to rev the big engines at the light but that will only happen when it comes out of the garage | I will take the look over muscle on this new Challenger | 
 "words": Had mine 5 months | Had some transmission issues for a while but servicing dealernot the one where I bought it was great about troubleshooting the problem till it was fixed | Not my every day drive vehicle but when I take the cover off and back it out of the garage on the weekends it's a blast | 
 "words": I had dreams of buying this car once I saw it as a concept vehicle | The picture of the car stayed posted on my refrigerator for the next 2 years | I finally took the plunge and treated my self to a virtual fountain of youth | Yes back to my muscle car days of Camaros Corvettes and Monte SS | I still have the 1970 AMX | This car is a pleasure to drive and I must say no matter where I go people look thumbs up ask questions and even ask if they can sit in it | A definite head turner and handles like dream | The 6 | 1 hemi under the hood makes this car a real animal | Did I mention it gets better gas mileage than my Durango did Great job on this baby |

 "words": I was looking to trade up from my 2003 Honda Accord to either a BMW or a Lexus when I saw one of these magical cars on the road and my jaw dropped | I decided to take a test drive expecting the car to be rough around the edges and not refined enough for my taste | Boy was I wrong | This car has everything you could ever ask for | unmatched power and the most comfortable ride I've ever experienced | It reminds me of my grandparents Caddy | super plush but this car is so stylish and soooo fast | Nobody has been able to keep up with me | The looks from people everywhere I go are priceless | Like others I've had people honk take pictures etc | Definitely get the R T in the 6 speed | Love it | 
 "words": All I can say is Wow | I LOVE this car | I'm not a car man per say although I've always had an appreciation for good-looking ones | And the first time I saw it I just knew I had to have it | Several months later I'm picking mine up on my dinner break | I like to believe that I carry myself with modesty for the most part but admittedly I do enjoy the attention she gets | Ask any Challenger owner | It's just such a beautiful car | I still turn several times to look at it as I walk away after parking it | To top it off it's a fantastic ride and the price is unbelievable for the package | Much more old-school than the Camaro |

 "words": WOW Bring back the E-Body Mopars with all we loved Plus | Add stopping turning reliability gadgets to my old 71 Cuda and you scratch the surface of what this car is | Although a little porky due to all the gadgets and safety equipment this baby still performs well | The car gets more attention than anything out there and in case someone didn't notice stomp on it and the 6 speed version roars loauder than the auto since the suitcase muffler is deleted | The car handles well and the performance gauges show some of my roadcourse results with 0 | 99 lateral acceleration | Thew car seats 5 so my family of 5 can fit for some cruises or to shows without the need of a 2nd vehicle | Car is AWESOME
