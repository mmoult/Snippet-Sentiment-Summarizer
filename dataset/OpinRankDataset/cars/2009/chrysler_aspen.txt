REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased the Aspen HEV in Feb | 2009 | I love the car as far as looks and comfort | I meet all my needs | But since I purchased the car it has been in the repair shop 5 times | for a total of 37 days down time | Part of the problem is only quailified trained mechanic's can work on the car | My dealership has one so if it is his day off we are out of luck | We have had trouble with check engine light transfer case leaking sunroof computer control module catalic conveterpaint peeling and now it has been in the shop for 12 days and I still don't have it because it needs a starter battery | The battery has been on back order since October 12 2009 | I love this car but it is a lemon
 "words": This is our second Aspen | First has the Hemi | The new engine combo is slower off the line and the Hemi doesn't really kick in until high into freeway speeds but the transition across the power band is smooth and is fast enough | The smoothness of the ride hides the rate of speed increasing | The add on specials make the car a great value and a lot of small things are thought of rear view camera etc | Great sound system | Only thing I can think to complain about if I had to is the gage that shows if the engine is in electric combo or power zone | The car is stable and corners well on mountain road downhills | The AWD helps with handling and much improved over non-AWD Aspen
 "words": I usaully trade for a new vehicle annually | I traded from the SRT 8 Jeep to the Aspen | Although it took a several weeks I can now appreciate the third row seating almost 20 MPG and the engineering improvements over Jeep | I may keep this one a little longer than usual | 
 "words": We actually wanted to buy a Tahoe Yukon or Expedition | However a comparably equipped Chrysler Aspen was about 12K less | That's a lot of money so we went with the Aspen | I've never been a Chrysler fan but I am willing to give them a shot | I think Edmunds was too hard on the Aspen in their review | So far 2100 miles we LOVE our Aspen | This is a leftover 2009 model and the dealer ship was REALLY dealing | They knocked 11K off the sticker price and gave us 3K more than we owed on our 2007 Explorer | 
 "words": My first impression was that it had a CVT transmission its shifts so smooth but NO | The transmission does not seem to give the same punch throughout a wide range my Nissans in the past were much better in that area | Interior makes you feel that you are in a nice vehicle it is also an attention getter on the exterior | For a 6400 LB SUV it accelerates fast you are king of the Trucks SUVs on the road without a Hemi | Will take most 6 Cyl Cars as well just stay away from some of the import powerful V6's like the 2009 Maxima | It is a little bouncy on major dips bumps but not overly so | The Brakes are sufficient but could stop a little better | Handling on sharp bends is average at best | 
 "words": Had a 2005 Durango and this Aspen drives more like a car when compared to it | What really sold me on the Aspen was the heavy discounts Sirius Backseat TV remote start alarm chrome wheels power liftgate and 3 rows | All other brands didn't fit my budget with those same features | 
 "words": Went from Colorado to Texas and back | Smooth Ride | Avg MPG 21 | Hwy 23 City 19 | Front Seats a bit uncomfortable for 3k mile round trip | Seat configuraton was nice | Lots of room for luggage and people | Drove through wind and rain | No Problems | Headlights were outstanding | Steering in wind was no problem with one hand | Hugs road very well | Nice acceleration | Brakes were on the money | A C worked brilliantly in 105 degree Texas heat | Middle row seating could use 2 or 3 more inches for leg room | Driving visibility was excellent | Blind spots are minimal | Rear camera was a bit blurry but sensors worked well | 
 "words": Smooth ride comfortable seating plenty of space to take the family on a twelve hour ride to our vacation destination then twelve hours home | This vehicle is worth a serious look for those considering the large SUV | The price is a pleasant surprise and comparing it to the GM and Ford equivalents we saved many thousands and got a great vehicle | The hemi has smooth fluid acceleration and alot of power | 
 "words": Editors wrong on this | One great vehicle | Vehicle smaller than a tahoe | parks easier | Has a fully usable third row seat which an adult can ride in | Have myself ridden 100s of miles in the third row and find it adequate | With seat configuration I can haul six young men and all their baseball equipment | Have an Enclave too and this rear set entry easier | My best buddy says the ride is better than his wife's BMW | Have the Hybrid and it is a treat to get 18 20 mpg in city driving 4 mpg greater than my durango which i also loved | Quiet ergonomics great better than Tahoe great electronics and sound | Admit finish could be a little better but fit usability and style tremendous | 
 "words": After looking at several van and SUV models from various manufacturers I narrowed my choices to GMC Toyota Honda and Chrysler | I wanted a Hybrid vehicle but also desired 4-wheel drive for the winter weather | The Chrysler Aspen Hybrid was the perfect choice | The driving is smooth | I average 20 mpg around town which includes some interstate driving | The vehicle is solid with all the luxury features one would desire | My model has all available options | 
 "words": There's one simple bottom line for the Aspen | VALUE | This is an excellent full size hybrid SUV and the gas mileage is good and improving with break in which you should expect | Interior and electronics are outstanding | Handling and ride are very very good and the big HEMI is there when you need to fly | which you will | With the tremendous incentives and willingness to deal right now we purchased this vehicle for a price we simply could not pass up | FAR FAR below the MSRP | With the identical two mode hybrid system as the Cadillac Escalade you could pay twice the price we did | but in this economy that simply begs the question what planet are you from | If you can find one buy it
 "words": Very good handling quiet to drive very nice interior finish | Comfortable to drive on long distance | 
 "words": Chrysler hit the mark with the 2009 Aspen | Drove the competion and always came back to this SUV | Feel good behind the wheel in all situations | 
 "words": We recently purchased a 2009 Aspen with the new 5 | 7 liter HEMI | On the way to work my average MPG came to 22 | 7 which is incredible for a vehicle of this size and 376 horsepower | Edmunds needs to update its information since the new HEMI is more efficient and has more horsepower than the 2008 | The build quality and ride is incredible | Chrysler has done an excellent job |
