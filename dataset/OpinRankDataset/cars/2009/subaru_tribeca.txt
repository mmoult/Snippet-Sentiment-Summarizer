REVIEWS
 "words": Traded in a 2007 Lincoln MKZ on my Tribeca | The Tribeca is superior to the Lincoln in every way | It is extremely roomy professional reviews notwithstanding | Build quality is superb no rattles upscale looking tons of room for passengers and cargo | I also have a 2008 Outback and I can say that Subaru has it all together | If you are worried about buying American note that my Lincoln was assembled in Mexico both my Subarus assembled in Indiana | Which is the American car | 
 "words": Having leased Lexus RX vehicles for seven years and enjoying all of them | I took advantage of the opportunity to buy a low mileage Tribeca | While it doesn't have all the features integrated bluetooth Nav express up down windows power rear hatch release keyless entry etc | it is an extraordinary vehicle that I have come to enjoy very much | Multiple trips to the North woods of Wisconsin have become my second hobby because of the Tribeca | Fit Finish features quality of workmanship power safety great 4x4 Ipod connectivity great seats and best of all | it has Japanese quality control but is assembled in Indiana | I love the car and it may be my last new car purchase | 
 "words": Overall the car is well designed interior and exterior | It is a good replacement for my big SUV but will still be able to get around in the snow and ice very well | Love it so far | 
 "words": Shopped for a new car for 3 years | We knew we were going to get a Subaru and settled on the Forester but ended up with Tribeca because of the size of the back seat can sit between two large carseats comfortably and a great deal on this model | Initially was not interested in Tribeca because of the high octane fuel requirement which apparently changed this MY | Took on its first long road trip and so far has been extremely comfortable and fun to drive | It has everything we were looking for in a long-distance vehicle | The safety features are certainly a great selling point | There aren't many options accessories that we feel are missing | Nice solid vehicle |

 "words": Overall excellent fit and finish | Very good comfort and performance | Has nice pickup great turning radius very good visibility | First Subaru previous Toyota owner | Very pleased with the quality reliability performance and appearance | 
 "words": After test driving CUVs from Audi BMW Mercedes Toyota and Ford the Subaru was a very pleasant surprise | The engine is very drivable around town and the ride experience is as luxurious as the premium brands | The Tribeca feels more like a car as opposed to the minivan roots of the Toyota Venza and the Ford Edge | Interior room for five is exceptional and rear storage area is huge | Build quality approaches the luxury brands | If you are in the market for a vehicle in this class test drive them carefully | My experience did not match up with the reviews on this site | It was almost as if the experts were driving different cars | 
 "words": After driving several SUVs my wife and I narrowed it down to the MDX Lexus 350 and the Tribeca | We chose the Tribeca Limited | The Tribeca was a good combination of sport and comfort with a reasonable price tag | 
 "words": My wife and I originally searched for a new Jeep to replace the lease we had | We did our research and looked at the Tribeca and loved the interior among many other things | We ended up buying the 5 passenger SE | It definitely has more interior room than our 06 Jeep Commander | You can't find a comparable vehicle for the price quality and reliability | The vehicle has great pick-up and drives very smooth | Save your time and go look at the Tribeca | You won't be disappointed | 
 "words": We searched for a new Jeep to replace the lease we had and because of the economy we found it was not affordable | I did my research and looked at the Tribeca and fell in love with the interior | We purchased the 5 passenger SE | Sorry but it truly has more space than our old Jeep | The crossover look had some time getting used to but it is one sweet car | This one has great pick-up and very quiet | It looks like a car from the future with its dash and design | I just leased a Honda for myself before I found this one | but I know now what my next car will be if they don't try to improve it | 
 "words": Just traded in my 06 B9 Tribeca and bought an 09 | The handling on these SUVs are great and the ride comfort is best in class | The engine has plenty of power and gets 25mpg on the highway | The second row has limo like leg room and can easily handle adults over 6ft tall | And best of all it has Symmetrical AWD which gets me through over a foot of snow with no problem | 
 "words":  After 90k on my '06 I just bought an '09 | The '06 is still in the family and my previous Legacies have made it to the high 200ks with one at 330k without major repair | I felt the ride on the '06 was hard sharp but the '09 has smoothed that | I feel it is still firm not soft like the review stated | The driver's seat position has always given me more room than I need 6'1 | Although I like the outside look I'm one of the few who felt the '06 was original and creative Alfa-Romeo comes to mind | Now it looks like a Chrysler | As for interior space if you need more room buy a box |
