REVIEWS
 "words": Having been a Mustang lover my whole life finally had the option to purchase the '09 and couldn't be more happy | The V6 isn't as quick at takeoff but its gas mileage and insurance benefits outweigh that for the financially strapped | The car is very comfortable to ride in and for a sports car feels very roomy in the cab | The handling is exceptional and moves dives and dodges quickly with a velvet touch | For the price the '09 Mustang is hard to beat its a lot of car for such a small price | 
 "words": Our criteria for a car performance braking handling and comfort without breaking the bank | Plus we need to both fit she is short and I am tallThe melted down soap designs are boring along with the performance | But our surprise and complete shock was the Mustang in California Special trim | Absolutely beautiful to look out and the build quality was equal to anything we investigated | But to our shock and surprise the car was comfortable quiet and performed beyond expectations | Not a sports car watch that live rear axle but for an everyday driver we now race for the keys in the morning | Gas mileage hurts a little but its hard not to step on the gas for an ear to ear grin
 "words": I love the look of this car | I was always a fan of them and finally purchased my first pony this year | The outside is awesome and the v6 engine is especially peppy being a 4 | 0 | It is not great on gas but I do average in the mid-20s on the highway | the interior is fairly cheezy | the glovebox is pretty small my old Dodge neon had a larger and more functional glovebox and the center console is also kind of impractical but all around it is more of a sportcar than anything else so it is nothing to really get picky over | also they used a lot more cheap plastic than i would of liked | all around i would purchase it again and love it tho
 "words": This is a very well built car indeed and gets looks everywhere I go Its sporty fast and who could ask for naything more for your money
 "words": just purchased my 2009 V6 convertible mustang | it had 9500 miles when purchased | I drove it to Pensacola Fl the next week and it drove great with good gas mileage | so far I have really enjoyed this car | the style and ride is really great | No problems at all | 
 "words": My favorite thing about owning this Mustang is just the comfort of the ride | It's easy and relaxing yet I have power too | I also love the back bench I can now take both my best friends with me instead of having to either leave someone out or have to take two cars | 
 "words": I can't believe a car that is this much fun to drive can be bought for this price | Plenty of power great exhaust note compare it to the weak sound of a 380Z comfortable GT500 seats aggressive exterior styling and with amenities like the super smooth Tremec 5 speed the light touch hydraulic clutch and the 500 watt Shaker stereo this car is a dream | No wonder Ford is not looking for Govt | bailout money like GM and Chrysler | 
 "words": Overall a great car for the price | The styling is great and I get tons of compliments | I bought the V6 model for gas and insurance reasons and am happily surprised by the power | I have the manual transmission so I get more power and it is more fun to drive | The premium edition is a must have option | I plan on giving this to my son in two years and then I will be buying the GT version | 
 "words": This is a sporty car not a sports-car meaning it is fast but not Porsche Corvette or Viper fast | I like the price the look the engine exhaust sound 6xMP3 player w 500 watts stereo navi comfy seats | Interior looks and feels cheap except for the leather seats | Seat belt is strangling me | Can't say anything about reliability yet | 
 "words": I picked up my brandnew 2009 GT with Bullit Nav option last week | Still breaking it in | It's a fun car that I use as my daily drive | It's quick but that is relative of course my weekend car is a 2005 Porsche Turbo S | Still it is capable to pass the majority of cars on the road and that's what was important to me | The interior looks and feels cheap lots of plastic except for the leather seats | Good sized trunk | Nice exhaust sound | The car feels a bit big for a 22 seater | Appealing price Internet price 3k down MSPR 3 | 5k Ford incentive | Good stereo Shaker 500 with enough bass power to make the windows rattle | Pleasant overall experience at the dealership | 
 "words": I own 2009 GT Premium 5 speed manual with the California Special package it gives it the 1969 70 look I couldn't believe the handling and stability of the drive | With the split axle option there is allot of get up and go | We have been able to maintain 25 | 8 mpg average | I am still re-learning the stick | 
 "words":  This is my first brand new mustang since my 1967 fastback | This GT is great | Diffinetly the most bang for your buck | 
 "words": I had been considering the Mustang Challenger or Camaro for a new sports car | I needed a rear seat for my child unless I could leave the wife home more often | After doing much research on all the vehicles and test-driving the challenger and Mustang | I decided on the Mustang | Tried the Challenger RT and it was ok but just didn | t do it for me | I liked the outside of the new Camaro but didn | t like the inside so much | Everything I researched also swayed me away from a first year production model on any vehicle as well | Granted the | tested | numbers show the Camaro going slightly faster than the Mustang I | m not concerned | The mustang is just great all around | No regrets at all | 
 "words": When I was up for a new car I tested every vehicle on the market | Absolutely nothing compared to the car I ended up buying | The price all the options you get with it and the color options | I got the Brilliant Silver Metallic and it just shines | I highly recommend the OEM HID headlights equipped from factory | Putting on a after market kit will not compare in the least | 
 "words": I was going to get a new 2010 Camaro but the dealers were charging 6-10k dealer markup pushing the V8 version of the car out of my price range | So I wanted an American made V8 car with horsepower and was fun to drive | Not many of those still being made by U | S | auto manufacturers | I decided on the Mustang for its looks excellent ride quality horsepower blazingly fast acceleration in the 5-speed GT version I bought and Ford had employee pricing on the car | Only thing is the interior my right knee hits the edge of the dash so in long drives it's a little discomforting | Other than that the car delivers more bang for your buck than the Camaro could ever hope to accomplish | 
 "words": This is my 7th car | I owned mainly Honda accord and Nissan Altima | I don't like American cars bu I have to say this Mustang really rocks | Better reability and low cost maintenance tha my previous Honda Accord Coupe | Best choice ever | 
 "words": Fun engine | Comfortable interior | Poor build quality several of mis-fitted mis-aligned body panels convertible top issues windows are aligned differently when compared to each other etc | Long-term reliability unknown but build quality leaves something to be desired | Price likely reflects use of cheap parts which could call into question long-term durability | In summary it's a fun modestly- priced convertible with questionable quality control and unknown long-term reliability | It just does not give the same warm fuzzy that a Honda or Lexus does in terms of solid build quality right off the dealer lot | Buy only after you have noted these cautions | 
 "words": Test drove the GT but the V-6 with upfitters package caught my eye | One ride and my wife and I fell in love with the car | Very peppy acceleration good gas mileage and nice smooth ride | Will be getting an intake and exhaust soon but actually has more than enough pickup without it and nice 30MPG on the highway | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Ford Mustang and my 4th Ford car overall | My original Mustang was a 1966 sky blue AT | It had the V8 289 and Pony Interior | I now own the new Vista Blue Pony Premium car with AT and I love it | The retro exterior styling is great and reminds me of the brand's peak in the 1960's | The V6 has great power at 210 HP equal to the V8 289ci I once owned | The interior plastics and finish are much improved from 1990's Ford cars | I love the new Shaker 500 stereo system - it rocks | So far I have 2000 miles on the car and I love it | For any Ford fan this new C5 generation is the one to own all the good looks of the older Mustang combined with a modern 5 Speed AT | 
 "words": I wasn't looking for this car because of practically reasons of having a small child and winter driving but decided to take a chance and leased one | My 4-year old likes the car and there are no issues with him and using the back seat | The ride on extremely bumpy roads may be of concern for some because of the solid rear axel but even in Michigan | Classic vehicle design stands out and the interior upgrades have improved on the prior poor looking base interior | So far the experience has been real good | I'll just have to see how the vehicle performs in the winter | 
 "words": Was looking for a sporty coupe loved the styling of the Mustang and found the interior roomy I'm 6'2 | Have owned 5 weeks and have logged 3000 miles | Performance is snappy with good acceleration and surprising handling considering the archaic suspension | Pony package has rear anti roll bar big cornering improvement over base V6 | ABS and traction control recommended | Averaging 28 MPG in mixed driving gets 33 on the hwy | Exterior is beautiful to my eye | Interior is also sharp but Ford saves money on materials lots of plastic | Leather buckets quite comfortable but could use more side bolstering | No squeaks or rattles so far | Hard to beat for the money | A lot of car for 23k |
