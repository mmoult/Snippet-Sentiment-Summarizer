REVIEWS
 "words": I have been a Lexus customer for 12 years | We shopped around and found the M35X | They pushed their technology so much at the dealership we felt it had to be as good as Lexus if not better | Boy were we wrong | Unfortunately I now have 38 months of this nightmare left | I returned an 06 Lexus GS which my phone the Palm Pre had no trouble pairing with the Bluetooth | My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones | Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation | Then there is the nav what a waste of money | No points of interest | Been lost a lot lately | 53000 really Infiniti | Entire system was replaced by dealer no luck | 
 "words": I just traded a 2006 M45 which I loved for this car | I got the M35 to save a few bucks and get better gas mileage | The M35 with the 7 speed is almost as quick as the M45 | The car rides great and is fun to drive I got the Tech and Advanced Tech with Sport Packages | Love the DVD player new 7 speed transmission with sport mode hard disk music box IPOD hook up navigation and touch screen | All but the DVD and navigation are new features my 2006 did not have | I got the Blue Slate with black interior and it looks great | 
 "words": This is my second M35S as I also had a 2006 | The ride in the 2009 is a little stiffer but still comfortable for a car with 19 performance tires | The increase in power along with the 7 speed transmission makes for a great combination | The gas mileage is about the same as the 2006 at about 20mpg in mixed driving | Looked at Jaguar FX Lexus GS Acura TL and Audi A5 | None could come close to the lease deal | Best value in its class | 
 "words": How much do you have to pay these days for a car that does not rattle | In the first few thousand miles I have return this car for 3 rattles | Rattles in the dash and doors are making this car a major regret | 
 "words": I really love the 2009 M35-S | My previous car was a 2007 M35 Sport as well | The car handles extremely well can excel quickly from a dead stop and is very sporty inside and out | Even when taking the car in for service at the dealership they tend to give M owners a little extra attention and they go out of their way to make you feel special | All in all I'd recommend the M35 S to anyone | 
 "words": I am very happy with this car | Solid ride quiet nice interior | Visually distinct lines on the car | Very responsive steering | Transmission shifts are smooth and close together | Coming off a 2004 Audi A6 the build and ride quality of the M seems much better | Averaging 19 mpg in mixed driving | 
 "words": I was looking to buy the new Lexus GS and then test drove the Infiniti m35S and was sold on it | I bought the car the next day | I love my first Infiniti | It has enough power to get me in trouble and is sexy on the inside and out | The interior is beautiful and I love the heated cooled seats | Most car for the money on the road | Also the Infiniti dealership was the best car-buying experience I've ever had | 
 "words": 6 visit to the shop without success fixing 4 rattles and 4 trips to the shop regarding NAV failure | Must use my I-phone for dependable navigation | Will NOT buy another Infiniti product | 
 "words": The M35 is a dream machine | I got it with the Tech and Advanced Tech packages and the vehicle has exceeded my expectations | Driving is no longer about going from point A to B | Driving is the destination | The M35 is so much fun to drive and there is so much you can do while you are driving that it is a vehicle designed for efficiency | Lane Guidance works great the review camera with a grid makes backing up a pleasure | Recently I slammed on the brakes at the last minute and the brake assist and seat belt tensioner kicked right in making me feel safe and secure | The power of the vehicle also makes it safe it is possible to leap out of the way of a potential collision | Great great car | 
 "words": Took delivery of my new M35x 3 weeks ago | Just came out of a Lexus GS300 AWD | Although the Lexus was a little more cushy and had one or two more conveniences this car is really the only other luxury vehicle that comes close in features quality and value retention | The M definitely rides much better feels glued to the road | Also has better electronics such as the navigation system which is easier to use and the sound system with the hard drive which records your CDs very cool | I got the tech pkg so I got the upgraded Bose system but not the 5 | 1 system that comes with advanced tech pkg | Even though it is not their best it still is far superior to the Lexus' Mark Levinson system | 
 "words": This car we found is one of the best investments for your money | Tons of options spectacular entrance levels the basic car is still outstandingly nice and the appearance of the M35 all contribute to the brilliant design of this sedan |
