REVIEWS
 "words": This is the second Galant I have owned previously had 2003 with 95000 miles and that was a great car | Have had this 2009 ES for one month and have put 2000 miles on it so far | Not a problem not a strange noise nothing | Very nice car | Great styling | Nice to have something a little different than everyone else has | Nice ride love that ABS is standard | Comfortable seats | Very roomy | Very pleased so far | 
 "words": I bought this car new one month ago and enjoy the ride to work everyday city driving | My 6'3 tall but lean body build fits into the drivers seat with just enough headroom | The ride is a tad noisy from the engine particularly with the high rpm's upon acceleration but not so much to be bothersome | I don't care about the plastic interior comments from some of the reviewers | I care more about the small side-view mirrors and wonder why nobody has mentioned this | Also the turning radius leaves a lot to be desired | Why can't I turn into tight parking spots | The trunk is roomy | The rear passenger space is roomy for a small car | The good crash test performance gives you confidence | 
 "words": This is my first Mitsu | I | ve been driving it for about 2 months now in summer weather on both city and highway | I | m combining about 25 MPG on 91 octane gas which I think is great due to the elements | The car feels sturdy and 2 | 4 MIVEC engine picks up well on sportronic mode | It has a roomy interior and comfortable front and back seats | The controls are well laid out for easy access on the go | It comes with high performance all season tires which comes handy on the east coast changing seasons | This car is great buy | Everything sums up to a comfortable reliable spacious sporty fun vehicle to drive | I would recommended this vehicle to a small to mid size family looking for a 4 door sedan | 
 "words": Mitsubishi did a good job on the rear end of the 09 but hardly did anything to the front | The Sports Edition that I have does have the chrome top to the grill and darkened headlights but that's it | Its ok on gas and ok on comfort | On a recent trip my backside really got sore so I assume the seats could have been made better | I do not like the waffle like dash I can already see where dust settles on it | When in idle you can't turn the headlights off like when you're waiting for someone | To me that's irritating | There is not an accessory adapter in the console like the prior years did | Engine is very noisy compared to my 08 Camry and the doors sound tinny compared to the Camry | 
 "words": This is a fantastic car | I can't complain about anything at all | I've never liked a car as much as I like this one | it's fierce | 
 "words": I just picked mine up today | After you factor price 10 yr 100000 mile warranty then Toyota Nissan and Honda just don't make sense | So far I've enjoyed driving it around | It's comfy and the 4 cylinder feels as good as any on the market | If you are in the market for a comfortable modestly priced long term family vehicle not another run of the mil Camry like the neighbors then buy this car | 
 "words": This is our first Mitsubishi | It was a nice car at a great price at 0 financing | So far we are really enjoying it | 
 "words": Nice little sport tuned 4 door sedan | Quick and responsive engine | It possesses sporty exterior and interior look | Very real on the streets | Excellent car for your money and one of the best warranties for a sports car | 
 "words": The car drives like a dream | I cant think of anything that I don't like about this car very sporty looking starting with the grill to the tail lights they look like the Lexus tail lights | As far as the engine lots more power than the previous 4cyl plenty of power | I can't think of anything out there that can compare | Overall a very nice car for your money | 
 "words": The Galant Ralliart '09 is a very powerful and beautiful car | I love it | High points are acceleration cruising power sport leather seats aluminum pedals 20 alum | alloy wheels stereo system GPS system with many additional and helpful applications | Low points include cheap plastic interior VERY tight suspension system giving a bumpy and noisy ride adjustable seat limitation set too high rattling seat belt mechanism over-sized tail lights and the GPS DVD player in the trunk is set in a very poor location | However the Pros far outweigh the Cons | As an all-around sport edition of a mid-size car I'm very pleased with it but hopefully the 2010 will address the low points | 
 "words": Before I test drive my Galant I had preconceived notions about the Mitsubishi brand | I'd always heard that they were unreliable underpowered and boring | But once I put my foot on the gas all of that flew out the window | The 2 | 4L has plenty of power and has more pickup than my previous car a 1999 Saab 9-3 turbo even though it has less horsepower | The Galant rides perfectly on the highway with some wind noise that some of my other cars didn't have | But it handles better than I could have expected | Braking accelerating and cruising are all top notch | 
 "words": After 3 used cars the 09 Galant became my first new one and I love it | I came out of a 98 Galant and what a difference | I've racked up over 12000 miles in 5 months so I have a good feel for all aspects of the car's performance | I could nitpick and agree about the lower quality plastic interior and stuff but that's not what I rely on to get me around town | The interior is driver friendly spacious and comfortable in any type climate | It pulls well going up mountains downshifts nicely in bad weather and has smooth acceleration | I would wish for a few more horses on those short on ramps but otherwise it has plenty of get up and go | 
 "words": I bought this car w 16mi | on the odo | And put just under 2k to so far | I really like the front grille and tail lights for 09 | I'm about 6'1 and it fits me perfectly | I had a 02 Eclipse and 00 Linc Continental | This Galant is perfectly wedged between those cars in terms of performance ride quality features gas mileage and size | The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system decent pep when passing hwys great safety features | 
 "words": The whole experience of the 2009 V6 sport is extraordinary | Extremely smooth ride and when take off power is needed it is definitely there | Very classy and luxurious look with its leather interior and sun moon roof | Definitely puts my old 2007 to shame | Look out US and Euro competitors | you have a big problem on your hands | 
 "words": I just returned a Mitsubishi Galant ES '07 and was looking for a new car in or about the same price range | There really was no contest Mitsubishi wins again | I purchased the 2009 Galant Sports edition 4 cylinder model | I am a big guy and have plenty of room anywhere in the car | The trunk space is huge | There are plenty of comfort features heated leather seats tire pressure | This model drives like a 6 cylinder and feels very sporty and has a comfortable sedan feel at the same time | The Galant is very reliable | For the money I feel this is a winner all the way | 
 "words": I looked at the Camry because of styling but after driving it I could feel the car felt more like a GM than a Toyota | I then looked at the new Accord and was overall impressed with the car except for the comfort of the vehicle and ease of access to the controls | I even looked at Nissan which I said I'd never do again | The plastic interior still needs major improvement | Finally I figured I would look at the Mitsubishi Galant | The sport edition pulled me right in and for a 4 cylinder it has PLENTY pep | The handling is great and the car is extremely comfortable | Even the interior is top notch | I love my Galant | Toyota just lost another loyal customer and Mitsubishi gained a new one | 
 "words": My wife and I are repeat offenders | Just traded in our 04' for this new 09 | Its a great buy new body style sporty shifter | The engine is more quiet | 
 "words": Overall the outer styling is top notch | The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement | The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere | The plastic scratches very very easily | My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50000 | It has only one 12 V adapter | Cup holders are way to far back seat heater buttons are in a horrible location | The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor | This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in | By no means is this car fast from the stop if you want that get that Raliart model | I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off warranty items | The gas mileage is not that great in town | 
 "words": Having driven many different rental vehicles in the past two years I had a good idea of what I wanted and didn't want in the vehicle I was buying | The 2009 Sports Galant from Mitsubishi motors is a great sedan with a moderate price | It reminds me of the Hyundai Azera but it costs several thousand dollars less | The 4 cylinder has good get up and go and it accelerates quickly | The car handles well and the ride is very smooth | The car has a big trunk with the option of gaining more length by accessing the back seat interior | The car is the new canyon beige color and the exterior and interior is stylish | I am very satisfied with the car and would have paid even more for it if I had to
 "words": We owned a Mitsubishi Diamante VRX 03 model and were looking to replace it after 5 years of trouble free driving and found out the Diamante was discontinued | The other car makes were all test driven and some stood out more than others like the Passat and Maxima sedans and then my wife and I drove the 09 Gallant Ralliart | Well it rekindled our love for Mitsubishi with the build quality in the car plus the wonderful 258 horsepower 3 | 8 MIVEC engine and sport shift automatic transmission | All we can say is we recieved more for our money and fun for our dollar | 
 "words": Although Mitsubishi only made slight changes to the 2009 Galant they seemed to pick the best features to improve | The ride is smoother and quieter | The new sport fabric seat is very comfortable and they even have power and 2-part heated fabric seats | They did away with the cheap plastic console and it look very tastefully elegant | A overall |
