 "words": 3rd Corvette I had a 2002 an electronics nightmare | 2006 fast not a lot of built quality 2009 what a great car quiet as any car faster then most great gas mileage The base Corvette is the best value on the sports car market Nothing makes me happier than racing a Porsche costing 2x as much and getting 20 miles to the gallon | I drive in the snow rain and have never been stuck in this car |
