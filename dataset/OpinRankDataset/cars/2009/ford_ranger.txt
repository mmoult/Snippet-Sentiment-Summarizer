REVIEWS
 "words": Bought this little truck just for business | More than satisfied | Toughprimitivesimple40mpg and cheap to purchase | You tough guys want a truck or a symbol | I will work this thing 100 more than any Ramgarbage | 
 "words": This is my third Ranger and I was torn between this and the Toyota Tacoma | Bottom line for 6k less I got a truck that was just as capable | Perfect for hauling dirtbikes and associated gear to the track | My only complaint is the fuel economy | If you are going to buy one of these make sure you buy the 4 dr supercab | 
 "words": Good truck with good gas mileage | Small enough to do a daily commute in city traffic and easy to park in small spaces | Would recommend the FX4 with the payload package | There are a few squeaks and rattles in the cabin over hard bumps but that can be easily fixed | Runs great in 4x4 mode especially with 4 | 10 rear | The only real downside is the Goodyear RT S tires | They ride good on road but do not grip well on wet roads and not too great in the snow | BF Goodrich A T tires would make the truck feel more capable in rain snow | The leather seats are very comfortable and supportive over long rides | I highly recommend this truck | It's not as fancy but it is just as capable for the price | 
 "words": Bought a used xl longbed2 | 3with 5spd | manual | As a 60 yr | old man 6'tall 250 lbs | I find this vehicle a solid buy and a solid performer | It's no frills but peppy frugal and very tight | The design may be old but it's sure as hell not dated | A great value | 
 "words": Truck is built cheaper than my 2000 Ranger | Rattles and sqeaks from day one | Shakes and runs so rough that it causes the body and seat to shake | This goes on while driving at all speeds | Dealership says this is in 'normal' range | Gas mileage is about 19 1 2 | Far from the 21-26 | Radio poor quality also | Cannot pick up stations that can on 2000 Rangers radio | Very unhappy and sorry to have purchased | Would not advise to buy | 
 "words": I bought a 2009 Ranger XLT supercab automatic w the 2 | 3 liter 4 cylinder w AC power windows CD | After reading all the average to poor reviews on the ranger I only intended this vehicle as a low cost commuter and multi-purpose vehicle | It is actually quite good | Excellent price at less than 15K acceptable acceleration terrific fuel economy for a truck at 24 mpg average for 60 40 highway city and good build quality which Ford is now known for | I am very impressed | I drive a Mercedes Benz C350 as my other car | 
 "words": 1st tank of fuel mpg disappointment 16 | 5mpg | But doing research learned that as engine loosen with more mileage it would get better and it did with the 5sp | automatic I'm now averaging 30mpg after putting on 4500 miles | Got 535miles out of last tank fill | Truck has a tight feel when driven would be a perfect ten if it did'nt wonder when encountering road bumps | Needed attention by Ford | Otherwise great lil' truck | If you are over 6ft | like myself get the extended cap trust me | 
 "words": First off it is an automactic I could not find a choice for auto when filling out the Edmonds form | My last truck was also a RangerXLT it was a 1996 | I still have it having done courier work in it since it was new it now has 632457 miles | all oringal except routine maintance tires etc | The normal wear and tear stuff | The drivers seat has lost most of its cush but not bad considering the hours sitting in it | Im just amazed how good its been and still is | Now for the 2009 it seems to be built good and tight and my reason for getting it was solely for the reliabilty record these trucks have | Our luxury vehicle is a 2006 Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab | Back to the new 2009 I could'nt have 
 "words":  Cannot understand why reports run this truck down | It is a well made and inexpensive truck to run | You don't buy these trucks for heavy loads | Looked into a Toyato Tacoma and felt it was a rip off | Standard cap in stick shift only which forces the comsumer to buy bigger and about 4000 in price | Have owned 3 Fords since 1980 and have had dependable service | 
 "words": I've put 4000 miles on my 4cyl | maunal | Am getting 28mpg pretty consistently | It does bounce a lot but has excellent handling and surprisingly good acceleration at least when empty | I can easily park in really tight spaces and it's easier to get into the garage than my Aztec was | Front seat is very comfortable with easy access even for my handicapped sister | Not a good choice if you routinely have more than one passenger even with the jump seat | If you really want need a small truck for light loads that gets good mileage and can take a lot of abuse this can't be beat | The only truly small truck remaining | Ford should market it as such it would have a niche of its own these days | 
 "words": I bought a Ford truck my third one because all the other brands of vehicles I have owned let me down when I needed them to be reliable | The previous 2 Ford trucks 1970 F100 1993 Ranger were pretty spartan trucks | The 2009 Ranger is much more comfortable and fun to drive | The only fault I have found is the 4 | 0L 6 cyl | is not too fuel efficient | 
 "words": Love the new front fascia design | I chose the 4 cyl supercab with a few options | Other than the vibration felt in the strg whl door panels and seat I love this truck | I drove the Toyota and it is just ugly as well as 4000 more with less options | GM products are not worth considering | 
 "words": The Ranger feels well built with no squeaks rattles | The super cab 2- door space behind the seats is adequate for gear | I passed on the jump seats since I know of no one that small | The engine has decent power but the fuel economy is abyssmal at around 15 MPG or so | Glad I don't have to drive much | The ride is a bit bouncy but well cushioned I have the optional larger tires | The truck tends to wander a bit at highway speeds and requires the driver's attention on bumpy turns | All considered I like this truck much better than my previous Chev Colorado similarly equipped | 
 "words": I had a '93 Ranger before this one and been super pleased with it | I haven't had a Ranger for 12 years it was time to have one again since we brought the house | The newer Ranger has more leg room than my '93 I used to have and this time I got the basic XL package since we have a nice car for our long road trip | Where my old '93 was the XLT full package and I was single at the time | I am some disapointed with the louder cab noise than my old '93 XLT but it's not the end of the world | Over all MPG I'm pleased with the MPG I gotten on it | On my first tank I got 24mpg I am near the ned of my second tank of gas and I am around 28mpg as of now | 
 "words": Just bought the 2009 Ranger with 2 | 3 I- 4 and 5 speed automatic | This is my 2nd Ranger the other is a 1996 never had a problem with it so I bought a new one | The 2009 rides a little rougher accelerates faster and is more comfortable inside | 
 "words": Was looking for a small truck to haul lawn products and purchase too big to take home in car | I needed pretty good mileage because I am driving it to work | Well this is really the only compact now available and the current pricing is great | I was able to buy a new vehicle for about the price of a used one with 30k or so miles | The truck drives really great | The 2 | 3 inline 4 has plenty of power for both in town and interstate driving | The truck is really tight and has every feature that I can imagine that I would want | I would highly recommend if it meets your requirements | 
 "words": All around a very decent compact truck | Off road traction is very good perfect for work around a small farm | Much less road noise then i expected | Gas mileage doesnt seem to add up to EPA but still very good for a truck | The biggest problem for me is the lack of leg room makes it uncomfortable for long ride | 
 "words": I haven't had this truck for very long but I am impressed with it so far | It rides smoothly has good fuel economy and is very fun to drive | It has a lot of power for its size | Its handling is tight and is easy to move in tight spaces | Over all it's a dependable little workhorse | 
 "words":  2009 is the first year for the Sport in a 4CYL | I never would have driven one exceot my employer bought a fleet and the mechanics told me to test drive tone | I was surprised with the 4cyl guts | My gas mileage is 20 | 5 around town and one one trip it was 23mpg | Didn't look at any other models because I am stuck on the dependabilty of Fords | Great truck for the money | 
 "words": I bought this truck in 2009 and so far have put 1000 miles on it | So far so good haven't had a problem with it yet | I'm not sure about fuel economy though I have the 4 | 0L V6 and I get 14 in the city | I'm suposed to get 17 in the city and 20 on the highway | Other than that i love this truck | Its the best one That you can buy for the money | I wouldn't reccommend this truck unless there is only two people in your family | 
 "words": Have put 600 miles on the truck after purchasing new | So far very satisfied with purchase | Put to work on day 1 but only light duty hauling | Build quality road manners handling and road noise all better than one might expect for this basic truck | Fuel efficiency has been on target to EPA estimates with mostly normal driving | I rated performance very high but not based on unladen driving | Power is not excellent but instead basically as good as expected | However power under load is excellent with 1 2 ton of lumber and other materials driving manners handling clutch performance braking did not significantly decrease and power was great | Will update once I've put more miles on it
