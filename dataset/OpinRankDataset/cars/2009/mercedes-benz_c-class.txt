REVIEWS
 "words": Drove the CTS-V before the C63 AMG | Got such a great deal never bothered to drive the M3 | CTS-V was a boat compared to the C63 | Such great responsiveness and a feeling of complete control with the AMG | A friend of mine put it perfectly This car feels like you are driving a go cart | Hard to pass somebody without getting close to 100 | So much faster than my Lexus GS 430 | Can't wait to fire it up to hear the great exhaust sound | Sounds more like a lamborghini | Also like the fact that it is a sports car with four doors so can put the kids or cargo in the back | Would definitely buy this car again without hesitation | Simply AWESOME | 
 "words": This is my 3rd C class Mercedes following a 2001 C240 and a 2005 C230 Kompressor and is easily the best of the lot | It is faster than any of my previous ones more luxurious and far better built | The only area where it fails to live up at least to my 2005 is in its aggression-factor | The 2005 C230 Sport was simply a far more aggressive car with much stiffer springs deeper and firmer bolstering on the seats and a loud and sporty exhaust | Of course the new car is far more luxurious and still adequately sporty | 
 "words": Traded my 08 C6 Z06for a 09 C63 AMG | This car looks great handles wellis fast and the engine sounds terrific | Gas mileage is simply pathetic the worst car I ever had in gas mileage I am only guessing a Hummer or a Ford Excursion are worst on gas | You must get the P2 package definitely you wouldn't need the performance package | The seats are the best I ever seen better than my Evo IX Recaros | Be aware that the maintenance can be expensive but overall you are getting a top notch quality car | Insurance is OKnot too bad | Again whenever you plan buying this car makes sure you put aside a good solid 300 for monthly gas expenses | Red and black colors don't have 720 penalty | Good luck | 
 "words": This is a nice car | It looks good and handles great | Good power and a smooth transmission | The interior of this car is laid out well but it is too small | Disappointed in the size and space in the rear seats | Trunk is too small as well | I wish I would have purchased the Audi A5 or A6 maybe a BMW 330 for a little more interior room and about the same price | 
 "words": I traded in my Audi S8 for this car | My wife thought I was crazy until she drove it | It handles like it is on rails and the performance is very good overall | Not quite the acceleration of the Audi but I am getting 31 mpg on the highway between 65-70mph with the cruise set | I can't wait for the Borla exhaust to come | 
 "words": This is my first car and it is stunning | The power is great the ride and handling is awesome | The build quality so far is superior we will see how that holds up in a year or so | The dealer gave us an excellent bargin and the service was spectacular | The transmission is so smooth | The interior is great nice restrained use of over the top materials it is a very nice balance of luxury and sport but | for my taste could be a little more luxurious | fuel economy is good | just filled it up and took a road trip averaged 31 | 2 MGP | worst was 21 | 3 mpg and average with mostly city driving and occasional highway driving i get between 24-25 mpg overall and very well done and highly recommend it | 
 "words": This is a followup as we just completed an 1200 mile roadtrip with 2 adults 2 large dogs and lots of stuff | Car exceeded our expectations | all across the board and we have owned new E class 5 Series Jag XJ prior | 
 "words": This is my 3rd MB | I have the sport package Auto with the multimedia option | Amazing sound system and overall a very fun car to drive | By far has been my favorite car I've ever owned | For the money the C class provides everything I could imagine | The car feels and looks much more expensive than it is | In my opinion the body style is more appealing than any 60K dollar car I've seen on the road | It's eye catching I get tons of compliments and is a true joy to drive to work and back everyday | I'm amazed at some of the other reviews I've read bashing this car | I can't find one thing I hate about this car | 
 "words": I was originally reluctant to purchase a MB due to what I had heard regarding quality issues in the past | I must say that so far this car has been perfect no issues whatsoever great build quality with no rattles or squeaks | I did have to replace the OEM tires after 4200 miles due to wear but other then that the car has performed better then I expected | The car is FAST but also drives well on the highway for normal cruising | The electronic package is top notch as well | The HK stereo is great sounding the navigation is clear to understand and the voice recognition is far better then what my Acura has | Overall I would buy this car again with no hesitation | 
 "words": I just turned in my 2007 Acura TL | I loved that car it had great styling performance and gas mileage in the last two regards it still beats my new Benz | But as far as refinement is concerned it's not even close the MB blows away the Acura | I test-drove a TSX and couldn't believe how much cheaper it felt than the Benz despite the difference in price my best Benz lease deal is only 14 more per month than my best TSX offer |

 "words": I traded in my 2007 Lexus IS350 as I was getting bored with the car lol | I love the IS350 but wanted a change | I like the more aggressive look of the C350 as compared to my Lexus and that was the main draw as I knew I'd be giving up a bit in terms of comfort Lexus has much softer leather and seats and somewhat smoother ride and horsepower IS350 306hp v | C350 268hp | The C350 offers a more engaging driving experience falls between the IS350 and 3-Series | My Lexus was overly smooth which took the sport out of sport sedan | Despite 38hp less in the C350 it's more fun to drive than the Lexus and acceleration is more than adequate to get ahead of traffic | 
 "words": This is a terrific car which is priced right | It has beautiful outside styling and inside looks like a high- end luxury sedan | Roomy and comfortable front seats | The car is a lot of fun to drive with responsive handling and a quiet ride | Will use any excuse to drive even running errands | I have it with Premium Package and Ipod which works well | Recommend the multimedia package in hindsight though I did not get it | Anyone looking for a sporty luxury sedan at a fair price should consider this car | 
 "words": After the first 1000 miles the car is amazing | Gas Mileage has been good not great but better then average from other posts i have read | Though hp could be more that is not the mind set i had for this purchase if i was only concerned with hp the bmw or infinity would do I wanted smooth ride luxury feeling solid build construction and of course an amazing looking body style inside and out | 
 "words": Let me just say I'm not easy to please ask my spouse BUT this car is a DREAM | I had a MB in 2002 all kinds of problems swore them off | After 2 disappointing BMWs and 9 months of car shopping decided to drive into MB dealership and check out what was new | Fell in LOVE with the C class but wanted more power | The salesman suggested C 63 | Once I drove it that was the end it was mine | Loving the 450 hp and the kick when you gun the engine to get around a slow poker | I wake at 5 am just to go out in my garage and have a look | AWESOME car I couldn't be happier | 
 "words": After comparing similar entry-level luxury sedans the car was competitive in every category | My buying decision came down to styling | Despite the Edmunds editors review i found the styling lines and the aggressively designed and low front end as final decision maker | 
 "words": Much improved in every way over my '04 C-240AWD | Beautifully and solidly put together like any M-B should | Smooth power but no hot rod Though not striking stylish and functional interior | Sport model has nice balance between ride comfort and sporty handling | The C-Class is not dazzling in any one area but the sum of the parts equals one fine substantial all around car | 
 "words": Last Mercedes was a 1986e | Awful | Switched to Saabs and then two Bmw 5's and finally a Bmw 330x | Cabin too small on the Bmw 3 and the run flat tires are awful | The C300 Sport 4 matic don't laugh performs like the 5 series only more nimble | Plenty of power and stability | Interior is a little austere and the trunk is just too small | Close call over the Audi 4 but on balance a more solid feel without those silly led headlights | 
 "words": This is my second review after 10 months and 10800 miles | Please see the very first review in the series | I am overall very happy with the car | The ride is solid well controlled and the steering is light which I personally like | Surprised to read others' horror stories about gas consumption as I get 17-18 mpg in the city and 28-30 on the highway at 65 mpg | The manual shifter is not the slickest on the market Acura TSX is better I tried but pretty short throw and works without failure | The car isn't super fast from the start but enough power for me after all it's 228 hp not 300 like some others | Like how quiet the car is | The electronics are great got P2 package | 
 "words": I don't think you are going to believe what my wife and I just experienced this afternoon Just bought a brand-new C300 from Smythe Europeans about 5 hours ago | Very nice short experience with the sales manager Nice guy very good deal | We got home noticed that a bigger chunk of rubber was sticking out in the corner of the driver's door | Also inside a little piece of carpet between passenger's seat and the middle was missing | We drove back Sorry can't do anything you need to come back on Monday | 2nd time coming home the long rubber piece below the driver's door CAME OFF literally | Can you believe it | Nice design but my wife can't even enjoy the first day with her new car now | 
 "words": Bought this car as a present for my wife just because she wanted it | This car is pathetic in comparison to my BMW | Even the Corolla I owned previously was better | Engine computer module keeps on failing | Even the loaner they gave me felt flimsy as if it was about to fall apart |

 "words": It's a performance car only for people who have never owned a performance car | Everything is an option and you feel like you're getting nickled and dimed | Mercedes quality has been below average for a long time hence no purchase but maybe now it's getting better | Got this car at a good price so I bought it | Hope I don't regret it | 
 "words": We just purchased recently but so far are really impressed with the car | The style is a head turner and the interior is awesome | the high tech | advancements are very high end | It drives like a little sports race car while has much more room inside than expected especially with the fold down rear seats | Huge advancements over prior models and it really feels and looks like a MB should | 
 "words": I love this car it has it all Comfort Looks and Performance | Great Gas Mileage | No complaints | 
 "words": I've owned many M-B's since 1984 | This is a very nice car but after a month I wish I'd gotten the C350 | I also have an '06 Porsche Carerra S Cab and just turned in an '07 E350 | It has P1P2Nav18's and Panoramic Roof | All that stuff works great but the seats are not as comfortable as my E350 was | My two major gripes are the brakes and power | I do 70 freeway driving and at 65 mph this motor has limited passing ability | Punch it and it makes a lot of noise but takes an hour to get around a big rig especially on an uphill grade | I guess it depends on what you're used to | Additionally the car is 'underbraked' | You really feel the brakes straining to bring the car down when needed | 
 "words": This is my first Mercedes and I absolutely love it | I bought a 2008 model with package 2 and enjoy every day of driving it | Very beautiful people always look at it | Good gas mileage excellent handling very smooth and quiet ride excellent breaking stops immediately with hardly any noticeable impact | Excellent suspension offers comfort or sport ride options | Powerful V6 engine traction control and 4matic all wheel drive helps to handle the car very well on the slippery roads and snow | Has lots of neat features inside and out | 
 "words": i LOVE this car | It has everything i could want and more | Wanted the new C since it came out and finally got it and couldn't be happier | Drive one and find out for yourself | Plenty of power for me | I just hope the reliability is as good as it seems when new | Ride is excellent in typical German manner | 
 "words": I have P1 iPod 4Matic and Multimedia in addition to a regular not panoramic sunroof | I was shocked to realize that the rear seat did not fold | I also wish that MB would be more standard in premium packaging | For example the M-Class's premium 1 package includes parkview camera and navigation | 
 "words": Beautiful car | The only complaint I have is I wish it had more horsepower | I have a G35 coupe which has 280HP and going down to 228HP is a little change | The ride is awesome | 
 "words": I test drove Audi A4 and Lexus I250 | Both are great cars but they did not catch my soul | As soon as I saw C300 Sport in the deader I fell in love | Excellent exterior design | The ride in C300 is very comfortable and solid | When I drive it in the hard rain it is unbelievably stable | I feel more secured and protected inside C300 while driving than IS250 and A4 | The gas pedal is stiff but once I step on the car runs fast | Gas mileage is about 20-21 in local traffic and 25-26 in highway | Not so bad in V6 | The package includes Premimum 2 Ipod connection automatic transmission | 
 "words": The C350 shows sporty yet classic MB styling is well crafted has excellent power and torque and is incredibly fun to drive | The navigation and upgraded sound systems are well worth buying especially for gadget toy fanatics | Voice command control is a fantastic addition to this car | Handling acceleration are well-balanced with a smooth quiet ride | The sport tires are slightly louder than touring tires but it's well worth the price of driving a sport-tuned suspension | Overall the car compares very favorably with BMW 335i but likely cost close to 5000 less than comparably equipped models |

 "words": This is car is amazing | It has great pick up amazing sound system and great standard features | It's fun to drive and gets many looks | I have had it for almost two months and it keeps getting better with time | I find myself making excuses so I can go drive the car | Well worth the price | 
 "words": Was on the fence between the M3 E63 '09 CTS-V and the C63 | Boy did I make the right choice | This car is absolutely amazing | I hit 160 and the car felt like it was just getting started | Only complaint is the tires already had to replace at 7k miles but that was more a function of driver hee hee | Anyway this sedan is the real deal | My wife who I had to convince to let me buy even loves to take it out for the occassional Sunday stroll | 
 "words": This car drives like it should cost twice of what it did | For the money you can't beat it | Very disappointed with the paint bugs left marks on the front spoiler and hood wash twice a week and it still took the paint off | Love the car but wouldn't buy another one because of the cheap paint | 
 "words": I was all set to buy a BMW 3 series as it comes with a free maintainence package but my cousin who has a new C class took me for a test drive and the result I bought one | whatever you talk it's the best by far an large | I drove to DC from NY and back the same day looking and feeling as fresh | This is the best car you can ever own for the price | People talk of performance of 3 series BMW well I also used to | But what's the meaning of performance if other aspects are compromised plus the free maintainence thing i guess is a wash | I am now a MB man from BMW boy | 
 "words": This is my first luxury car | My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Camry which served its purpose for a while but was incredibly boring and slow | After a few months of research I was between the C300 and the Infiniti G35 37 | The G37 is an exceptional car and definitely more performance-oriented than the Mercedes but there was something just too similar to Nissan Toyota about it that turned me off | I went with the C300 and am very happy with it | I decided to opt for the multimedia p1 and ipod connector while I was considering the p2 package for the xenons and fold-down rear seats it just did not warrant the added cost | Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase and have no complaints | 
 "words": I was looking at this car and the BMW 3 series and Plaza also has BMW | My family all liked the C300 better after test driving both although the 3 series was an auto and the Merc was 6 speed | So far the car is great very smooth enough power and room | I also test drove the Passat CC and felt that you had sunk into the car and it was hard to see out of it | The good thing about this car is that I didn't order any fancy electronic doo-dads and the only options on it are the ipod connector and wood dash trim | Overall I would recommend this car because it is solidly built and drives well | 
 "words": Reliable functional excellent exterior styling | Very neat clean sober interior aesthetics | Before buying I compared it to 3 Series and Lexus IS350ES | Interiors were one the primary reasons why I chose this car | 
 "words": I initially looked at the Mercedes because it is one of the few 6 cyl cars that are available in a manual transmission | I test drove the 328i sedan on the same day as the 300 | My whole family liked the c 300 better for the ride and the sitting position comfort | The 328 was an auto | It seemed like the engine of the 328 was straining and a bit noisier than the 300 | Also it was difficult to get a 328i without a bunch of add- ons | Same with the Infinity G-37 MT | It was difficult to find without so many options | The only options on my 300 are the burl walnut dash trim and the ipod adapter | So the list on my car was around 34000 |

 "words": I picked my C350W at the Sindelfingen factory as part of the European Delivery Alps Black Forest rally trip | The level of comfort quiet and road performance is simply outstanding | As an engineer I really appreciate all of the hidden details and overall sophistication in the design features | I have driven stretches of autobahn at 110 MPH and the car is serenely quiet and rock solid at this speed | This is combined with strong brakes effortless tracking on winding country roads and unexpectdly good mileage on this trip 24 | 9 MPG overall | Firm seating comfortable for long stretches awesome HK Logic 7 sound system smart HID lights and great instrumentation and controls | 
 "words": This is car is amazing | It has great pick up amazing sound system and great standard features | It's fun to drive and gets many looks | I have had it for almost two months and it keeps getting better with time | I find myself making excuses so I can go drive the car | Well worth the price | 
 "words": Was on the fence between the M3 E63 '09 CTS-V and the C63 | Boy did I make the right choice | This car is absolutely amazing | I hit 160 and the car felt like it was just getting started | Only complaint is the tires already had to replace at 7k miles but that was more a function of driver hee hee | Anyway this sedan is the real deal | My wife who I had to convince to let me buy even loves to take it out for the occassional Sunday stroll | 
 "words": This car drives like it should cost twice of what it did | For the money you can't beat it | Very disappointed with the paint bugs left marks on the front spoiler and hood wash twice a week and it still took the paint off | Love the car but wouldn't buy another one because of the cheap paint | 
 "words": I was all set to buy a BMW 3 series as it comes with a free maintainence package but my cousin who has a new C class took me for a test drive and the result I bought one | whatever you talk it's the best by far an large | I drove to DC from NY and back the same day looking and feeling as fresh | This is the best car you can ever own for the price | People talk of performance of 3 series BMW well I also used to | But what's the meaning of performance if other aspects are compromised plus the free maintainence thing i guess is a wash | I am now a MB man from BMW boy | 
 "words": This is my first luxury car | My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Camry which served its purpose for a while but was incredibly boring and slow | After a few months of research I was between the C300 and the Infiniti G35 37 | The G37 is an exceptional car and definitely more performance-oriented than the Mercedes but there was something just too similar to Nissan Toyota about it that turned me off | I went with the C300 and am very happy with it | I decided to opt for the multimedia p1 and ipod connector while I was considering the p2 package for the xenons and fold-down rear seats it just did not warrant the added cost | Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase and have no complaints | 
 "words": I was looking at this car and the BMW 3 series and Plaza also has BMW | My family all liked the C300 better after test driving both although the 3 series was an auto and the Merc was 6 speed | So far the car is great very smooth enough power and room | I also test drove the Passat CC and felt that you had sunk into the car and it was hard to see out of it | The good thing about this car is that I didn't order any fancy electronic doo-dads and the only options on it are the ipod connector and wood dash trim | Overall I would recommend this car because it is solidly built and drives well | 
 "words": Reliable functional excellent exterior styling | Very neat clean sober interior aesthetics | Before buying I compared it to 3 Series and Lexus IS350ES | Interiors were one the primary reasons why I chose this car | 
 "words": I initially looked at the Mercedes because it is one of the few 6 cyl cars that are available in a manual transmission | I test drove the 328i sedan on the same day as the 300 | My whole family liked the c 300 better for the ride and the sitting position comfort | The 328 was an auto | It seemed like the engine of the 328 was straining and a bit noisier than the 300 | Also it was difficult to get a 328i without a bunch of add- ons | Same with the Infinity G-37 MT | It was difficult to find without so many options | The only options on my 300 are the burl walnut dash trim and the ipod adapter | So the list on my car was around 34000 |

 "words": My wife and I purchased a 2009 C300 this past May at a local dealership | We got employee pricing via a friend who works there | We read a lot of great reviews and some bad reviews and found both sides to be true | The car drives smooth and quietly on highways and backroads but is boring to drive | The suspension is soft but contolled | The engine is smooth but drinks gas like an SUV | It is also not that powerful for a 46k luxury car | The exterior look is what got us to consider it but the interior plastics are very low quality | Steering is a bit disconnected | The brakes feel squishy after long high speed stops |

 "words": Got the Mercedes after having being a happy driver of two Honda Accords since 1994 | Then carefully planned a new purchase after having tried many similar size entry level luxury sedans both German and Japanese | Went for the Mercedes for its optimal combination of smooth ride quality plenty of power last Honda was around 140 hp quality built and of course the looks | Mine came manual still love the thrill of shifting gears with all the high end packages so came to about 42000 pretty similar to other cars in that category | So far driven it for a week with a good combo of city and highway mileage and love it | And any manual car only gets better with time |
