REVIEWS
 "words": Perfection describes the new tl sh-awd | My wife recently traded in her fully loaded Acadia for a loaded tl | I also owned a Lexus is in the past | We test drove everything out- Lexus audis BMW's infiniti's then we drove this gem | The tl has an amazing technology package -ipod connection cd hdd hard drive and XM | It even holds pictures uploaded via the usb port | The navi is crystal clear and gigantic -I love to see the live weather | This car is comfortable and a blast to drive | I drove it across the country and enjoyed every minute | The leather is so soft | The 300 horses blows m3's out of the water and I can still get 25 plus mpg's | Test drive one and you will see | 
 "words": I drove a G37x A4 and 3 series | This car was by far the most technologically advanced car and had the best price | We are thrilled with it | Drives like a dream and the tech package makes the car extremely entertaining | The sound system is incredible | I don't think I have ever heard music sound as good | Very smooth ride yet feels sporty when you want to push it hard | 
 "words": Having had great experience with our two other Hondas we chose the TL over the Accord EXL-V6 for a nicer interior and quieter ride | So far this car has not disappointed providing a proven drive-train in an upscale fun to drive car | Power and handling are great but the ride is a little stiff | It does absorb potholes better the the Accord and is much quieter | Tech Package is easy to learn without reading the 2 thick manual and the sound system is excellent | This car is currently a bargain costing thousands less than foreign assembled competitors | 
 "words": I might be writing this prematurely as I have only had my new Acura for a week | But wow this car in unbelievable | I test drove Infiniti G37 and Lexus GS | I can't imagine a vehicle with more bang for the buck | I love the styling performance handling and navigation system | 
 "words": Hands down the best interior in its class | I love the exterior too | This is one car that won't get lost in the parking lot | I have the pearl white and get compliments all the time | This car handles beautifully especially around corners | When it comes to how people drive 99 | 9 of the time this car wins hands down | If you are instead intent on taking your car through a slalom course maybe pay the extra 10k for similarly equipped BMW or sacrifice interior luxury and resale value and go for a g37 | My 2nd TL and I've been very impressed with how solid these cars are | Never had problems with either | 
 "words": I have had this car for three months now | I applaud Acura for finally taking the lead with a fresh bold design for the TL | The car | s styling is simply brilliant inside and out | The superbly integrated Tech | package brings the car | s substance on par with its stunning looks | For the last 15 years I | ve only driven German cars | Before buying the TL I also considered Audi A4 BMW 535x VW CC VR6 Infiniti G37x and the Lexus ES350 | All things considered my final analysis led me straight to the TL | 
 "words": The TL packs a lot of car for the price | You can easily pay 1000s more for a comparably equipped German car | Enjoy all the tech features they packed | For a 1st year car it feels pretty darn solid with no rattles so far | The ride is sporty but yet still maintains a luxury feel as well | The interior space is more than adequate to seat 5 in comfort | I like the high-tech look of the dash | The exterior style had me at first glance so it just works for me | I could think of improvements but I think I'm being picky at that point | The TL presents a value proposition that can't be beat | 
 "words": Although the exterior of this styling seems a bit awkward the first time one of them drive past me on the freeway I was hooked | It's angular styling is actually quite brilliant | I purchased one for my wife in the pearl white color and we get nothing but compliments | The ride is pleasant and the engine has plenty of power for entertaining launches onto freeways and long jaunts to LA | In fact the day after I bought it I put over 400 miles on it driving to southern California and it was excellent | I also have a loaded Honda Accord and I'll admit that I used to think Acura TL's were just a dressed-up Accord | But I am a believer now that the Acura is a much nicer car even in standard trim | 
 "words": Just got the car | Tried to buy a Genesis first but could not get right with the dealer | Glad he wouldn't bargain | TL is like a sports car lots of fun to drive | Great handling and performance | Only drawback is interior space | 
 "words": We purchased our TL with Technology Package 1 week ago | We continue to be amazed at the performance and the amount of features per dollar | We have received many compliments on the vehicles looks both inside and out | It is roomy enough for the two of us and our 2yr old | She has more leg room in the back then she did in our old vehicle-a Saab 9-7x SUV | 
 "words": I have owned my Acura for three weeks now | I am a little disappointed because I had to take it back to the dealer for a problem with the rear passenger door | A sensor is not working properly and causing the alarm go off | Otherwise this car is a lot fun | The technology is second to none | No other car offers the same package of technology | This car is much smoother and better built than the 2006 model which I had owned for three years | My only regret is not getting the AWD | 
 "words": As soon as you start to initiate a corner the suspension grabs the road feeling even more secure | I don't know how they accomplished this and I wish I had a picture to show you the linkage near the rear tires | There's days I like to slumber home and the new TL coddles you home | Put the gear shifter into sport mode using the paddle shifters and the suspension seems to tighten up I wonder if it has to do with the transmission either advancing the vehicle or slowing the car down when you let off the accelerator when you want to race around nice | Ipod flash and hard drive integration are easy to use and once you get used to them you wonder how you lived without them | 
 "words": I've owned Hondas in the past and upgraded to the TL | Love the car | Lot of tech w voice controls XM radio etc | Holds the road well good acceleration and getting 27 mpg on the highway commute with about 600 miles on the car | My only complaint is the seat is very stiff and will probably prove tiring on a long trip | 
 "words": I compared the RL with the TL and there is no comparison | The TL has a better drive better gas mileage more pickup and cost 5000 less | I was surprised that the two models are about the same size | The AWD is great in the snow | I previously had a BMW 750 and am not disappointed | It takes time to learn how to use all the features | 
 "words": I love this car | Its my 3rd Acura and my favorite by far | I wasn't sure about the rotating wheel on the navigation system at first but now that I have driven it for a few weeks I have completely changed my mind | No more glare on the screen it almost looks high def | I looked at other cars infinity G35 Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima just to see how it compared and I think I got the best car for my money | Its luxurious in the inside and and the tech package makes a tech freak like me very very happy | 
 "words":  My last three cars now have been Acuras an 04TL and a 06RL | I've been waiting for the 09 all summer | The wait was well worth it | Having driven the SHAWD RL I wish I didn't have to sacrifice that option for the tech package but I wanted the audio upgrade more | I am very happy | The car handles great with a nice feel for the road | Plenty of power with a luxury interior | The audio and nav system is great | Big improvement over the 06RL | This car is really a cross between the TL and RL | I realize there are many choices out there for 40K | But for my money the 09 TL Tech fills my needs quite well | One more thing just get in it and drive | Don't worry about all the tech stuff settings etc | figure out later | 
 "words": This week I drove the first new TL SH-AWD off the lot here in NYC and this car is nothing short of an absolute black top carving rocket | I drove the front wheel drive model which was nice but can't hold a candle to the power and handling of the SH-AWD version | The tight power and control carves through turns and is every bit the powerful car Acura has ever built | The Tech package give you everything you could need from a fast clear nav system with tons of features iPhone integration including music and phonebook | I owned a TL from the previous generation and this new version improves on everything that I didn't like about the old version and the SH-AWD makes it into the car I always wanted | 
 "words": Having driven many competitive vehicles bmw lexus audi cadillac infiniti etc the value of the 2009 TL is simply in a class of its own | With excellent power a very comfortable ride and an amazing tech package this car has been a blast to own | Also after a couple of 600 mile road trips I am averaging 28 mpg highway and around 20 mpg in the city | Outstanding fuel economy for a car this powerful | I do miss having a RWD powertrain but Acura has mostly eliminated the torque steer from their previous efforts and I am sure the fwd helps with fuel economy | A little more body roll than I want but a comparable 5 series bmw that offers better cornering was 15K | 
 "words": What can I say 4th Acura and it gets better every time | I didn't like the grille at 1st but I had it painted to match the body color and its a lot better | Walks away from the competition in every aspect | 
 "words": A few weeks ago I purchased this 2009 Acura TL and absolutely love it | This Acura TL is super quiet super smooth super fast and super solid | It tracks like a locomotive and never loses its composer | I traded a 2008 Lexus ES350 for this Acura and I am very proud of my decision | The Lexus felt cheap and sloppy when compared to this Acura TL | This is the best choice I made | 
 "words": Have had the car for about 2 weeks now and so far all I can say is awesome | Had an '04 Infiniti G35 AWD and it rattled like crazy | Then a '07 Lexus ES 350 great car but boring to drive and expensive with options | The new TL takes the best of both those cars and puts it into one attractive fun to drive package | The nav | system and sound system are top notch | Fit and finish are great and with only 600 miles on the car I am avg | 20 mpg in the city not bad for a car with 280 hp | The seats feel good and the steering wheel has a nice feel to it | The kid in me loves the paddle shifters | 
 "words": The 2009 Acura is Superman with a Robin costume on | I'm sure there are some who love Robin's outfit but more I'm sure more prefer Supermans outfit | The styling is too love it or hate it in my opinion | Besides that Acura got it right | They really should get rid of the stock wheels as someone as mentioned too | The upgraded wheels are what should be standard on this car | 
 "words": I am a fan of Acura cars having owned a 2003 Acura TL 2004 TL and 2008 TSX | Overall I found the 2009 TL to be an improvement over the 2004 TL but there are some little things that I dislike The soft armrest for your right elbow that slides forward that was present in preceding models is now gone | I miss this | The trunk lid is now higher so you have to lift things higher to put them in the trunk | When accelerating the engine revs more than the older TLs | What I dislike most is that the steering is too light and feels unnatural | Pros The interior feels luxurious and upscale | The navi is quicker and the screen sharper and brighter | 
 "words": Overall this car is a great value for all that's included in the price | I like the bold exterior styling that sets it apart from all the other boring vanilla cars out there | Performance handling ride features and build quality is much improved over the previous generation | Interior is also greatly improved and roomier than before | The nav system and ELS surround system are both top-notch | Fuel economy is also decent I'm averaging about 20-21 in city driving | 
 "words": Engine is smooth and powerful but produces some torque steer on the FWD model | Without the AWD option its easily the best value compared to competitors | This car is a geek's best friend | The interior is full of innovative technologies such as a nav system that routes around bad weather and automatic climate control that tracks the sun's position in the sky | The stereo is impressive but the built-in hard drive is limited to playing ripped CDs no directly loading mp3 files | The car is very easy to control with electronic steering and downshifting the transmission for engine braking is extremely smooth | But it would be nice if Honda moved to a 6-speed or better to match Toyota | 
 "words": I owned a 1999 Acura TL with Navi and drove that for 120000 miles | It was a very good car | 10 years later Acura does it again | I had to get used to the front and rear end of the car but after a couple of weeks I love the design changes | If you put any other car next to it other cars just look dated | The standard wheels that come with the car are my biggest complaint | This car really deserves the upgraded wheels which cost me an extra 2500 dollars | I got the ones that are two tone | There are way too many advanced features that I wont list all of them | Go to your Acura dealership and check out the tech package | It simply blows away anything else out there | I am very happy | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Acura a 2000 TL a 2003 TL-S and the 2009 TL | Far and away the 2009 is the best | love the style and the interior is outstanding | Handles great | 
 "words": Had a 2005 Mercedes E500 4Matic and was looking for a car that had the same size engine and same size interior | Have had the TL SH AWD HPT for over a month and this car does not disappoint | The handling is unbelievable and the power acceleration is very good | Drove the G37x and the CTS 4 and the TL was just a better car for the money | The ride can be a little stiff and you can feel the bumps on a rough road which is why I gave a rating of 8 for comfort | Overall though the ride is good and the cabin is very quiet | Also the tech package is a must | Easy to use and I use the real time weather a lot more than I thought I would | And I like the front back design | It is edgy different | 
 "words": I absolutely love the styling inside and out | There has been some criticism in the press about looks but to me it looks strikingly different and fresh | Same with the inside | There's a knock on the the multitude of buttons bit I rarely go to the console because everything is voice activated and besides that's so much more fun | The novelty of saying set driver temperature 70 degrees still isn't wearing off | Being a Honda I'm sure reliability will be bullet proof | Acceleration is OK but I do give it low scores for handling my only disappointment | Once you set up for a turn it's stable and secure but transitions and aggressive moves are not this car's forte | Still a great car | 
 "words": Coming from a 08 TL | Test drove many times both AWD FWD w tech | Got a mixed feeling like other 08 TL owners did | Technology beats other competitors like G37 or 08 TL | But not sure why such an advanced car has to skip auto-dimmed side mirrors ventilated seats rain-sensing wiper etc | On a 08' TL I don't have to pay for the tech package to get ELS sound system and the perforated leather | Still a very good car for the price level but option-wise you want to ask yourself what's really important to you vs | what it has to offer | 
 "words": The 2009 Acura TL AWD is a fantastic car | It was well-built inside and out | I previously leased a Lexus ES 350 and the driving was night and day compared to this TL | I am one of those who love the look of the TL and appreciate the boldness of the Acura design team | In my opinion the TL is a wonderful bang for the buck | Where else can you find a comparable car with all the driving and technological capabilities for less than 40000 | 
 "words": Just got the 2009 Acura TL AWD Tech today | Wow what a great car this is | The handling was superb and the drive is fun and comfortable | I love the Technology Package and especially the voice recognition system | 
 "words": Fast enough quiet enough and lots of tech features for the money | Shopped 335 and G35 but TL had the best blend of luxury comfort with performance | It's not a compact sports sedan but it is everything else that you can ask for south of 35K | 
 "words": I live in New England and drive 33000 miles a year for my sales position | I recently purchased 09 TL AWD with the Tech Package | I upgraded from a 2004 Honda Accord V6 that had 163K Miles on it | What convinced me to buy and Acura was the reliability of my Honda and the trade-in value of my car | When the dust settled I walked out the door paying 30K with my trade-in | I looked at several competitors but kept coming back to Acura | The handling of the TL AWD and the Tech Package won me over | I plan to keep the car for 5-years and expect it will be very reliable and hold it's value when it comes time to trade it in | If you don't look at the TL you miss out on an excellent vehicle | 
 "words": After test driving G37 IS350 and TL AWD I and my wife both agreed to purchase TL AWD | We are very happy with excellent ride quality of TL and its amazing tech package and reliability | Suspension is little hard for un-paved road driving but it was all expected | I am getting average of 22 mpg which is not bad I think considering its 3 | 7L 300hp engine | 
 "words": Coming off of a 2006 Lincoln Zephyr I test drove almost every luxury car you can think of | None of these cars have anything on the TL especially the price | This car is amazing | I was loyal to my Lincolns but this car is on a whole different level | I got the car for under invoice and they ate my last two payments on my Zephyr can't beat that | Smoother quiet and a lot better looking than the G37x the Lexus nice car but overpriced and the interior is ugly | 
 "words": Excellent Car | The Tech Package is awesome I purchased the car almost 2 weeks ago and I am still finding new neat features | Very pleased to find out that my family of 5 can ride comfortably in the car me my wife my 9 year old my 8 year old and my 15 month old with car seat | Get one | 
 "words": I have only had it for less than a month but everyday I love this car more and more | The nav climate control and other tech features it has takes a little time to get used to | It handles great the ride is comfortable and it looks awesome | 
 "words": Compared to other cars that I drove in several different classes this car gave me the most bang for the buck | The space that the car provides and quality of all the finishes compared to other cars at its price point is superior | 
 "words": I'm a first time Acura owner sold my 2002 Volvo S60 before purchasing my TL | This car is amazing comfortable power and fun to drive | The SH-AWD is great the car is glued to the road at all speeds in turns | I looked at the Lexus RX350 and was sure I was going to buy that but Lexus will not discount the price so I test drove the TL and bought it the same day | 
 "words": Okay | At first I didn't like the styling of the new TL | But I have to admit it has grown on me | I love the sexy shape the way it handles and the well designed interior | Before purchasing the TL I test drove the Lexus IS 250 and the BMW 325I | The IS was too slow 4cyl engine in a 35K dollar vehicle | and the BMW didn't offer much in terms of standard equipment | I basically chose the TL as I felt I got more bang for my buck | And we all know Acura makes quality vehicles | 
 "words": My TL handles so well and is one of the most comfortable rides I've had especially upgrading from a Honda Prelude | The voice recognition for the Navi Climate Control and radio is awesome | It's still a bit of a learning curve though but one of the best features | The TL has provided me with the best driving experience thus far | 
 "words": Recently purchased a new SH-AWD with Tech package | Pros 1 Easy to use navigation 2 Inside layout's neat and makes sense | 3 Bigger interior spaces and more room for back seats | 4 Push button engine start | 6 Price is right compared to other competitors | Cons 1 suspension is too stiff that you can feel every tiny tiny bump of the road | Any ride longer than 10 minutes in the city is not enjoyable | 2 back trunk is relatively high for putting away heavier objects and it's small as well | 3 Some of the interior materials feel cheap plastic of door pockets bring the car down | 4 seats are not comfortable as the previous two TL models I had driven | 
 "words": This is my first new car and what a car it is | Fun to drive and the technology can be overwhelming sometimes but still great | I already put 500 miles on my car after just 1 week because I want to drive it everyday | The SH-AWD is great the car is glued to the road during all types of conditions | I'm averaging 28MPG on the highway and I've seen has high as 40mpg | 
 "words": I can't say enough about my 09 TL basic model | It comes equipped with features you'd expect to find in a much more expensive car | Best deal on the market | 
 "words": Just bought my new 09 TL base love the car already | I traded in my 02 because the transmission went out right in front of the dealership it must have been a sign | Everything in this car is 100 improved from the 02 model | I looked at ES350 nice car but once you add all the options just too much and the G37 it was too small | Best car you can get out there for the money hands down
 "words": This car is one fun vehicle | Great technology great handling fast well fast enough for me and fun to drive | This is high praise coming from a BMW owner for the past 20 years | I test drove a new and a used BMW 535i back to back with the Acura and the Acura won my heart mind and pocket book | 
 "words": Just leased a TL w Tech about 4 days ago and all I can say is WOW | I love this car so much it is powerful roomy and has very nice styling | I get head turns everywhere I go | I got the WDP Taupe and I just love it | The NAV and Bluetooth are so easy to use and the NAV screen is really clear | This is definitely the best car for the money | I have owned Acura's before and they did a really good job on this new TL | I love every minute I'm driving in it | 
 "words": Awesome style fun to drive especially the AWD | Ride is firm but not rough at all | Interior is super quiet while on freeway etc | Awesome build quality drives perfect | and may be the first vehicle I have purchased which will not require a re-visit to the dealer for any mechanical balancing alignment etc | Every other car I have purchased in the last 20 years had to be taken back | Toyota Lexus Nissan GM | Love it love it love it | Awesome in black | 
 "words": Upgraded from a Volvo S80 that was 8 years old | The car is a great ride very responsive | Glued to the road on turns | Love all the technology | And while I know that previous TL owners by and large hate the styling | I'm good with it | From the side I think it's awesome | I've waited 5 months to put this review up | I have no real complaints except the ride is a bit firm for my tastes after the Volvo and I'd expect better than 22mpg these days | 
 "words": I have owned my new TL w Tech for almost 3 weeks and I have to say that I am really enjoying this car | I was leasing a 2006 Infiniti G35x and was contemplating a new one | After driving the new TL I was no longer interested in the G | The TL has a new exterior design that turns heads | The interior of the TL blows the Infiniti away | Everything feels solid and of very high quality | I have also been getting better gas mileage than I got in my old G35x | There is no other car in this price range that gives you the quality and the amenities found in the TL | 
 "words": The SH-AWD model is not a car | it's an automobile | The seats hug your body | The steering wheel grips your hands | The sound system is an on-demand DJ | And the power is to be compared to a 200 meter sprinter | not super fast | but fast | But the coolest thing about the car is its smarts | My wife keeps her key in her bag | She attempted to put her bag with the key in the trunk and the car beeped and popped back open the truck | Oh yes I am most certainly enjoying my 2009 TL SH-AWD | 
 "words": I had an Infiniti M35x and wanted a cheaper monthly payment without sacrificing the luxury | Looked at BMW 3 and Volkswagen CC | BMW was too expensive and everything was extra and VW was a little too small | The TL had everything I wanted standard heated seats sunroof and bluetooth | Dealer added the decklid spoiler for free | Engine is powerful and seats are comfortable | A little more road noise comes in than I would have liked | Dash layout is nice looks modern and sporty | Steering is nice and tight | Fuel economy is great 22 considering I averaged 14 mpg with the M35 | I like the ipod connectivity | Good sounding stereo | I like this car a lot | 
 "words": Upgraded from a 2004 Chrysler Sebring 2 door coupe | Tech package is awesome | I have taken the car on a long road trip and was very impressed with the handling and the ride | The fit and finish from the interior and exterior is first rate | 
 "words": I bought my TL with Technology package a week ago and I love it | I compared the TL to Infinity G37 and Lexus ES350 and here is what I found | The G37 was great to drive but has unimpressive interior and feels small the ES350 is very comfortable to ride but un- sporty to drive and large the TL has amazing interior advanced technology package fun to drive and but ugly grill beak | So I decided that was easier to live with that | beak | after painting it | 
 "words": Picked up this 2009 TL Sho With tech package 4 2009 and I must say the nav system is much better than in my 05 RL | The vehicle is fun to drive and I'm having a hard time staying out of it | The sound system is top notch and I love the IPod USB feature | Overall after doing much research and test driving BMW Mercedes and Infinity this is the value for the money out here | 
 "words": Had taken my 2008 TL Type S in for some routine maint and given the 2009 TL | Must say I was not disappointed but not overly impressed | Kinda left me feeling a bit ho-hum yawn | The styling of the 2009 TL is confusing | It's as if they attempted to include everything on the exterior and the result is just big question mark | What was the statement | The interior is just as confusing with all its swoops and swirls | definite disconnection | The ride was comfortable stereo sounded great seats comfortable | Acceleration was quite lacking as I've become accustomed to much more in my 08 Type S | Overall not a disappointing ride however nothing spectacular | The Tech package is extraordinary | 
 "words": Great Car I don't like the material used on the grill and trunk as the finish is already tarnishing after 2 months | I don't like rust on brake drums as well | Gas mileage needs improving | Other than that great car | 
 "words": Tested both base and SH-AWD | Would have been a great car to buy | but base model seats are too hard could feel pressure in the lumbar area | SH-AWD ride is too firm | lots of noise driving over reflectors on the road etc | Lots of reviews from extensive research say ride is too firm for a luxury car | Also unfortunately | armrests are decorative and not functional | just leather covering over a hard surface | Comfort is important to me | resting my elbows on hard surfaces while driving does not work well | Too bad | most manufacturers do not think of this even Lexus | American cars are much better on comfort | been driving GM for 20 years | Although the 09 Maxima does offer great comfort | 
 "words": Picked up our Acura tl Saturday May the 9th 2009 and we were extremely impressed with what a beauty it was and when we saw it sitting there all cleaned up I fell in love right there | We have 575 miles on the car and 530 miles was on the first tank of gas and I was getting over 26 miles per gallion | Love styling high quality ride is firm but very planted great sound system polished metal exterior what a class act and love the paddle shifters and dealer will install rear spoiler Tuesday to really set off the beautiful rear of the car also love the exhaust tips as they look awsome | Manual way too thick and confusing roomy rear seat big trunk and we just love the sleek hunkered down look | 
 "words": I just got my 2009 TL SH-AWD TECH last week | I love the design and the gadgets but I am really disappointed in the constant rattling each time I hit a bump | It sounds cheap and drives me crazy | I found out after purchase that this has been an issue with Honda Acura cars for a while | As much as I like it I am seriously considering selling the car if the dealer can't fix this | The ride in general is a little harder than I like | 
 "words": And I wanted a CTS but my wife said no- glad I listened to her | This is my second Acura MDX previously after many years in GM vehicles | This vehicle has it all styling both exterior and interior good mpg tech package is user friendly great sound system and a hard drive to record your favorite music both from CD's and the XM Radio | 
 "words": I purchased a pearl white 2009 TL with the Tech package | I owned 3 Audi A4's previously and loved them but felt the 2009 price for the A4 and BMW 335 was becoming an issue | This car is very well built and has very good road manners | It grows on me every day and I have no regrets about my decision to buy a TL | I was taken back by the size of the car at first but now it is second nature and I appreciate the room | It may not be completely as crisp to drive as a BMW or Audi but in many ways it feels better and is very solid | It is a pleasure to drive and to own | I upgraded to the stock SHAWD 18 wheels and highly suggest you do the same | really enhances road handling and appearance | 
 "words": I bought a new 2009 Acura TL w Tech Package | We were either going buy the TL or a Mercedes Benz E350 | We chose the TL because the Technology was way more advanced | However it is not the perfect car | But out of all the cars I have owned this the best so far | 
 "words": After test driving 3 different 2009 TLs w Tech while my 2007 TL was in the shop I found it was improved in many areas but took a few steps backwards that would keep me from trading my 2007 TL for a new 2009 TL not worth the price difference | Main issues was worse city mileage | 09 ratings are supposed to be fairly accurate 07 ratings were high by 10-20 | Both were rated at 18 | Driving my 07 conservatively I can get 19-20 driving the 09 the same way only got 16-17 |

 "words": My boyfriend tried getting me into the Cadillac CTS like his | I was not having it | After looking at Audi which I have wanted forever | I happened to pass by the Acura dealer | I wasn't crazy about the service we received at the dealership initially but had to go back to see if the 2nd time would be a charm and it was the car sold itself | I have a little boy in a booster seat there is plenty of room and we all fit comfortably | I love my TL | BIGGER BANG FOR YOUR BUCK | 
 "words": I am very satisfied with my purchase | with a few exceptions | The gas mileage is not very good | I did my research and expected this | However in city driving I am only averaging 14 | 3 mpg according to the computer | Hopefully the mpg will get better as more miles are racked up | I have had nothing but raves from friends and co-workers about the exterior and interior of the car | I chose Palladium Metallic with the taupe interior | I think this combination looks very good on the car | Not one person has mentioned the beak | I am not someone who likes to spend money so I did a lot of research before purchasing this Acura | I believe my decision was correct | 
 "words": The 2009 Acura TL-SHAWD w Technology Package is very fun to drive while offering interior amenities and technology that are second to none | The 09 335x is more fun to drive and faster but lacks the interior space and modern amenities | The 09 Infiniti G37 is faster but lacks the driving refinement and interior space and amenities | The 09 TL offers it all at a very competitive price | Very happy with my purchase |
