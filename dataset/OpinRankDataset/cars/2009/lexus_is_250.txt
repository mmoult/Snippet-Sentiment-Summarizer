REVIEWS
 "words": I've put 9000 miles on this IS250 Automatic | This is a pretty nice ride | Hard to believe it gets better mileage than a manual | Go figure | 
 "words": All in all a very good deal I agree with all the positive features mentioned elsewhere | I read somewhere about an annoying noise from the dashboard that starts few months after having the car and I actually noticed that it's from the driver's corner of the dashboard a high-pitch annoying noise that occurs most on unsteady roads | I play music loud while driving and that can masks it but a real disappointment | 
 "words": Just bought my 09 Lexus IS250 awd and I love it | The exterior styling is very eye catching and the interior is top quality | The seats are very comfortable the ride is very smooth and you can barely hear any road noise inside | The radio and AC area without navigation is boring but its functional | Could use a little more power but its decent and the car handles very well | Its a very small car so a small backseat is expected | The back-seats aren't usable unless the front seats are pushed very far up but all around its a great car | 
 "words": We have had this car for a month now and simply love it | The external styling is best in class and the interior is top notch | Every detail is well thought out and the fit and finish is outstanding | I can understand why other reviewers focus on the power but I consider this car a luxury car that is sporty rather than a pure sports car | We test drove the A4 2 | 0T Quattro used to own an Audi allroad and really liked it also but the interior seemed outdated and the engine although better kick did not seem as refined as the IS250 | And in the end we didn't want to be in the Audi shop all the time like we were with the allroad | Bottom line Lexus really did a fantastic job on this car | 
 "words": Traded TSX for IS250 AWD | Decided on IS over the G37 335 TL and WRX | Thought the IS had the most comfy front seats of the bunch | I was sorely wrong | Happy at first nice ride and solid handling until my right leg started to hurt | Didn't notice it much at first but after 4 weeks in this car there's a glaring stupid BUMP protruding out the driver's side | Simply cannot rest my right foot and leg in proper straight ergonomic manner | Right leg simply cannot straighten out liken a repetitive stress disorder | BUMP part of AWD trans | whole body hurts to drive | Regret buying this car will never buy AWD Lexus sedan again | May be forced to trade-in after only 1000 miles | Ridiculous | 
 "words": Coming out of a pickup I realized that it was going to be a small car | However it rides like a true sport luxury car and with all the creature comforts i | e | HID temp seats navi etc | I feel it was a good purchase | The ride is a lot better to me than a comparable c300 and 328i | Also the quality of the Lexus is second to none | The interior fit and feel makes a Benz or Beemer really feel entry level | Lastly the power | I didn't want it for the power but a little more oomph would have been great as well the back seat has 0 leg room | maybe a I250 350L would be good | 
 "words": I was considering a BMW 328i which has a much sportier feel but when I compared the features of the IS 250 to BMW Lexus proved to be a much better value | True the IS isn't a BMW but the style workmanship navigation system and options are much better than what was available with BMW and I don't have to contend with the run flat tires that come standard with the 328i | Lexus tweaked the steering to the 2009 IS and this results in a much better drive | Keyless entry system and quiet interior are wonderful | People don't realize that I am driving when I call them using the Bluetooth feature | Get the iPod connection | It works wonderfully with the 13 speaker sound system which is very good | 
 "words": Good handling sexy exterior luxury interior good pick up | 
 "words": I leased a new Lexus IS 250 AWD after being told that the new model been updated for 2009 | Yes there are some minor styling and other changes but it's still a 2006 technology platform | For example the navigation system has no text to speech no traffic info outdated maps poor routing you could do better with a portable unit for 150 | 00 | 
 "words": I've owned this car since it first came out | Picked it up at the end of December 2005 | The interior looks and feels great but it's still not Audi in terms of physical feel | The seats look great and feel soft to the touch | However after more than 45 minutes they are so soft that your rear begins to ache as you can somewhat feel the metal platform underneath | They definitely need to take some cues from Germany | Nav system is very easy to learn and use but like many others you can't use it while moving | Interior lighting with LED accents is still state of the art | 
 "words": Before buying this I test drove a lot of vehicles MB C class BMW 335 and Infiniti but IS has a different nice good taste to it more stiff in a good way than MB more stylish interior with same driving experience than BMW more style than Infiniti I think | Liked the exterior styling and standard features like fog light LED lights turn indicators on the side mirrors side mirrors are heated too | I am really very very happy with my choice and recommend you all to test drive this to realize what a nice car it is | Its Lexus |
