REVIEWS
 "words": I bought this vehicle three months ago and still I'm in love with it | It's steering and turn radius is great | It's sleek and sexy looking with a sporty feel | It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident | The interior is very stylish and although the buttons navigation system can seem intimidating it's not difficult to understand how to use it | 
 "words": Have had car for 9 mos | 17 | 5K miles averaging 29-31 mpg | I change oil every 5K no matter what oil life indicator says | Car runs fine and fast enough to get a couple of warnings | 6 speed and clutch work fine | Two complaints | 3400 RPM 80mph cruising is a little high my 2000 TL does about 2150RPM at same speed | I still have trouble with headlight pattern sharp cutoff of light field makes hills exciting when driving in mountain passes | 
 "words": I | ve had my 09 TSX 5A for 2 weeks | The car does NOT feel as underpowered as some reviews suggest an extra 20HP wouldn | t hurt | Steering is not bad could use more feel | The car likes to be driven fast unlike my old 06 TL 6M which suffered from serious torque steer and an unhappiness when driven fast | It is also very comfortable and fits like a glove everything feels right | Love the features seats steering wheel FI paddle shifters Bluetooth USB audio all cars should have this | HOWEVER there is excessive dashboard glare that washes out the central display in a lot of driving conditions | Why on earth would Acura use shiny tacky material on the dash | 
 "words": I most definitely love my car | Outstanding owner experience | Bought it in October 2008 and have logged 17K miles to date | No defects at all | I shopped Lexus BMW etc | and settled on the TSX | Final choices came down to new TSX or used TL or used BMW 330xi | Former Honda owner so in the end I wanted reliability and sacrificed AWD | The car is a pleasure to drive quiet no rattles etc | For pure fun I would have bought the BM'r but did not want to face any downstream reliability or expensive maintenance | The only minor negative is the car is really so-so in the snow even with snows | traction is not great | Everything else meets or beats my expectations | 
 "words": So after driving some used BMWs and Infiniti's I settled on this as it is brand new and has all the tech features I want | I didn't want to drop another 8-15k for the same things | So far I am very impressed with the performance although it doesn't match BMW or Infiniti | That's not why I bought it | I do not race cars for a living I drive near 80 miles per day commuting | I need fun and comfort | This car delivers on these | From the very intuitive voice recognition to the sat radio and USB interface there is so much fun to be had here | While it is much maligned by um | professional reviewers I thoroughly love this car | For under 30k it more than meets my needs and wants | 
 "words": I just made the move from BMW 3 series to Acura and I am very happy with the decision | This Acura drives like a dream and I look forward to starting it up every day | The standard features along with the Tech package give you almost every advanced feature imaginable | The performance is almost comparable to the BMW steering is a bit remote on the highway compared to a BMW and is much more reliable also less expensive to fix it is a Honda after all | I researched cars for quite some time before buying and could not find another car that combined luxury performance tech features and style as well as the Acura TSX | 
 "words": Have been driving the car for 8 months now | I found the ride too firm at first but now I am used to it | The grill-design has grown on me as well | Steering feel is also fine | it is materially better compared to my old car a 2004 V6 Camry | While not perfect it is still a very good daily-driver in my opinion | 
 "words": I have only had this car for 10 days | For myself over the past 25 years I have only purchased Honda Accords all manual trans | My last 2 have been EX- L and I have always been happy with them | I was planning since last year to buy myself another EX-L Accord 4- cyl and just by chance I checked out the TSX | I loved it | It came with everything factory installed even options like memory seats passenger power seats home-link and directional signals on outside mirrors that you couldn't even get on a loaded 4cy EX-L Accord | In my opinion the car is so much more solid luxurious than the Accord | And the gauges and trip computer are awesome | 
 "words": I traded my 2007 Mazda Miata for a 2009 Acura TSX | I thought I would miss the sporty feel the Miata had | but boy was I wrong | I love my TSX | I have only had it about 2 months | but it is amazing Plus all the bells whistles are pretty nice | And the gas mileage is great | I actually got 38 | 1 mpg on the interstate during an hour and half drive | Usually around town it gets between 28 | 5-32 mpg | I definitely would recommend this car to anyone | Great buy for your money | 
 "words": I have had so many problems with the interior quality sometimes I think I bought an American car | over the past year I've had two blown audio speakers loose defroster vent two trunk rattles Navi screen control unit failure loose exterior windshield molding and a rattle coming from the dashboard that the dealer can't seem to locate fix | The only thing keeping me sane is that the deal provides a loaner car every time I bring in my car for service which is about once per month | 
 "words": Bought this a couple months ago | I traded in a 2007 Nissan 350Z roadster for this | I haven't regretted it a bit | The comfort build quality and features far out weigh the lost HP | I highly recommend the 2009 Acura TSX over anything else in its class | 
 "words": I just picked up my TSX | Traded 2005 TL | I love the new TL but it's too big I was looking for better fuel economy | The ELS music system is outstanding combined with the GPS which comes with a back up camera in my mine no car for this price can compare | The car is very quiet for a 4 cylinder and has more than enough power | The fit and finish is perfect | It's just the size car I needed with all the bells whistles | I looked at the Audi A4 as well as the 3 series BMW | Both of these would have cost me over 40000 with the same equipment | A great car at a very fair price | 
 "words": In a nutshell the tech package is the icing of a great cupcake | The car itself is a inline 4 but it's better than my old accord v6 | It's not as fast my other tl type s but the horsepower and torque is not wasted either | That's what this car is it's the comfort of the tech package do not get this car without it with a car that's designed for everyday use with some sport appeal | It's definitely fun to drive it comes to stock with a stability bar for handling can you believe that | It's car loaded with value and a fun drive factor to boot | I've test driven other cars that were reviewed and found this one to be the best | 
 "words": I bought my car the 1st week the '09 TSX babies went on sale | I don't regret a thing | I looked at the IS A4 MB C-class Volvo's of various models and the TSX won hands down with features reliability | Magnificent car | Love the navi knob a touch screen would require the eyes to be 'off the road' | My TSX has a telescoping steering wheel and a 6 disc in-dash CD player | All my friends love my car | At night the interior looks awesome | UFO style | Fun car will last a long time | 
 "words": I moved up to the 2009 TSX from a 2006 TSX | The Grigio dark copper graphite color is strikingly elegant | Although exterior styling resembles the circa 2006 models this is a total redesign inside and out | Added length and width make this car appear as large as a pre-2009 TL | Inside this benefits rear seat passengers who now enjoy a lot more legroom | Other interior differences are the premium sound which on the non-tech is FAR superior to the rather dismal offering in my 2006 TSX and includes a sub woofer for deep and thumping bass | 
 "words": I | ve been driving my 2009 TSX for a little over 4 weeks and have had an opportunity to compare in detail to my 2005 TSX which I still own | The 2009 TSX is a far superior vehicle in terms of driving comfort acceleration handling cabin noise low speed maneuverability turning radius fuel economy and overall refinement | I have read the professional reviews and my conclusion is that these people drive the car for a few hours on a test track in situations that are not representative of daily driving conditions for the average buyer of this vehicle | Having said that I do agree that 2009 TSX is not a | sports | sedan and probably should not be marketed as one by Acura | 
 "words": Had the car for about a month now | Went from 2000 Infiniti G20 so TSX was a natural progression for me | That being said the power and the pickup is far greater | Acura maximizes the ability of a 4 cyl engine while making it fuel efficient | Getting about 27-29 mpg in 70-30 highway driving | I'd advise not to take your MPG reading off the monitor and actually calculate it yourself you'll find it to be about 1-2 MPG difference but still great mileage | Note that this is an everyday sports sedan | If you want a high performance sports car get a BMW 3 series or Lexus IS-250 | The rest of us who go to work everyday want to have a little fun and not pay a fortune in doing so will enjoy this car
 "words": Bought myself a TSX for my birthday upgrading from a 98 VW that had lost its lust for life as well as my love of driving and I am astounded at how much I love to drive this car and how others react to it | Its powerful responsive comfortable efficient and for the price to what you get its second to none | I am still getting used to parking it in a small parking lot but the majority of that is new car jitters | Everything thats important is top-notch some of the small things I would have changed | Others have mentioned the screen glare bluetooth mic is ho-hum and far away elbow rests take some effort lower grille is weak plastic and deforms in weeks and radio forgets settings | 
 "words": I had a 2006 TSX that I loved | So when my lease expired I jumped on a new 2009 TSX without even bothering to test drive | Big mistake | They've taken the fun out of driving with the addition of electronic steering | I can't feel the car | I feel detached from the whole experience I used to love about driving | The odd thing is the suspension is still tight enough to feel the road beneath me while still giving it stability in the corners which I can no longer feel | The slight increase in size from the previous model wasn't put to good use | The interior feels cavernous adding one more level of remove from the feel of driving | 
 "words": The ads are not aiming at a young spirited 65 year old male | Previous 2005 TL owner love the new TSX | Front seat wraps around and supports well the handling is taut but not to stiff acceleration is adequate | Back seat a little too tight for 3 men over 170 lbs the cd should have more than room than 1 disc | Sound quality is crisp on a trip from Boca Raton FL to Boston average mpg 34 | 5 excellent around the city mpg approx | 24 | I kept within 70 mph | Good mileage can be achieved if ego does not get in the way | People on cape cod and in the city have favorably mentioned the new styling | I do not feel add the old model is better this is new car with a different cachet | 
 "words": I have a 2009 TSX now and a 2008 Honda Accord EX | Both cars are great | My Girlfriend drives the TSX and I drive the Accord | I will have to say though that the performance of the TSX is a little less than that of the Accord | Both are great though and synonymous in there attitude | I love the 2 | 4 litre powerplant it is really a great workhorse | 
 "words": Since I picked it up I love the car | It's fun to drive and a lot of people talk about how nice the car is | I love the bluetooth and how easy it is to talk and for people to hear you | I think Acura really did a good job | 
 "words": I have had the car 1 month 2K miles and averaged 33 | 5 mpg | I can't imagine not having the tech package | The stereo cannot be matched crisp clean strong and the nav is very easy to use | The 6 speed manual is the soul of the car the steering did take some getting used to and became more predictive over time | It is not a point and shoot car like the Mazda3 S that I had but it handles quite nicely with a much more refined feel | The engine is very sweet in the upper RPM I have not found that I wished for more power especially at 4 gallon | The seats are extremely comfortable | 
 "words": I've had the car for just over 2 months and love it | Pearl White Ebony Great color and people stop me in parking lots to ask about the car | Got rid of a 2005 | 5 A4 | Love the fit and finish got 35 mpg on the highway WOW | Great style interior xenons loaded a lot of car for the | Do not miss Audi or the higher payments | 
 "words": I've been driving this car for about two weeks now and loving every minute of it | Keep in mind I switched from a V6 with over 240 HP and torque | I was hesitant about getting a 4 cyl but you can't tell the difference in every day driving with this car | It has more than enough power I'm not drag racing from a stop sign or traffic light | The handling is excellent | The interior is top of the line Japan quality and has more room than the Lexus IS | I didn't need the navi system but the stock premium audio sound systems sounds great | 
 "words": I purchased this car in July of '08 | I considered BMW Lexus Audi Accord and a few others | But the features for price comfort drive won hands down | Car drives great awesome handling with steering good acceleration use pedal shifters | fun | I've always wanted an Acura and this was the exact way to finally step into the brand | Had considered the '08 and the '09 TSX | The redesigned exterior of the '09 is what won me over and took a bigger chunk out my pocketbook | 
 "words": I have had nothing but Volvos since 1982 | TSX compared favorably with S80 328 IS 250 CTS and was cheaper | MPG has been great 36 hwy and 30overall | I still haven't mastered the tech pack | That lady doesn't understand KYeze | I have one negative Steering is very sensitive and feels notchy in turns and there is sometimes a distinct steering torque with acceleration in turns | I have not investigated with dealer | One more thing don't break a mirror 525 | So far dealer experience has been very positive | 
 "words": I have only owned the car a few weeks but I love it so far | I traded in a 2007 Mazda 6s and have been thrilled so far | A total upgrade smoother ride surprising power from the high strung I4 F1 technology at its best perfect fit and finish | You can feel the quality and the features are easy to get use to | Sporty european styling gets me nothing but compliments where ever I take it | I hope to enjoy it down the road as much as I do now | 
 "words": I bought this car 2 weeks ago and am unhappy with the vehicle overall | The fit and finish is poor for a car of this caliber | I'm noticing many inconsistencies in the paint and window molding | The felt trunk lining is already coming loose | The car lacks power | If I had to do it over again I would have sprung for an Infiniti or Lexus | I will be selling this car the first chance I get | Stay away from Acura spend more money and get a higher quality car | 
 "words":  I just don't get it | In a lot of magazines reviews and forums people slam this car as not as good as the old and not as powerful as the G35 etc | It costs another 5 grand to get the same options on these other cars | For the money this is the best thing going | The old car got great reviews and this car is even more improved than that one | I like the styling and from what I have seen it is the best looking car in the new Acura lineup | This car is not sluggish at all but it is not made for drag racing | What I value most of all in terms of performance is the handling | This thing takes corners well and I've never gotten a ticket for cornering | The tech package is the way to go hands down | 
 "words": I bought my 09 tsx about a month ago and have nothing but good things to say about it | I was torn between the 08 accord and tsx after test driving both the choice was simple | The tsx test drive was superior | I commute 120 miles a day and I am truly impressed with the ride and comfort of this car | I love the car and have nothing to say but good things about it | It is great on gas and a blast to drive and compares nicely to those pricey luxury vehicles | The bluetooth is great and with Acura's well known performance and reliability you cannot go wrong with this car | 
 "words": The car is gorgeous | I have gotten so many compliments on its appearance and luxury features | I didn't do the performance package because it wasn't worth the extra 3000 | 00 when I can use my handheld Garmin instead | The steering is very sensitive at highway speeds and needs a gentle touch | I'm only getting about 24 mpg with a combination of around town and highway | I was between the TSX the Honda Accord Audi A4 | I am very happy with my decision | There is plenty of leg room both front and back | I had a friend who was 6'4 comfortably in the back | Plenty of headroom and a huge step up from the Honda Accord in performance comfort and appearance | Well worth a few extra dollars | 
 "words": We only considered Lexus IS or ES and TSX | We have owned 2009 TSX for 2 weeks | It is bigger than IS which is a good thing and a bad thing | We bought TSX mainly for the interior | My wife does not like the exterior but I really like it | The car is the right size for us but maybe too big for people who need to navigate through tight garage | It is the just the best value for entry level luxury sedan you get a lot for the money | You have to test drive it to know if you like it or not | EPS saves power | 
 "words": I just bought this car a week ago and I'm beyond thrilled | Being my first new car purchase out of graduate school I knew I wanted the reliability of Acura read Honda and practical while still sporty | This fits the bill perfectly | Sure the grille looks a little odd or Mazda Saturn-like but that's about the only gripe for me | The i-VTEC engine is a great blend of spunk fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness even though I'm not on the save the planet boat it's still impressive to see a ULEV vehicle that can still perform | The six-speed transmission and the tech package are the way to go | 
 "words": I just purchased my TSX a few weeks ago and couldn't be happier | I test drove and compared the G35 Maxima IS250 | I did a ton of research and the longer I've had the car the happier I am with the purchase | I got it loaded with most accessories | the others were much more expensive and lacked comparable features | If you're in the market for a small four-door sedan you won't go wrong with the TSX | 
 "words": Some ask why I just didn't buy an Accord | it would've been cheaper | After 4000 miles now in my TSX I can tell them the TSX is definitely worth the extra few grand over the Accord | The ride is better the materials and fit and finish is a notch above that of the Accord | And the Accord is just a little bit too big for me | Looked at competing products from Lexus Audi BMW etc | and the TSX cannot be beaten in terms of value | Load up the others with the same options as in the TSX and you can expect to pay much more |

 "words": Just picked my new '09 TSX Polished Metal Black on Monday | So far it's been nothing but fun fun fun to drive | The Bluetooth is an amazing feature | The base model comes pretty loaded up with the exception of a CD changer and the navigation system but really why spend the extra 3000 or so on the navigation system when you can just go to Wal-Mart or Target and buy one for around 200 | Anyway I'm glad I got the car | It was between this or the '08 Accord and even though the dashboards are very similar the exterior design was the deciding factor for me | It looks great |

 "words": I decided on the TSX after test driving and pricing all the cars in its class | The TSX was the best bang for the buck bar none | My only complaint is the front grill of the car | Which can be easily fixed with some aftermarket tuning this is why Hondas are GREAT | The steering is fine the power is fine and the interior was probably the best | A lot of people are dinging this car but what do they expect | They want Acura to give them the power of a g35 is350 at a fraction of the cost | Get real | For what i paid for this car i'd be lucky to get a base is250 328i and what fun would that be | 
 "words": I had an '07 TSX and I regret trading it in for the the '09 | The redesigned interior turns out to be a mess compared to the well organized cabin of the '07 | It seems like Acura wanted the '09 to be more like a Beemer or Benz but couldn't deliver a the lower price point | 
 "words": I forgot how a top of the line affordable car is | The car is flawless sips gas and rides firm but solid and handles like the sport sedan that it is | I live in the worst state of the union Louisiana for bumpy roads | This car eats up the bumps and returns 26 city and 34 hwy | I am a big guy six foot two and 260 pounds | I have space to spare | Seat is very comfortable for short and long trips | My bluetooth works well and the voice system was easy to learn | 
 "words": Most things are fantastic | The ride is good but brake stopping distance is a bit much for a mid-sized 4 cyl | Fuel mileage is excellent I am getting 26 34 overall | Stereo system is good but I prefer to listen to my music and not be bathed in it | The CD changer functions well but takes up too much interior space | The cup-holders in the door sills are crappy make sure you keep your bottle top | The storage box next to gear shift deserves a coin holder Honda's have them | The other holders could not hold more than a couple of tokens | The car needs rear heat AC | I was going to get a TL at first but glad I did not because I could keep 10K extra | Overall an excellent value for the money | 
 "words": Wanted a car with a bit better gas mileage than my 2008 BMW 535i the TSX is the best car I could find when taking into account gas performance style quality and price | Overall I'm amazed at how much power this little 4 cyl gets | Acura has done a great job on interior quality | Car is fun to drive | The tech package is a must | 
 "words": I recently traded my 04 TL for the 09 TSX and I am not yet convinced I made the right choice | I chose the new TSX because the new body style somewhat resembled my old TL which I absolutely loved | Also the TSX had great gas mileage and the price with lots of accessories was unbeatable | HoweverI miss the power of my old car | The TSX takes a bit longer to get going after you accelerate | The ride is not as smooth as my other Acura | Also although the design is much bigger it still lacks leg room in the back seat | The old TLs still had more room | All being said I do love the look of the new TSX and I am sure I will enjoy it more as the time passes | Saving on gas alone is a big plus | 
 "words": We purchased our new TSX a few days ago and love it so far | Got the base model without the technology package which I felt was not worth 3000 | I personally feel this car looks best in a dark color so we went with crystal black pearl with parchment interior | I traded a Nissan Altima for this car which had been reliable but I never liked the look or size of the car | The TSX reminds me of the BMW 325i that I previously owned with regards to handling and interior comfort | 
 "words": I changed my mind a day before to purchase an 09 Accord EXL V6 | I made a great deal on both vehicles | I only had to pay 1000 more to get a TSX | The new V6 Accord engine is new in the market with the 3 4 6 cylinder running mode | Didn't like that | Didn't know the TSX is in my price range | TSX was quieter than Accord | Better suspension better material leather comes with HID and better interior | With only 1000 difference I'm going for the TSX | The engine is slightly noisier than my 08 TL but 4 cyl | is expected to do that | 
 "words": This is a outstanding car | The interior quality is refined and conveys quality | Nav is easy to use and the gauges are cool looking | The ELS sound system is truly fantastic | The car has plenty of power for Its size and when I tell people it's only a 4 cyl | They can't believe it | I personally love the new exterior look | It looks aggressive but classy | The steering is not as bad as some reviews have stated and really you would need to be on a track to notice any difference | I will admit the ride can be a bit stiff so if you are looking for a cushy ride this may not be the car for you | This car has an outstanding value compared to BMW and Audi | A Acura love this car
 "words": We absolutely love our TSX | So far we have had no problems out of it | We decided to just get the Base w auto model | Mainly because we didn't want to spend an extra 3000 on a navigation system where as you can get a portable one for 200 at many stores | We have had it for a little over 3 months and it already has over 3000 miles on it | One thing I do wish is that we would have waited and looked at the new TLs | Another thing is that I wish it would have is an inside fuel door release instead of having to have to push it on the outside | 
 "words": I purchased the 09 TSX as a 2nd vehicle keeping my Toyota truck because you always need a good truck around the house | The TSX is feature rich in interior technology is well built looks pretty good and performs well enough plus I'm getting about 26 mpg combined | It's not the best entry level sport sedan out there nor the most luxurious | However this 09 TSX gives you a good little mix of everything at a decent price cool technology basic sportiness touch of luxury great build quality nice redesigned looks great gas mileage | When all combined together it's a pretty good balance | Happy with the purchase so far especially when others around the same class cost more | 
 "words": Having owned this car for less than a week I can tell you it was a better choice than the other cars that I have researched VW CC Camry XLE Altima 2 | 5SL and Hybrid Maxima S | My goal was to find a car that was the best bang for a price range of 25-30k | In the end the TSX had the most features for your dollars as well as a luxury feel and quality | The only negative is the premium fuel requirement | The other thing I will need to get use to is the seating requires you to lean back more than I am use to comfortable feeling but different from the other cars | I hope to put in another review after a few months of use | 
 "words": I bought my new TSX over labor day trading in both a leased '05 RL and a Mazda 3 wagon | I was a hair's breadth away from buying a V6 Accord but decided to go for the extra bells and whistles of the TSX | Someone told me I'd just bought a 32000 iPod accessory which may have a grain of truth | While I think the car has plenty of power and I love the gas mileage the poor little engine thrashes and complains under even moderate load | I took it to the dealer complaining that the engine was knocking it was really that bad | but they said to just use Shell or Chevron premium | That didn't really help | I expected better from Honda |
