REVIEWS
 "words": Recently purchase XL model without any extras | Doesn't matter as it came with everything and more than I needed | I really like the clean center console | With the audio controls on the steering wheel I leave all the compartments closed for a clean sleek uncluttered look | We took our first trip with our new Avalon and averaged over 32 mpg at 75 mph | Just came out of a F150 so I really appreciate the gas mileage | Also recently had 5 adults in the car | My back seat passengers were amazed by the leg room | I also like the seats | They are not the sporty type with built up sides that you find in most cars today | Basically this is a Japanese Sedan DeVille | 
 "words": Beautiful car except it came with a front end vibration at 38-42 mph and above 60 mph | 5 trips to the dealer and 4000 miles later it has a reduced but constant vibration that is a nuisance at 39 mph and discomfort above 60 | The dealership replaced 2 tires and then all 4 with a harder tire | You feel every little imperfection in the road and the vibration puts your backside to sleep | After a 250 mile trip I was exhausted | This car should be a dream to drive but unfortunately it's a bad dream | Filing for a replacement under FL lemon law | 
 "words": This is great car and value for the money | Comfortable overall quiet very fuel efficient | With some tweaks to the exterior design and interior layout could be the best car Toyota makes | 
 "words": I am disappointed in their flagship | It has lots of wind noise | The DRONE of the tires is very prevalent | The driving position is the worst | I'm 6 | 0 the seats are uncomfortable and very hard | Not a lot of leg room for the driver | COMFORT and AVALON are never USED in the same sentence | This car is 95 Camry | A factory employee told me they don't want you to be satisfied | WHY | So they can sell you a Lexus | Transmission 2nd gear jerks every time it shifts it won't shift down when it needs too | The factory puts one coat on the bottom of the car for sound reduction rust | They started out putting 5 coats | It is all about saving at the consumer's expense | The car is reliable BUT | 
 "words": I paid 36000 for my 2009 Avalon | I will not drive it | It has 3000 miles on it | On 8 occasions the car has lurched forward after brakes were applied | One accident occurred costing me 500 deduct | I was in the bank line when the brakes failed | Car started moving forward | Brakes would not stop the car | Toyota dealers say they cannot find a problem | Both my husband and brother have experienced same problem driving this vehicle | Dealers say no other person has reported anything similar | The car is just too dangerous to drive | I am lucky I have not been injured or have injured someone else | 
 "words": Would love 2009 Avalon except for one major problem | At unexpected times after I brake the car begins to move forward | This has happened to 3 different drivers | I cannot stop this forward movement | It caused me to rear end another car at a band drive through | Toyota dealers will not acknowledge problem since they cannot duplicate problem | Car has 3000 miles on it and I am afraid to drive it | I have been told that I am the first person to report this in the U | S | I feel robbed | This is going to happen again | 
 "words": When shopping for our car we researched the purchase for a good year | We took into consideration our age our abilities and disabilities cost maintenance costs reliability etc | and came to the determination that this was the best car for us to purchase | The 8-way power seats both driver and passenger were a must for us and love the fact that both of us can maintain max comfort possible | When the wife's back is really hurting she wants to go on a road trip or just sit in the car to get it settled down | We get 26-28 MPG in town and up to 34 MPG on road trips | The Limited with AC in seats was hard on the wife's knee replacement but wasn't worth the cost to get laser cruise | 
 "words": The GPS is the worst | Extremely user unfriendly | Many important POI's are missing | Per Toyota many were removed to make more map space | Toyota admits that the Avalon has the original GPS designed for the 2003 model | No wonder it is antiquated | Toyota will not stand behind the device | Says it was designed to specs | I've asked them to take the vehicle back and replace it with another without GPS | They consistently refuse | Suggested guidance for the same route varies | Guidance for one route sometimes goes 15 miles out of the way | 
 "words": This car should be getting more attention by industry pundits | My 09 Avalon is a lot more car than I ever expected | The standard options are generous for a car costing under 34K | The ride and handling is responsive and not at all Buick like | The Avalon V6 with the 6 speed transmission is quick and the tap shift adds a bit of fun | Why buy a small hybrid when you can drive a large luxury sedan with 30 MPG | 
 "words": 4 adults w trunk FULL of luggage on a 1700 mile road trip and got 31 mpg in comfort | The 2000 navigation system is awful | My 300 portable Garmin is MUCH better | I complained to the dealer who said That's a common complaint | Toyota hasn't replied to my complaint letter | I want them to take the GPS out and give me my 2k back | 
 "words": The vehicle is smooth once you get cruising at about 60mph | However staring from a start there is a hesitation which causes you to almost lunge forward | The roof molding has loosened and almost come off | The transmission is sloppy and flops around both up and down as you accel and decel | The electronics is from the year 2000 | And the GPS is the worst that there is | The GPS is very outdated and has very limited POI's | The voice command is a joke and now the GPS has started locking up on me | I am waiting for the dealer to get back to me on that | The stereo unit in the car is just average | This is not the car I bargained for at all | After 4 months of driving it I am sorry I bought it | 
 "words": I first got into Toyota in my 2000 Avalon XLS | Then my 2003 Avalon XLS | In Oct | 07 I bought a 08 Camry SE | I just traded it for my 09 Avalon Limited | I would ask why buy a bottom end Lexus this high end Avalon is perfect | The room in it is exceptional and it has all the comfort features you could want from a luxury car | The price points of Toyota are exceptional and have better negotiations than Lexus by far | Toyota warranties are not as good as Lexus but then they don't break either | Toyota thank you for making such a GR8 car | I love it | 
 "words": We love our new Avalon | Bought a loaded Limited without navigation or the optional cruise feature | Moved from a mini-van to a car with a lot of research before buying | Some main concerns had been ease of getting in and out of a car and also if there would be enough leg and head room for several 6'4 adults | We love the ride and comfort | Plenty of room for those long legs | I have some back problems but these seats fit me just right so no problems | Driving our gravel winter roads on snow ice slush gets us 26-27 mpg | Like the vehicle stability control feature | Driving on a vacation in the sunny south got us 32-35 mpg | Had the car 4 months and close to 10000 miles already | 
 "words": I have driven Avalons since 1996 | I have owned the 1997 2001200320052006 and now the 2009 | This is by far the best Avalon of the bunch | It is the most refined the best handling and the most comfortable | My car is loaded with everything but the remote starter | I noticed that handling on back winding country roads is much improved over my 2006 and I have more road feel | I happen to be a car nut and an Older Gentleman and this vehicle fills all of my current automotive desires | Of course I do not expect it to be a racing machine and know what to expect since I have driven Porches Maseratis and Citroens | Bottom Line this is the best Avalon yet | 
 "words": This is my third Avalon | I am still getting used to it but overall I really like it | It has a great ride and is very quiet | The only thing I do not like is the hardness of the drivers seat | I can feel something under the padding perhaps it has something to do with the seat's cooling feature | I have been driving around for the last 4 months with a thin quilt under me | This makes it more comfortable | Hopefully the seats will break in and I can take out the quilt | Other than that I really love it | 
 "words": I purchased the Avalon Limited edition in mid January 2009 | After driving around town and on an extended trip I have to say that the Avalon is probably the smoothest driving car I have ever driven | For the size comfort and ride I am very happy | This is a great car for long trip freeway driving | 
 "words": Just got the Toyota Avalon limited with cooled seats | There is a design flaw in the seats as they are very uncomfortable with the cooling bars under the padding | I noticed it the next day while driving | Service made an adjustment but not enough and both sales and service agree that there is a problem | However it seems to be a design of the seats | I consider it a flaw I am now contacting Toyota to see what can be done about it | The service tech told me Lexus uses the same system but the seats have more padding | I would try out the driver seat for an extended time before purchasing one that has a cooling option for the seats | I wouldn't buy it again because of it | 
 "words": Our 05 Avalon Ltd was totaled with 50200 miles | Was a great car and wife wanted a new on just like it and dealer found one that at my request excluded the nav and laser speed control | These were features we had on the 05 that we didn't really like | With 1000 miles so far the 09 is quieter | The 6 speed auto is smooth and the already good fuel economy is even better | The 05 could attain 32 highway and on our first road trip with only 300 miles on the car added 240 more miles on the trip we got 33 | 9 mpg generally driving 70 mph | I also think the front end is now better looking particularly the fog lights |
