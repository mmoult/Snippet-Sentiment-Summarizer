 "words": One year and 17000 miles ago I bought my '09 CTS | What a phenomenal car | Fun to drive not a single problem and still a head turner | Highway mileage has averaged 26 29 mpg on road trips using regular gas | Truly a terrific car | The AWD was outstanding throughout last year's Chicago winter | The car is still tight as the day I bought it | The 304 hp engine is quick and powerful with a deep growl when you jump on it | My previous car was a Lexus ES 330 and before that an Acura TL | Without question this is a much more fun to drive and stylish car with the same reliability and quality of the competition | Would I buy this car again | without hesitation | 
 "words": Given all of the incentives to purchase a new car I decided to replace my '02 V6 Honda Accord EX a fine car that I found to be extremely boring | When I read the reviews of the new CTS I was impressed | When I drove the car I was even more so | Now after 9K miles I am comfortable in saying that it is everything I expected it to be | It is truly a world-class car and GM Cadillac should be justifiably proud | They have produced a distinctively American entry level luxury sedan with performance style and quality | There is no reason to add the phrase for an American car when comparing it to Euro or Japanese competitors | It's vehicles like the CTS that are critical to GM's recovery | 
 "words": Expect this from your dealer and cadillac | If your automatic tranny fails like ours cadillac will have you wait two weeks for the parts and a failed attempt to rebuild your transmission at least twice before they deem it appropriate to replace the transmission | Our new CTS spent 20 days of the first 29 days of ownership in the shop | As a valued Cadillac owner you'll spend dollars for nickel and dime service | The new GM is just as bad as the old GM or worse | No matter how great the car looks or drives you won't enjoy ownership if you're treated like this | I do have regrets about buying a Cadillac | Chances are you will too | Shame on you Cadillac | 
 "words": When I decided to buy a car I wanted to stay domestic | I did look at the foreign models but the only thing that stood out for me was BMW | I have owned GM before and have been overall impressed with their designs and comfort | What originally lured me in was the promise of excellence in design and my parents being Cadillac owners but I was sold at first test drive | Love the car love everything about it | I'm afraid that between the customer service from Corporate Cadillac and the quality of the vehicle I am now a Cadillac owner for life | Oh | FYI | I have read reviews about road noise | three words sport-tuned- suspension | go back to that Lexus if you don't like it | 
 "words": I must say that so far it has been a mostly pleasant experience | I have the red CTS and it does draw it share of raves from family and strangers | One draw back I noticed immediately was the width of the A pillars in conjunction with the side view mirrors makes for a sizable blind spot | Backing the car up is a bit of a guessing game since you can't see the rear deck | You can't count on the computer to give accurate gas mileage readings | On the instant readout the mileage jumps all over the place including into the 40 mpg range | The average MPG was showing 30 | 2 at 65 MPH without the AC on | If it was really getting that kind of mileage I think it would have been show on the EPA estimate | 
 "words": With the automotive world giving such panegyrical reviews to this car I figured it surely must be a ploy to get us to stimulate the economy and buy American | Prior to my '09 CTS I owned a 2008 Acura TL Type-S that was my absolute favorite car | However I drove the CTS and it was all over | My 3 | 6 DI AWD is a real driver's car | it gives great feedback to the driver corners like it's on rails the brakes are phenomenal and it has admirable throttle response | Not to mention great style | Overall build quality is great no complaints in the first 7000 miles | I would recommend that anyone in the market check out the CTS among the typical mix of imports you'll be pleasantly surprised | 
 "words": Overall I really love this car and I am picky | The steering feel ride and all the features for the price are hard to beat | On top of that Caddy has a signature style with this car that sets it apart in looks and handling | That said there are still some quality issues they need to address | There were some paint issues underspray a shaky side mirror and creaks | Nothing too bad but these things should not take place on any car of this class | I would tell anyone to check out CTS before buying an import | This car has it all |

 "words": I love everything about the car except for the gas mileage which isn't any better than the 2000 Sedan De ville I traded in for it | The storage spaces doors glove box center console trunk etc | are also quite small for the size of car | I got the blue diamond tricoat which is absolutely beautiful | The On-Star and cell phone service is cool and the stereo system is awesome | It handles beautifully and has plenty of smooth power |
