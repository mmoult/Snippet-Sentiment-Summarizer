REVIEWS
 "words": This is a dream carThe price is extremely low for a great performing automobile | My only complaint is lack of radio | I think this is a game to increase price | I ordered a Sony CD radio for a total price 151 | 24 | Will pay 40-50 installation | Versa comes prewired except a radio | Ebay tell me of 200 | 00 saving over Nissan's radios | 
 "words": My Ford Taurus died on me and I was shopping around for a midsized sedan with good gas mileage | I researched and test drove a Versa Corolla Elantra and Spectra | Although I could get in an Elantra and Spectra for a bit cheaper I went with the Versa because we liked it so much after test drive | Much better leg room in the rear compared to the other cars and a very comfy ride | The Versa handles very well is fun to drive and looks quite sporty mine is red | We really like the extra features of the SL model since we have 2 small boys | So far I've gotten excellent MPG | I also qualified for a green loan from my Credit Union due to the combined MPG of the Versa being over 29 MPG | 
 "words": I bought my versa for the most part for the price and also the room | I am 6'3 tall and it is difficult to find a comfortable small car | The Versa fits the bill | We liked the Versa so much that three months later we purchased another this time the HB | Love them both | If you have the extra money- spring for the power option my 1 | 6 has only A C and it is very inconvenient to have no power locks or windows although a small price to pay for such a solid built fuel efficient comfortable car at that price | 
 "words": traded a 2002 elantra with 160k and wanted another one but the hyundia dealer wasn't moving on the price | Stumbled on to the Versa and got a great deal | Excellent on gas and comfortable too | 
 "words": Traded in my old 1995 Nissan 4X4 king cab for the 2009 Versa 1 | 6 L sedan with ABS and AC cash for clunkers The Versa is very comfortable quiet and very peppy on the road | Happy to have the AC and the ABS no radio though | I got 400 miles on the 13 | 2 gallon fuel tank not too shabby and that is with the AC on and in a lot of stop and go traffic | Looked at the Yaris but it was more expensive and not as comfortable or quiet and considerably less roomy | The Honda Fit was also less comfortable and less roomy plus more expensive | The Versa may not be flashy looking but it covers all the bases and then some | 
 "words": I have only owned this car for 2 months but I am extremely happy with it | I am 6' 4 and fit in it just fine | This site really helped in my decision to purchase it | I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a good fun car at a fair price | 
 "words": I have to admit I cried when my husband traded in our 02 VW Beetle for this car | This is my first Nissan and I am VERY impressed by the quality of this car | The ride is smooth and quiet plenty of head and leg room for everyone to fit comfortably and amenities galore you would not expect to find on such a well priced car 18400 | We have close to 8K miles on our SL Versa | The gas mileage went from OK 27 mpg to GREAT 32 as it becomes more broken in | We have every option imaginable sunroof bluetooth remote keyless entry ignition cruise CVT stero upgrade with AUX port steering controls power everything sporty body kit upgrade and no problem with any of it | 
 "words": Brand new 2009 Nissan Versa 1 | 6L 5spd Sedan | Miles per gallons is underrated | With a combination of freeway and city street driving we are getting over 40 miles per gallon as an average | 400miles with only 10 gallons of gas | So on the highway the mileage is probably well over 40mpg | This 1 | 6L sips gas even with the A C on | Not only that but this 1 | 6L engine accelerates pretty well for it's size | Is surprisingly roomy for it's size as well | Fits 4 adults comfortably | Handles well very much like a VW Golf or similar | Quiet engine and quiet ride | 
 "words": I got the Versa Sedan 1 | 6 with 5 speed manual transmission and A C with ABS through the Cash for Clunkers program | I wanted the least expensive car out there that had A C and that an adult could fit into | I've owned Nissan's before and I know they make a better product | This car is made for practical adults | It has plenty of safety features and a lot of interior room | The truck is very roomy for vacation travel | For the kid in me I do enjoy winding it up and going through the gears | It isn't a speed demon but I can get through traffic with ease if I'm running late | 
 "words": My Wife and I bought a Nissan as our first car in 1983 | It was a Stanza and was a horrible car | We never considered Nissan again until I found this Nissan Versa | I wanted a fun car for errands and commuting and the Fit and Yaris were too small | We looked at used cars but found that a new 2009 Versa was actually a better deal than a used car | I love the way it rides it holds my carpoolers well the standard radio CD player is great it is peppy and holds plenty of groceries in the hatch | While in this car I am 57 years young taking me back to my college days | My Wife wanted black and frankly speaking it looks as expensive as an Audi or similar small expensive car | 
 "words": I am absolutely in love with my Versa | Previously drove another Nissan and so was interested in buying another one | As a first time buyer did a lot of research on cars and found this to be the best | Initially I wasn't interested in a hatchback but this has more of a sporty look and that old timey station wagon feel | Comfortable car features great and good for road trips | As a recent graduate the price was extremely affordable | I would pick this car again and again if I had to do it over | 
 "words": I am seventeen years old and this car was given to me as a gift from my father | I use it to drive to school and to my friends houses everyday | I find its comfortable and all my friends like that the interior is quite spacious | I drive this car allot and have found that while it is great to drive alone as soon as the car fills up with over four people the performance begins to decrease extensively with the added weight to the point where driving becomes a big challenge | This car has two main flaws | One is the clunky gearbox which makes shifting into gear an uncomfortable chore and the other is the pathetic braking ability | Stopping distances are dangerously long without ABS | 
 "words": Ok so I've only had it a week but it's been a great week | I drove everything before deciding on the Versa it was the best equipped for the and has a solid feel not like that tin can little car feel you'd expect | If you're buying spring for the SL with CVT great mpg and surprising zip factor | Got 29mpg on first tank | Also surprising the roominess in the cabin | No cramped legs no bumped heads | LOTS of storage | Parking is a breeze | Great price great incentives great warranty | I drive a LOT and am very happy and expecting only to grow happier with my choice | Getting lots of compliments too | from cool car | to adorable | to wow | this is my second Nissan won't be last | 
 "words": I have been looking at autos of this style for the past month | I've tested the Toyota Yaris Chevy Aveo Honda Fit Kia Rio5 and the Hundai Elantra Touring | Some of them were a bit sportier in style and performance but mostly less than the Nissan | Roominess was and is a hands down to the Nissan | I absolutely despised the instrument layout in the Toyota I guess that I don't like having to look over for the speedo etc | Price was also a factor with the Nissan hitting the right tone | For those who haven't driven the Chevy Aveo be cautioned if you have to make a left turn and even see oncoming traffic you will be better off to get out and push than to use the accelerator | So far very Happy | 
 "words": This is a great car | Classified as a sub-compact but feels much bigger | More front seat room than my friend's prius | I am a big person | sits high which makes it easy to get in and out of | First tank's mileage27 mpg in mixed driving including a Major multi-mile summer beach traffic jam | 
 "words": We already have a car payment so we decided to get just the basic Versa with only air condition and auto transmission add-ons | When it comes to Nissan's 'basic' be careful because there are a few things we didn't notice until after buying the car | No way to adjust the side mirrors from inside no clock and the thing that we were most disappointed about is there is no key hole on the passenger side | You can't unlock the door from the passenger side | What if someone parked so close to your driver's door that you couldn't get in | Well then your out of luck because there's no other way to get in the car | 
 "words": I am at 9000 miles at just 6 months | so you know I am driving this car | I drive 42 miles round trip to work and take trips when I can | I love this car | It is 90 degrees now and I am comfortable with the air | I have only driven it on setting three once or twice | I usually drive with it on the first setting after letting the hot air out | I have moved an office in it so I know it has plenty of space | It is very comfortable for anyone sitting in the back | I drove 211 miles at 85 miles without stopping and got good gas mileage and made really great time | This will get you where you want to go | It might not be the fanciest car out there but for the price | It is hard to beat | Artic Blue my fav | 
 "words": After looking at the Versa Basic BaseA C with Auto trans and ABS and nothing else not even a radio with MSRP of 12965 my wife and I decided to purchase the 158xx 'S' model because it included a very nice 1250 rebate AND had a higher markup between invoice and MSRP which allowed us to get a better deal | We wound up spending 1200 to get the upgraded interior the upgraded engine power locks windows doors keyless entry stereo floor mats cruise controland alloy wheels | Basically 3000 worth of features for 1200 | We love the car and wound up paying 14200 at carmax | With the CARS program we got 4650 for our 1985 dodge and the Versa S only cost us 9550 | 
 "words": I bought my 2009 Nissan Versa SL in May 09 to replace 07 Santa Fe truck | I was looking for a more fuel economy car | The car has about 1600 miles now | I notice the the steering wheel pulsates as you brake and come to a complete stop don't know if there something wrong with the ABS | I also have a problem starting the car with long crank or multiple crank | I have an appointment for this weekend so hopefully they can address these two issues | MGP not as good as advertise or other people are getting here | It could be due to the fuel pressure regulator | 
 "words": Have just had the S Hatchback for a week and just filled up yesterday | 250 city miles on initial tank | Now I am OCDing about not getting the SL because I am regretting not having the CVT for the many hills on my daily commute | I drove Hondas for 22 years lastly a 1995 Odyssey until 180000 miles | I guess I miss the heaviness of that van and the fact that it seemed to downshift on hills requiring less braking | This Versa S if fine except when going down winding hills until I get used to the difference | Any suggestions | I am trying to shift into 2nd gear upon descent and that helps decrease the need to brake as much | Will I get over not having the CVT | Everyone loves the roominess | 
 "words": I bought the 1 | 6 base model | My out of pocket was 5400 dollars Tax after the cash for clunkers deal | It is nice not to have a loan to worry about and have a 3 year warranty | That is my biggest rave about this car | I drive about 2 miles to work and back as well as running errands around town | So far this car is doing what I expect it to do | It handles well in the city has good pick up | It is very utilitarian which is exactly what I wanted | Great commuter car so far I am looking for a very low total cost of ownership | Basically I drove my last car for free and I hope I can do the same for this one | 
 "words": Bought this yesterday with my Clunker's trade-in incentive of 4500 | It also carries a manufacturer rebate of 1750 for SL totaling a saving of 6250 | Its' hard to beat that | In order to maximize my Clunker's incentive I needed a car that has 28 mpg or better | It's hard to find one without going hybrids which can easily cost over 20K | This one fits my bill perfectly | Actually not all Versa have 28 mpg or better just the 1 | 6 engine or the 1 | 8 engine with CVT | Unfortunately with such saving programs in place the whole dealership was jammed with customers | I had to buy the car in pretty much MSRP price and with extras loaded | So far the car is fun to drive and handles well | 
 "words": This is my first new car | I have always bought older custom datsuns and other sports cars so my review may be different | I bought a 09 versa base for the rain and winter but wound up putting custom rims and a few other goodies on it | Being nissans official rally racing car you can feel the agility | Great performance for 9990 | I know I drive fast cars | I didnt expect this versa to handle this well out of the box | It has the usual chinsey plastic inside for a low cost Nissan but otherwise great car | Amazing room | Fun to drive | Great on gas | 
 "words": I have had the Versa for about 4 months | I would not buy another one | This car has been back to the dealer several times to fix small problems | It has several flaws that are important to me | One the AC is undersized for Florida when out in the heat you need to put the air flow to recycle to keep the cabin cool | Although the noise level when running is the lowest of the other cars I test drove | it is the loudest car I ever be in when you accelerate | Last but not least | The driver | s side window wiper is about twice the size of the passenger side and it throws its water on to the passenger side | Thus in the rain the passenger side is never clear | 
 "words": My '09 Versa 1 | 8S HB 6-speed stick is almost a year old and I am quite happy with it | I've had oil changes and the whole car checked over every 3750 miles per Nissan's advice | MPG isn't what I'd hoped my former car a Dodge Neon with a larger engine and an automatic got 30 mpg I am getting mid-twenties in town and low thirties on the highway | Which isn't bad anyway right | I put new custom rims on black other than that the car is stock | I am waiting on a part from Nissan to fix the plastic shroud around the battery which inexplicably tore loose somehow | I have had no mechanical issues such as some of those reported here | Once the tach hits 3000 rpm watch out the car takes off | 
 "words": 1500 miles to be exact just arrived from vegas for a break-in trip for my versa SL HB I'm enjoying the ride | No problems so far | Lovin' my ride | 
 "words": Have 4000 miles on barebones manual locks windows 6 speed hatchback | AC is strong enough for Florida summer | Quick enough for highway merging | Comfortable seating front and rear | Very good visibility this and crash rating were seller for me | Paid 13500 out the door including tags and taxes | Also included dealer installed cruise control | Only negative is that 1st gear is sometimes hard to find | Have driven sticks for last 20 years and have never had this problem before | Wife feels gearing is too short between gears as well | OVERALL happy with purchase but would have liked ABS | bundling would increase price by 2000 | 
 "words": I purchase this car new in Oct of '08 as a '09 model | A week after I bought the car the car started to have a long crank | There were times that it would not start on the first try | I took it to the dealer and they replaced the 'Fuel Pressure Regulator' | Now the car has 22500 miles | I do drive far for work | So far everything has been alright | I am averaging 31MPG on this car | It starting to have the 'long crank problem' again for the third time | I will be taking my car in for the third time for the same issue | This is getting annoying | Good car but i would not buy another Versa | 
 "words": It's an excelent car has quality and performance | It holds pretty much everything our family needs | 
 "words": I just love my versa | What a fun car to drive | Averaging 26mpg less than advertised 40mpg but still am satisfied | Very comfortable even on long trips | Ample room in the trunk area and I'm always loading it up with Costco bulk purchases | Two repair problems so far and I'm still under 2000 miles | Driver door lock would not unlock manually and I needed a new fuel pump after experiencing difficulty starting the vehicle | I've read on a number of forums that this is a problem for many however Nissan has not issued a recall just a service bulletin | Despite this I just love the car and would recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": I grabbed this 1 | 6 because I needed a car and didn't want a used one | I have never gotten less then 34mpg mixed driving | It's way better then the EPA rated | The car costs very little insurance is hardly nothing and it's so roomy | 
 "words": I bought my 2009 Nissan Versa SL about 6 months ago | About a month after purchase the AC starting making loud rattling noises | Brought it to the dealership to be fixed with no success | Had to argue with the dealer just to get them to even look at the car again and 2 months later and after 2 more drop-offs that problem appears to be solved by replacing the entire AC system | A few weeks after this incident the car starts having trouble turning over | The dealer replaces the Fuel Pump Regulator which solves the problem for about 6 weeks | Today the car is back in the shop with the same issue again | Already considering getting rid of it despite the loss I would take | NOT RECOMMENDED | 
 "words": I bought my SL hatch 2 months ago see New Versa Yesterday and so far I have no cause for complaint | It averages 32-33mpg mostly highway driving | Definitely spring for the SL if you can | 
 "words": Bought this car new after 637 miles car engine started knocking | High winding transmission noises | Been in the shop for 28 days serviced 4 times | Changed 6 different parts then they had to install a new engine | New engine still knocks Nissan will no longer honor warranty with only 13000 miles | So am in Arbitration w BBB AUTOLINE | Hopefully this will get resolved | Other than all that car is cute economic about 27-33mph | 
 "words": I test drove the honda fit and the scion xd and I chose the versa mainly because of the roomy interior and the price | Definitely worth the upgrade to the SL the S and base versions don't have as nice interior armrestupholstery ipod | This car is perfect for my commute and it's fun to zip around the city in | It's comfortable to drive and isn't goofy looking like the scion or the fit | It gets good gas mileage handles well and drives fine on the freeway and in the city | I've read reviews where they say it's a snooze to drive but I disagree | It's got the ipod jack and cruise control and it feels like you are in a much larger car | My family and friends can all ride comfortably in it | 
 "words":  Did tons of research on compacts out today | All have pro's and con's | Most important in the end was safety ratings then price | The Versa fit my bill the best and is a really nice ride for the money | Unfortunately the car only came with automatic tranny AC and floormats as options but dealer hooked me up with splash guards | As for the lack of radio I just went on ebay and got a factory versa radio for 50 buck | Car then was complete and I was totally happy | Interior is VERY roomy and comfortable | Power from engine is zippy but can be very buzzy when acelerating hard | Seen 28 to 40 mpgs so car is great fuel saver | Automatic tranny is not the smoothest I've driven | 
 "words":  Did tons of research on compacts out today | All have pro's and con's | Most important in the end was safety ratings then price | The Versa fit my bill the best and is a really nice ride for the money | Unfortunately the car only came with automatic tranny AC and floormats as options but dealer hooked me up with splash guards | As for the lack of radio I just went on ebay and got a factory versa radio for 50 buck | Car then was complete and I was totally happy | Interior is VERY roomy and comfortable | Power from engine is zippy but can be very buzzy when acelerating hard | Seen 28 to 40 mpgs so car is great fuel saver | Automatic tranny is not the smoothest I've driven | 
 "words": What is there not to say | I love this Car | It feels like a large car but with a sub-compact price | I got mine loaded minus the sport package | I am 6'0 tall and have plenty of room | It keeps up well on the interstate | Car is small but safe | 
 "words": I bought this car last December | I have a blue 1 | 6 sedan manual transmission | AC ABS | That is all you need | In this consumer oriented society we have gotten used to wasting money | well I commute every day 37 miles each way | in city traffic | My Versa just turned 3K and my fuel average is 40 mpg | so on a cost per mile basis this is as good as it gets | sure I had to spend 200 bucks to install a nice CD HD radio but the car already came with 4 speakers and antenna pre-wired | So far the car has been absolutely trouble free | yes I have to exercise my arm just a bit to manually lower the window at drive thru's and garage gates | and I had to manually adjust my side view mirror
 "words": I bought my Versa yesterday so cannot speak on its reliability and build yet | I drove both the S and SL versa hatch | The S was a smooth quiet ride with lots of room power and comfort | No trouble getting up hills and good acceleration | The SL improved with the CVT and extra options but the S would have done the job fine | 
 "words": Driving a 2000 Sable last summer when gasoline hit 4 gallon made me swear to replace it with a fuel-efficient car when it died | Now I am two weeks into owning this car and can report that the MPG is wondrous I drove nearly 400 miles on the first tank of gas | The 5- speed stick makes for a ton of fun although the car gets noticeably buzzy above 70 mph and 5th doesn't feel like it should be the last upshift | This is not a problem around town where the car zips around like Yorkshire terrier hunting for mice but I can't say I'm looking forward to interstate driving at high speed with this car | But what most owners say is true This car feels a lot larger than it is | 
 "words": I've had this car for about six months and I'm already tired of it | I previously owned an 06 Hyundai Sonata that I adored until I totaled it | The Versa gets great gas mileage and I trust the Nissan name | However it has depreciated 6000 already | I expected a small foreign-made car to retain its value today but I was sadly mistaken | I have cruise control and ABS options | I'm mostly disappointed at the high price I'll be paying off for several years for a tiny basic car | It is absolutely frightening to drive this car in the snow ice or even high-wind I was actually blown off the road once | There is poor get-up when compared to my Sonata and poor storage up front lacks a console | 
 "words": My wife loves the fact that when she drives around in her Versa everyone looks at her and smiles | It's not a common car around here but she picked it out because she thought it was the cutest | Inside it feels like a larger car | We got a sunroof the only car in its class that had one as an option and like the way it handles | CVT is smooth with lots of power and pep | With only 500 miles on the engine got 32 MPG on highway 27 MPG on Vermont back roads | 
 "words":  I bought my Versa at the end of September 2008 | I love everything about it | I've had only one problem a faulty gas cap causing the check engine light to come on and I have only two things I could complain about | 1 I would like a lock that can be opened with the key on the hatch door and 2 the heater defroster seems to take longer to warm up than any other car I've owned | Item 1 could probably be solved by having power locks but I didn't want them so I have to unlock the driver's door to unlock the hatch | I also disagree with reviews complaining of a lack of performance | I can't keep this car at the speed limit | I have a manual transmission so that may the difference | Buy one these | 
 "words": The 2009 Nissan 1 | 8 SL Hatchback was not even in my radar when I started doing my research for a new car | 48 hours after test driving one though I ordered it with all the available packages | This car is very fun to drive and has enough zip to not disappoint | CVT makes the ride so much smoother and quieter than the 2009 Honda Fit I test drove both cars back to back on the same day | Edmunds | com may think it's a plain car but I love it | Nothing complicated | just sound Nissan engineering | 
 "words": The Versa is a Renault design | Going all the way back to the Renault Dauphine they are the only small cars I have ever seen with no front wheel well incursion into the passenger cabin | Not only can a tall driver stretch out you also have lots of leg room side to side | It feels as comfortable and spacious as a Cadillac to me | As I often rent cars to tour Europe I am accustomed to the style and it is not goofy to me | It is actually something distinctive | As the French invented front drive and have been making quality small cars for 50 years I was ready for some Franco style and design in a Nissan package | 
 "words": This is my first new car it has been driven for a year and I am considering trading it in | For a buyer that was supposedly making an upgrade from a 295000 mile 1991 Toyota Previa I am truly disappointed | The car has been in the shop for major repairs like a malfunctioning A C condenser and braking problems | I never had such problems with my Previa | The engine knocks pretty loud in the mornings too | Needless to say this was one of the worst cars I've bought and I cant get rid of it because the resale value on the Nissan Versa and Nissan Sentra drop like a stone once you drive them off the lot
 "words": The Versa is by far the best sub-compact on the road | Seats are thick and supportive and handling is great | Back seats don't lay as flat as the fit but are much more comfortable and tons more leg room head room | Cool features like bluetooth and I-key | Good price | 
 "words": I think it looks fantastic | I like the faceted look at the edges of the trunk and hood | Anyway form should follow function and this car is very functional it has more back seat leg room than many much larger and more expensive cars | It also has one of the largest trunks sedan in it's class | I think it's great fun to drive | If you want the best combination of low price good gas mileage large interior and trunk room I think the Versa 1 | 6 wins hands down | Just put in a radio CD and go it already has 4 spkrs | 
 "words": I got a Nissan Versa 09 in Aug 08 | I love my car | I have purchased 4 cars in the past 10 years and was looking for that perfect fit | 
 "words": This is a cute car but I do not understand why Nissan does not make the aux port on the radio for mp3 players standard on all vehicles especially the Versa which is priced for the younger crowd | The standard radio has a six CD changer but who listens to CDs anymore | Seriously | Also there is no armrest in the center for the right arm which is mildly annoying and there are no map lights which is pretty dumb | I'm not looking for luxury but it would be nice if Nissan would be ahead of the curve on the cultural zeitgeist | Other vehicles in this category come with the aux port standard | When I asked how to upgrade the radio they said I couldn't do it | 
 "words": Got best gas miles on a trip to casino | Oct 30 2008 188 divided by 8 | 3 22 | 6 259 | 9 per gallon 00188 Nov 11 2008 133 divided by 5 | 7 23 | 3 2 | 35 per gallon 00322 After trip to casino using cruise control first time above 45 mph Nov 11 2008 133 | 4 divided 3 | 2 41 | 6 Wow | no hills | 00456 Still driving easy for the first 1000 miles | 
 "words": For its price this car is undeniably a great deal | The hatchback is sporty in appearance the interior is incredibly spacious for its overall size and the interior is very well designed | While the car is considered a compact by class it doesn't feel so while driving as its 1 | 8 L engine has plenty of power for the car and the transmission has almost seamless smooth transitions | Overall this car is perfect for people who want a sporty commute to work and great fuel efficiency | 
 "words": We loved the car at first | Have had numerous mechanical issues sluggish cvt still a problem dealer indicated that we should change our 35 years of driving approach hard starting rpm to low at 40 mpg all 4 tires were defective and needed to be replaced | Service to fix was slow at best | Very disappointing | No follow up from Nissan after purchase regarding purchase experience and performance of the Versa | 
 "words": The car is comfortable peppy and quiet | Fun to drive | Very easy to clutch and shift | The back seat is very roomy more than you would expect | The pros rate it as just a blah so-so car | But they always compare it to another one that is 2-4 thousand more | It seems they do not have to listen to their bank account telling them a little compromise is OK | About the only thing you have to get used to is that on the highway doing 65-70 mph even in 6th gear the engine RPM are about 3K so you always think you still have to upshift | 
 "words": Steering wheel rattles everytime I enter exit driveways bumpy parking lots when turning left and right | I have this being checked since the first two months of my maintenance and no one could fix it | I think this is a factory defect parts | Services in 2 dealerships have failed my satisfaction already | I have email Nissan Canada nobody seems to care | So I from now on after that I could dispose this vehicle no more Nissan for me | That's it | I'd rather buy a bit higher priced car than with this brand | 
 "words": I just got my Versa 8 days ago and have already put over 900 miles on it | So far so good | I have always driven a truck or SUV and was very concerned about going to a smaller car | So far I like the Versa | It rides nice and has some nice features | The seats are comfortable and the car seems very quiet | I test drove 5 other cars in its class from other makers and the versa was by far the best one in its price range | 
 "words": Well I traded in my previous vehicle of 6 years a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 | Do I really need to say more here | I've only owned the car less than a week but this car is terrific | It's exactly what I was looking for | I was between this and the Honda Fit | The view from the Fit's drivers seat felt like you were too far back-it just felt uncomfortable | Anyway going from a vehicle with a mpg rating of 15 11 to 33 27 is certainly going to have an impact on my trips to the gas pump or lack there of not to mention how much less it will cost me per fill up | I'm very pleased with it's roominess and the 1 | 8L CVT engine has more pep than most people will think | Spend the extra for the SL if you can | 
 "words": Bought the Versa over the Toyota Matrix have one already because of standard features on the Versa | This Versa becomes the wifes car and I get the Matrix | I've had the Versa for one week now and have a little over 100 miles on the car all city driving | Gas gauge still on full | Car is very quiet and smooth running CVT is very nice and very quiet | No estimate of MPG yet but am hoping for at least the stated average at this point for city hwy driving | Great economical car thus far with many great features and good design and style | 
 "words": I have this car about a couple of weeks and I just love this car | I looked at Honda Fit and Toyota Yaris | I see these cars on Route 1 and they look too small for that kind of Highway | I wanted 1 | 8 L not 1 | 5 like Fit and Yaris | Interior is roomy and it feels like a big car | It's zippy and I am very comfortable on highways | 
 "words": After having owned a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Matrix I decided to give the Nissan Versa a try | So far I must say that initially I am impressed by the smoothness of the CVT and the get up and go of the 4 cyl eng | Overall the interior is nice but the front seat armrest is a total useless joke | It is not high enough or long enough to lay your arm on | Hope they fix that in upcoming models | Haven't it it long enough to evaluate the gas mileage but hopefully it will fulfill the commuter car requirements around town and the occasional out of town trip | Good little car for the money |
