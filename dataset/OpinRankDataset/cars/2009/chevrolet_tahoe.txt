REVIEWS
 "words": Our purchase of a new Chevy Yukon has been a major disappointment to me | My wife enjoys the size and ride but we have owned Suburbans for the past 20 years | The fuel mileage has been the biggest disappointment with mileage no better than 14mpg whether highway or in town | Our old Suburban got 17 18 on the road | Performance is also not what was expected | The engine has died in the middle of a turn and there seems to be a small miss when slowing for a turn and then accelerating | Unexpectedly thee is NO storage under the seats or anywhere | All in all for the money I think a Lexus BMW or MB may have been a better idea | 
 "words": Traded in a 2005 Suburban 3 4 ton 6 | 0L 4WD for a 2009 Tahoe LTZ 6 | 2L 4WD fully loaded black with black leather | Wow | What a difference in the ride | This Tahoe is very smooth especially with the 6-speed | I have owned a 2002 Tahoe Z71 and the 2009 LTZ is almost like driving a different truck | The 6 | 2L has fantastic performance | My gas mileage around town is 13-14 mpg and on the highway about 17-18 mpg | however my driving style does not place much priority on gas mileage | 
 "words": This 3rd Tahoe for us and is the nicest family car we have ever owned | Comfortable quiet and 19 to 20 miles per gallon using cruise control and driving in a sane manner | The fuel management system really helps with the gas | Runs on Regular | Easy to use controls | Memory seats | Dual zone heating and cooling | Both I and my wife are comfortable | 
 "words": I recently traded in a 1999 Chevy Tahoe LT for a new 2009 LTZ model | The much reduced pricing and 0 interest made this an easy decision | I am very happy with the new model and the significant improvement in ride quality and technical advances over the previous model I owned | The miles per gallon has improved by about 15 over the old model 16 mpg is achieved now with a 50 50 mix of highway and city driving | The bluetooth cell option automatically turns down the radio and ventilation noises to permit an easy conversation | It is easy to store telephone numbers and make cell calls over bluetooth | 
 "words": Time to get a new vehicle for towing | After looking for a long time GM Tahoe Yukon was only vehicle that could satisfy my fully loaded Astro replacement | PIck Tahoe for better looks | Nice smooth ride but feel the jolts over potholes | Maybe because of 20inch wheels | Avg 20 mpg from NY to Va | Tranny and rear end was thumping when starting to descend on downhill and letting go of gas | Dealer reprogram tranny module | Seems to fix problem | Door molding began slight peeling | Dealer replace like new | Otherwise really enjoy ride | I like my Garmin GPS better than GM GPS | Will use to tow boat on regular basis from NY to FL | Overall good SUV for people who need towing | Gets same mpg as my Astro | 
 "words": We started looking for an SUV and wasn't sure what direction to go | My father in-law has a Yukon SLT and loves it | I have always been anti American when it comes to vehicles I always stuck with Japanese | We also own a 07 Honda Pilot EX-Lw nav and absolutely love it however my wife wanted something more roomy | So our search began | We looked at Toyota Sequoia | way too pricey even the base SR5 | Then we looked at Nissan Armada's not bad but poor fuel economy and drive too much like a truck | Then we drove an ExpeditionEddie Bauer I was not impressed with the fit and finish and the steering was way too touchy | Then we drove our first Tahoe | I was impressed | Two days later we bought one
 "words": Bought Tahoe Z71 after driving '02 JGCL | Feels rock solid and very easy to drive even with Z71 suspension | Relative had '04 Denali and this handles effortlessly in comparison | Power is very good | Roomy interior had a 3 hour drive with 5 adults and 2 kids in car seats | 2nd and 3rd row seats are surprisingly easy to handle | 
 "words": I purchased my new 2009 Tahoe for me and my fiance and we just love it | So far it is the best vehicle I have ever purchased | This purchase made me a believer in GM | When I get ready to trade my Nissan truck I will definitely be looking at another GM product | 
 "words": This is the nicest family car we have ever owned | Once long trip since we bought it | Comfortable quiet and 19 to 20 miles per gallon using cruise control and driving in a sane manner | The fuel management system really helps with the gas | Runs on Regular | Easy to use controls | Memory seats | Dual zone heating and cooling | Both I and my husband are comfortable | 
 "words": I bought my Tahoe LT 2009 white Jan 24th 2009 | I like space and the top view because of the SUV design | The door rubber seals need to improve if you open the driver door you can see poor wilding Pocket left and right Pumpers front down which can store dirty wet material need to add protection screen for the tires to protect the SUV both sides from splash 
 "words": I traded in my 04 Yukon Denali for this Tahoe and it was a great choice | For its size the Fahoe drives so easily around the city and it's so comfortable inside | The dash looks very elegant the seats are super comfortable and the nav screen is easy to use and the design of the whole truck is great | In mostly city driving I get about 14 | 9 mpg which is great because my old Denali only got about 11 mpg
 "words": I've owned many cars and trucks all American | I have been disappointed before with GM but this new Tahoe has changed all of that | The interior has to be the best ever in an American car | The build quality is rock solid while still being elegant | This truck makes me proud to be American
