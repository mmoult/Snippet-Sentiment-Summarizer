 "words": I went to dealership to buy 2010 Venza | When I drove up saw the Red 6 | 0 Series | Told my husband that I wanted to test drive it before I ordered my Venza | Too bad for Venza that I did | Fell in love | Went in and ordered Classic Silver Metallic XB | Coolest thing I have driven | Put numerous accessories on it | Took them a wk to install them after they got it | I got leather seats sport steering wheel sport shift knob door sill illumination overhead console box auto dimming mirror upgraded audio system tinted windows floor and cargo mats cargo cover | Sure I missed some and still not finished adding yet | Everyone loves it but not as much as me | It's a head turner | Mad in love | Everyone needs 1 | 
 "words": I | ve had my 09 XB for over 7 months brand new | And since day one at over 40 M H pulls to the right | Complained to Toyota but no action was taken | I don | t like it at all sheep car yet I paid over 19500 cash for it | Took it to another shop and was told rear left tire out of alignment but Toyota didn | t provide adjustment for the rear and NO TIE ROD | means the rear has to be shimmed or something big money to do that
 "words": I have had this xB for about a month and a half and I'm still loving it like the first day | Many xB1 detractors decry the increased size but I love it | The car is more comfortable than any mid-size car | It is also quite fuel efficient considering that you are still driving a box at 65-70 mph | Recently got 34 mpg on 2hr trip to OKC quite hilly at times | My family of 5 fits quite easily on short and longish trips | The wife loves the cargo space which is much better than the '07 Pacifica she drives around town |

 "words": I love the XB but it needs some visual balance | First the single backup light needs a partner to balance the bumper | Also annoying is the fact only one armrest is provided but at least it is for the driver | And one final want for my XB would be dual pipes to really make a power statement | I guess it is the old v-8 mindset that I grew up with in the 60s | 
 "words": I just finished reading a review about the SoulCube and the XB | Scion is head over shoulders over the competition | I love the comfort unlike Honda | s board covered up with fabric when you sit on a Scion you feel like you | re on your lazyboy at home not as though you | re in some Chinese torture camp bench | Safety was a must for me side curtain airbags dual airbags ABS VSC 4 wheel disk brakes etc | I also love how everything is included in the pricing none of this | oh you wanted a steering wheel | Well that | s extra | crap | This thing is loaded | Gas mileage | The 4 speed automatic transmission has got to go and be replaced with a 5 speed | This is key for MPG | As it stands now the gas mileag
 "words": This car had pretty much what I was looking for | 1 | Space the back seat room is bigger than my wife 2002 Durango 2 | Good size cargo area 3 | Decent engine size Power and 4 | Decent Mileage | I have already put 1800 miles on and enjoy driving it | It has a lot of of spunk and great turn radius | I did my research and test drove many compact cars that was in the same price range | Nothing seemed to compare to the XB | When I work from Home my wife steals it from me | The only negatives would be the arm rest the power plug needs the key in the ignition and door console needs to be higher | overall I love the car | 
 "words": Just replaced my old 06 XB with a 09 and I love my new one way more | I'm getting 25 mpg in the city and 31 on the highway | It is more stable on the highway and feels much more substantial of a car | I get almost as much MPG out of the new one and way more power | 
 "words": I purchased my 2009 xb last year and I love it | This car is great on gas despite what the critics say I average 28 mpg with the 5 speed manual | I needed something bigger than a car to carry my tools but still got good gas millage and was sporty | I get compliments all the time on its looks and back seat space | I want to add the trd clutch shifter and maybe the intercooler eventually but I am really happy I bought this wagon | The cd player upgrade is a must for any die hard music lover I got mine upgraded for free | Thanks checkerd flag Toyota | All in all this is one bad a little toaster and I know it will last me for years to come | 
 "words": This car is more a mini minivan than a urban sedan | As a 40-something couple with a toddler this car fits us nicely | We bought this car because it met ours needs for reliability affordable price interior room good power on hills adequate gas mileage barely overall value | After 4k miles and plenty of reflection I would still buy this car but with different options Base car in blue Standard radio-touch screen version is difficult to use Upgrade suspension C-pillar rear net storage have Rear seat cargo area cover have Splash guards wheel flares ebay auto dim rear view mirror far to reach all weather floor mats and see other stuff below | 
 "words": We love the xb | Inexpensive | Simple pricing | Comfortable | Excellent acceleration | Roomy and a blast to drive | Average mileage for the first 1500 miles is 25 | 9 | Really like all the accessories that are available | Kind of like getting your 1st Harley and then start adding chrome etc | I'm buying another one this week for myself | 
 "words": I bought my xB because I needed something 'family' sized and though I wasn't too keen on it's looks I had heard great reviews from a friend who has an earlier model | Overall I think it's a great value good fuel economy great handling lots of interior space and the guaranteed reliability of a Toyota of course | I think it's a great vehicle for someone with a small family or someone who wants a different kind of small suv wagon | 
 "words": No reservation with the 09 Scion I am delighted with the buy would of love a 5 speed shift but its my work car and the reason for purchasing the car was for economic reason | The Scion has proven after three weeks of ownership a bit of a good move on my part | Economy is great roomy and fun to drive | The 2 | 4 engine make the Scion get and go economy of the car is really see at the low speeds the automatic trans could use an additional gear keeping the RPMs around 1 | 8k when on the highway and would make the Scion that much more economic for highway use but with a tight engine I got 315 miles on the first out of town trip | Please do not misunderstand the Scion is good on gasoline
 "words": I owned this car for almost 9 months now and so far I do really enjoy the comfort of my car sometimes id Rather seat in the back if my sister can drive for me nor my friends because the seats are so comfy specially the back seat | And its gas saver and the a c is really really cold and I have plenty of room in the back I need it for my son's stroller | And I really recommend this car you will never regret it | 
 "words": I've only had my Scion XB for a week but I just love the way it handles making turns sitting in it is so comfortable gas mileage is very good | It has so much room | It drives so smooth that I have to watch my speed because I don't realize that I'm going that fast | The drivers door arm rest could be a little higher but that isn't a big deal | Definitely would recommend it | 
 "words": Hard decision xB or xD I bought the xB as the seat is adjustable just not high enough | Maybe if the side mirrors weren't so big they leave blind spots | Also I need to have the seat way forward so now window controls are hard to find and door arm rest too low | Otherwise I love the drive ease of turning gas mileage in town and instrument panel | Rides nice on our horrible streets too | 
 "words": Very pleased with my xB averaging 28 mpg 50 50 around town highway driving what is so-so about that | I'm sure it will average 30 mpg on a long highway trip | Practical and fun to drive 2 | 4L has plenty of pep | Interior is sparse but functional | I like the 2008 body style I receive a lot of compliments and there is plenty of room inside | I don't find the center mount gauges distracting and the steering wheel position is just fine | I find it interesting that professional reviewers generally knock the car yet actual owners love it | 
 "words": I am pleased but not | super excited | with my Scion so far | I have just under 5K on it and have a good feel for the ride | I HONESTLY could use more leg room and I | m only 5'9 | I find it difficult to get comfortable | The interior of my 05 Corolla has more width between the center console and the driver | s door | Sort of weird considering how big the rest of the interior is | It has nice pick up and handling | I | ve done two checks on the mileage thus far | One all around and one this past weekend for a highway trip of about 200 miles one way 400 total | Mileage was much less that what I expected | All around was about 22 and Highway was only 24 | actually 23 | 5 Pretty bad if you ask me | 
 "words": I traded in a 2006 Mini Cooper for this little Limited Edition Absolutely Red Xb and I have no regrets | This car is value packed and offers practicality at an affordable price | This edition comes with a built in navigation system that is great equal to my Garmin bluetooth etc | and is a joy to drive | Previous to buying I looked at the Honda Element Kia Soul Nissan Rogue and Mini Clubman and for the value Scion was the clear choice | The pickup is great the interior is well thought and the materials used are better than I would have got if I had purchased another make | 
 "words": We drove our Scion to Nor Cal over Christmas | I spent 21hrs behind the wheel at one point no backache totally comfortable | Plus fit me my hubby my mom my son a week's worth of luggage plus souvenirs for four quite easily | Perfect family car for 3-4 peps | Got 29-30mpg on the freeways | 
 "words": I've had this car for about a month now and I've ran up about 1100 miles on it | Each time I take it out to drive I like it a little bit more and I loved it when I bought it | The xB isn't the fastest sportiest or most luxurious car I've owned but it's pretty fun to drive it handles well and it has a comfortable ride whether I've been on road trips or just cruising around town | It's a nice balance in pretty much all fronts which is surprising for a car this cheap | Also the folks at Scion are a pleasure to deal with | I've also noticed that a lot of people complain about the fuel economy of the xB but I've found that I've gotten between 28 to 33 mph which isn't that bad | 
 "words": I did a lot of research before I purchase this car | It is my run around car but this is one I will keep for a long time | I have had no problems at all with almost 20000 miles | I average about 26 miles in mixed driving and 33 miles on the highway | I added several things to it from the dealership Sun Roof Fog lights Alloy wheels Spolier Bumper name on the back Rear cargo deck TRS exhause system TRS Air Filter | I have taken it on several long trips with no problems | I will let the seats down and carry things | This car beats The HHR Mazda 3 and the Element I test drove them all | 
 "words": I bought my 2009 xB used with 5k miles on it | The guy before me had put 5k in features like wheels spoiler upgraded stereo and he even put light up door sill strips on it | I am completely satisfied with the features price and reliability | This is probably the best investment I have ever made aside from buying a house | I recommend this vehicle to everybody even people taller than 6ft | I am 6'1 and 220 lbs and I feel like I am driving a school bus | 
 "words": Having put the first 1000 miles on my new SCION xB I am very impressed with the power drivability and comfort | I am a big guy and I have plenty of leg and head room | The car itself seems much larger inside than one would expect | I am averaging 28 | 9 MPG so far which I am very happy about as well | Overall I could not be happier | 
 "words": I am retired and I wanted a fun and economical car with space to carry things | I drove 12 cars before buying my xB | I like the ride the handling and the large cargo space | The car is responsive and fun to drive | To make it even more fun I added several Toyota dealer installed products including a cold air intake free flow exhaust 18 wheels and performance tires | The normal good acceleration is now fantastic | Best of all the highway mileage is now over 31 mpg | 
 "words": After a lot of research I traded my 2007 4 door Silvarado for my dream 2009 Stingray Metallic xb Auto | Looks like the best 17000 auto on the market | Wanted headroom upright seating all necessary features as standard 25 mpg and yeah something different | I love it and the extra room in the garage | have 'aerodynimcs are overrated' and 'it's hip to be square' decals | 5000 miles and no problems | 
 "words": I bought my Son-in-law an XB 18 months ago and when we got back to Seattle decided to buy myself one | I was looking at the Honda CRV but at 10K more I just couldn't justify the cost | Granted the CRV is a more plush car functionally they are very similar | I wish the XB had an extra 12v outlet but other than that it's exceeded my expectations | After 1 week of driving we are averaging 25 | 7mpg MUCH better than I expected | I didn't get many of the extras unlike my Son-in-Laws car but I did get the rear cargo deck | Only one other thing I'd be critical of is the Pioneer Radio | It has an SSR feature that I can't quite get right | Anyway overall a wonderful cost effective car | 
 "words": As an engineer I researched new cars for 6 months before buying | We're expecting a second child and needed more room over our Mazda Protege | The Scion xB is the best value possible | The rear seating beats EVERYTHING we looked at | Grown-ups can sit back there no other vehicle offered this | I had a 1993 Toyota Pickup with the I4 2 | 4L engine and loved it this engine has the juice when you need it | I added the cold air intake for a little more HP at the cost of a few MPG's | We're seeing 28MPGs but with 128 FT3 interior space that's actually pretty amazing | It is a bit heavy and catches a lot of wind but its meant more for utility not speed | Great for small families | 
 "words": I bought the Scion because I was impressed with the standard features that came on it and the interior roominess | I am over 6 feet tall and about 300 lbs and am comfortable in the front or back seats | Car is quick and nimble to drive but a lot of road feel | Could get better mileage only about 28 ave | Most disappointed after driving less than 1000 miles less than 2 weeks the check engine light came on | Took it to a dealer who fixed it and 4 days later had the same problem | Now they are replacing the transmission | Sure it's under warranty but that does nothing for my time lost work and aggravation | Sadly disappointed at Toyota quality | Is in the shop more than my driveway | 
 "words": I like this car a lot but I find the suspension to be a little bouncy for my taste | Acceleration is surprisingly good and I find it to be exceptionally maneuverable | Biggest gripe No Daytime Running Lights not even as an option | Lights are required in work zones here so that's annoying | My wife is petite so she has to use a cushion because the side mirrors are in an awkward spot in her field of view | Other than that it's a real crowd-pleaser | Lots of people come up and want to talk about it | 
 "words": I was able to haggle the price to invoice AND lease for same money as the national offer that's available for the Corolla | I'm a big guy and I find ingress excellent with great seating position | However the seats are barely acceptable with limited adjustment and no lower back support | I should have paid more attention to this detail b4 purchase | Furthermore the seating room is plentiful but the center console rubs my knee pretty hard | I may velcro on a little padding and solve this problem | Ride and handling are excellent | Car feels solid wind noise is nil engine is awesome | Although sheetmetal is flimsy i think structure is solid and the complement of airbags make car pretty safe
 "words": You sit a little higher in the XB than you do in normal sedans | Not as high as an SUV back in the day I drove a Jeep Cherokee but high enough to provide better sight lines on the road | The interior feels very roomy and the seats are the most comfortable of all the cars I tried before purchasing the XB | The automatic transmission works well for downshifting when roads are snowy ice covered | Could not ask for more at this price | 
 "words": Coming from a 1999 Toyota Camry I can truly say that this is the perfect car for me | As a college student the flexibility performance and gas mileage of the car were all needed | The car handles wonderfully looks great and is extremely reliable | My previous Camry had zero problems for the entire 160000 miles | Toyota quality is unsurpassed and is quite evident in this vehicle | My only gripe is that the ride is a little bumpy | You do feel most every bump in the road | 
 "words": Talk about one fun little ride | This car feels more like an SUV | I love the style and room that this little jewel has | You can not go wrong with the price or the gas mileage | I traded in my 4 door toyota yaris and so glad I did | The yaris is great for the money but has nothing to offer as extras like this great ride | The yaris had no power windows locks or keyless entry and not to mention the cheap carpet in it | I bought a black 5 speed manual and had the dealership put a hot pink stripe on the side | I am a 38 year old mother of 2 teenagers who also love my car | Can't wait to add the hot pink wheels for the final touch | I am still young at heart and this car makes me feel it | 
 "words": I've owned my XB since August | I'm very pleased with it | Mileage is OK I avg | about 27 mpg overall | Surprisingly quiet with a decent ride for it's size | It also has alot of zip and cruises fully loaded at freeway speeds with no problem | I'm a good sized guy and there is plenty of room and it is very easy to get in and out of both front and back seats | Tons of head room | 
 "words": Had my '09 XB for six months now 10000 miles already and NO problems | Absolutely flawless | And I'm getting 31 | 8 MPG | 
 "words": Although my fiance' is the owner of this vehicle I drive it a heck of a lot and I am giving serious consideration to trading my 05 tC for one of these | My family has two first-gen xBs and while they are what put Scion on the map and are still cool the gen2 xB is a dramatic improvement over the first generation albeit a little less funky-looking | The xB purists may not like it but I do | In the Stingray Metallic color this little wagon looks great | the only accessories ordered at delivery were fog lights overhead console and rear bumper applique | My fiance' traded in a 2001 Taurus for this vehicle and she doesn't regret it | This is her first non-Ford vehicle | 
 "words": Luv this car so far | Comfortable and I am a BIG guy | People love it after they ride in it | Don't mind the ugly aspect I think it looks like a cool funky hearse | I do 130 miles a day on I95 | The power boost is there when I need it | 30 to 70 in a couple seconds leaves those 18 wheelers in the dust | Dealer provides the 1st two checks 5000 and 10000 miles | Great room in the back when I drop the seats | It doesn't feel like a strong built car but only time will tell | 
 "words": I have a young son with mobility problems | Most SUV's are a challenge for him because of the step in height | The XB is easy for him to get into mostly without assistance and the cargo area is big enough for his foldaway wheelchair | I like the clean design of both the interior and exterior | Although I wish the materials used in the interior were nicer and of better quality | Most interior surfaces are hard to the touch and black | I added a custom leather steering wheel cover because the standard steering wheel was rough and uncomfortable to grip | 
 "words": The 09 Scion is the best designed car I have ever owned and I am a mechanical designer and a detail nut | Every design aspect of this car is very well thought out | It reminds me of the interior of a boat in the efficiency of the storage compartments | It should be 'Car of the Year for 09' | 
 "words": I have put about 1500 miles on my XB and feel that I have driven it enough to write a review | I have had absolutely no problems with it so far so good | I went to the dealership after reading reviews about the XD and felt it was a little too small | I didn't particularly like the look of the XB until I drove it | I was in love | And still am | I get alot more positive comments on it than I had expected | It's fun to drive and can get up and go if you need it to | Bottom line If you are looking for a fun reliable car under 20K | the XB is the right car for you | 
 "words": With less than 5000 miles racked up I like my xB more each time I drive it | I did extensive research before I bought even considering a CRV or Rav4 | But I always came back to the xB for its fuel efficiency interior space cargo room and price | It handles well and with 158 hp it is much more responsive than some others in its class like the Honda Fit | 
 "words": I ordered my xB with only the floor mats and an upgraded stereo | I did choose the automatic transmission for my xB | Shortly after my purchase I had to make a 2000 mile trip | At posted speeds the car proved very solid on the road and achieved 32 MPG on the first 300 miles of the trip | The vehicle handles well in the city and I quickly acclimated to the awkward interior which included the center mounted gauges | The shelf in front of the steering wheel was perfect for my GPS | My kids couldn't believe I bought such an ugly car until they got inside | The whole family loves the spacious interior and I love the great cost of ownership and the information display | Quite a bargain at 18K | 
 "words": The XB is the greatest | Great for large people both in the front and rear seats | 27-29 mpg on a regular basis | Easily cruises at 80 mph on the open highway | Fun to drive | Also have a Porsche Boxster and would have to say I enjoy the XB more-makes my wife happy | The only negatives that I have are like everyone else is the armrest and mostly the lack of electrical outlets for cell phones gps etc | This is really a stylish great car with great performance at a more than fair price | 
 "words": I'm just in love with this vehicle | I traded in an '07 Nissan Altima which I absolutely hated and I'm so happy I did | There is not one thing I dislike about this car | It's so roomy but still small and incredibly fun to drive | I love how you sit up in it and can see out of it so well like an SUV | It's very peppy with the 2 | 4L engine and it handles perfectly | I have the Stingray color and it is just beautiful | I adore the styling of this car | it's so cute | This is an awesome ride for truly anyone | I'm a 25 year old girl on the go and it does everything I want it to | Test drive one of these and you will understand why this car rocks | 
 "words": Decided to leave the SUV market and traded in my Tribute for the xB after the test drive | The ride fit and finish and comfort can't be matched for an auto under 20000 tremendous bang for your buck | Toyota got it right with the 2nd generation xB | Well done | 
 "words": I just took my 2008 gold rush 5 | 0 314 for its 10000 mile oil change | This has been the best car I have owned | This is my everyday driver to work 100 miles round to NYC and my toy box on the weekend | Easy to buy without the BS | Very fun to drive | I added a TRD cold air intake and it gets up and goes better then my Hemi Magnum | I have a Thule roof rack for my 17' kayak and bike at the same time | Love it or hate it the Xb is a lot for little money and gets noticed more and I get more questions then cars I have spent 3 times the amount on | Not the car for you if you like to hide | Enjoy |
