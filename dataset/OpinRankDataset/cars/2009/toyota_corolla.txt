REVIEWS
 "words": The Corolla is a good commuter car that will retain its value and last for years | It's cheap honest transportation with a few bonuses like standard side impact airbags | The biggest drawback with the '09 Corolla is the steering | It's incredibly vague and drifts on the freeway | Looking back I wish I would have leased the car with a manual transmission | At the time there weren't that many on the lot | I love Toyotas in general | We also have an '87 Camry in the family | Service has been very good at our local dealer | 
 "words": My 2009 Corolla LE has about 23000 miles on it and steers great and handles great | That wasn't always the case | The car used to steer like the front was toed in | The problem issues were that the car was out of alignment in the rear and the Goodyear Eagle tires | The rear axle of an LE is a stamped axle and has no alignment adjustment | I had to have an alignment shop modify the rear axle bolt position to bring the car into a correct factory assignment | Once that was done the car steers as you would expect and it gained about 2 miles per gallon in fuel economy | I also replaced the Goodyear Eagle tires which are not safe on wet pavement with Yokohama Avid Tour S tires | Now a very nice car | 
 "words": I have owned my 2009 Toyota Corolla LE since May 2008 | I purchased it right after they became available at my local dealership and traded my 2004 Corolla which I loved | I fell in love with the redesigned body style of the 2009 model but that's where the love ends | The biggest complaint I and many other owners that I have talked to have with the 2009 Corolla is the Electric Power Steering | I cannot for the life of me keep the car in a straight line when traveling over 50mph | I think that it is a design flaw that should get looked into | Other than that rather annoying and potentially unsafe aspect the build quality is comparable with the 2004 model | Gas mileage is about 35mpg | 
 "words": This is absolutely the most boring car I've ever owned | I've owned everything from sedans to coupes to convertibles and trucks this is the least inspiring car I could ever imagine to own | I drive a lot for work and I just wanted something with good fuel economy and a reputation for reliability | I suppose it has that in spades but that's all it has | In a practical sense there is nothing wrong with the car | It does what it's meant to do but I hate driving this car | I can't wait until I get rid of it | The engine is lifeless and the steering and handling are non-existent | Boring boring boring boring | I will probably never buy another Toyota and would never buy a Lexus either | 
 "words": Overall I like my Corolla | I chose a Corolla base on its reputation and Intellichoice | com recommendation | Along with the Civic it has the lowest Total Cost of Ownership | The reason I picked the Corolla it was simply because Toyota gave me more for the money alloy wheels power locks and windows etc | I am intending to keep this car for a few years so I bought extended warranty and paint and rust protection | Toyota could have worked on the interior a bit | The stereo seems cheap quality | 
 "words": We bought this car after the engine went on our 2002 Nissan Altima | Very happy with the styling handling etc | with the Corolla | Nice head room for my boyfriend as he is 6'2 vs | the Civic | Negotiated a great deal and even had the dealer put in leather seats and front seat heaters | 
 "words": This was my very first purchase of a Toyota vehicle and I am simply amazed | by everything from the friendly and cooperative salesmen to the overall quality and value of this car | I was so impressed with this vehicle I actually found myself trying to find something not to like | I Thought to myself well this car cant be that good can it | Well that is just nutty | This is the perfect car for me in fact I look at it as a gift | I know that may sound a little strange or perhaps sappy but that is exactly how I feel like it or not | Assuming Toyota continues with this level of quality and affordability I will be a customer for life | 
 "words": Great car overall our 5th Toyota | Fuel consumption is good about 5 | 5 litres 100km on long runs 6 | 8 around town | Very sensitive steering | This is not a problem but does require more attention while driving or the car can be in the wrong lane very quickly | Have experienced a rumble knock in front region of car plus rattles in sun roof | Dealer changed windshield thinking it was flexing body | This didn't solve problem | Dealer has just replaced a front strut housing which has solved problem | Now we only have minor rattles | 
 "words": Great looks at affordable price real good on gas mileage average 30 | 9 miles to the gallon rarely drive on freeway mostly stop and go | Does lack in the power area but a real great commuter car | 
 "words": I'm very disappointed | I have had this car 11 months now and my intermediate shaft has given out my brakes replaced rotators SHAVED and intermediate shaft replaced | I have taken my car to the dealership 3 times and finally had them sit in car to listen before something was done about brakes | The recall is only in northern states for the brakes | Although all of the above has been done | Costing me time and no car during the days being fixed | 
 "words": I drive 18 miles each way to work and it's a pleasure to drive the Corolla | I like the instant mpg monitor | Even at 27 city 35 hwy EPA I average 33 mpg and hit 43 | 51 mpg on the highway over a 150 mile trip | I filled up drove and filled again on return | It's very quiet for a compact the stereo is decent and I am beginning to like the electronic power steering a lot more | As it breaks in it is getting better mileage | I got the gray with gray window tint and its classy looking without adding anything to it | Brakes are great haven't had it in the snow yet | Very little wind noise on the highway | Seats are comfortable visibility good | Good rear legroom | Smokes the competitors | 
 "words": Purchased the car in September and already have over 1200 miles on it | Purchased it for the great gas millage and low price but I agree with other reviews that it is a very basic car and some of the features were poorly thought out like the center armrest and the clock | However for the money this is a great car | It takes some getting use to the electronic power steering but for a 1 | 8 liter engine there is lots of pep in this car | I am averaging 33 | 5 MPG so far and overall am pleased with the purchase | The best news was that the dealer was extremely anxious to deal on price | way better price then the TMZ price | In addition the zero percent financing sealed the deal | 
 "words": I was looking for an old man's car when I bought this one | From that perspective I couldn't be happier | I've got a dealership installed leather option called a Platinum package | The electric power steering is reminiscent of the old 50's luxury cars and I love it | One finger steering at idle | I only have 1700 miles on it but am seriously impressed | The lack of styling is disappointing reminds me of a '51 Willys sedan but I didn't buy it to impress anyone | The interior is comfortable and quiet | I had a 2008 rental for a couple of weeks and this is much better I wouldn't have bought a 2008 model | I've had 2 Toyotas a 1970 Corona MKII and a 1987 pickup | They were both rock solid reliable | 
 "words": 38 | 9 MPG | Do I need to say anything else | I travel 30000 highway miles annually and since purchasing the 2009 in July of 2008 the LE is providing great fuel economy reliability technology and above average comfort | The only design flaw is the lack of proper location of arm rests for the drivers seat | This really comes in play on the highway | not as much in the city | Suggestion If you log the high miles purchase the bumper-to-bumper package | For the additional 700 | 00 it will pay itself off in the off-chance this Toyota has a major mechanical failure | Signed Satisfied Toyota Owner 
 "words": Good car | Car is comfortable and rides very nice | good interior and trunk space | tire pressure warning light has come on twice in three months | Brought car back to dealer to have tire checked | They couldn't find any problems and said this is a normal warning | Not completely satisfied with answer | 
 "words": I've owned just about every car made over the years | I needed a car that got great fuel economy and didn't look like an egg going down the road | The Corolla S looks great runs great and I average over 40 mpg on the freeway with my 70 mile commute every day | The new 2009 interior is comfortable on the long drives much better than the 2008 | I like just about everything about the car and the price was more than fair for something that I know will last me over 200k miles with no problems | 
 "words": Driving this car is actually a lot more fun than people give it credit for | Yes it is an economy car but it can get up to speed quickly enough to pass other cars | It has a very sporty look even at the LE grade and generally doesn't look like every other car on the road | The electronic power steering takes some getting used to but overall I haven't had a bad experience with this car | Gets great gas mileage on the highway in my opinion | I drive mostly mixed hwy city driving and so far the best I've gotten is 35MPG | 
 "words": I purchased our new 2009 Corolla to do some extensive traveling | We find the car excellent in the city but on the highway it is terrible | The car is uncomfortable seats armrests lumbar support left foot positioning blind spots | The worst problem is a vibration at highway speeds that the dealership says is normal | We are so disappointed in our new Corolla and are considering dealing it at only 3000 kilometers | 
 "words":  Since our 99 'Civic was totaled while stopped at a red light I decided to look around at other brands of cars After examining everything on the market I bought a new 09' Corolla LE | Why | Toyota's reputation for reliability is seldom matched and competing brands weren't outstanding | It's a solid feeling car that performs as well or better than almost any other economy vehicle | The mileage is superb with about a half-and-half mix of heavy town traffic and mountain driving it has averaged 35 | 8 MPG | Much better than advertised | I don't shove my foot through the gas pedal but it keeps up with traffic just fine | The Hot Car magazines may pan it but average drivers will be happy | 
 "words": I sold my 2004 LE to buy this 2009 LE | This is my 4th Corolla since 1993 | I have always found the newly designed models to have things that I enjoyed more than the old ones until the 2009 | I still respect the reliability the no-frills down to earth never-break-down-at-3AM Corolla experience | It is basic solid transportation | We all know that | The 09 looks sleek and nice and it is until you get inside and you wonder who fell asleep at the wheel literally | The armrests are useless the CD holder spaces are gone the coin tray is so tilted all the coins fall out the wood grain is gone on the LE the knobs look outdated and the interior looks cheap and flimsy | What were they thinking | 
 "words": This is a typical Corolla | plain boring reliable | It's a great appliance for getting from point A to point B | There is nothing that makes me smile while driving this car other than knowing it is much more reliable than my GM cars and truck and gets excellent mileage per gallon | If you want a car that does the job without a lot of fuss one that doesn't draw attention negatively or positively then this might be the car for you | If you're looking for a thrilling driving experience this is not it | We got exactly what we wanted with this car- no hassles and reliability | After being a GM owner those are wonderful things to have in a car | 
 "words": This car is awesome | It's durable and reliable | I feel so comfortable and safe while driving in this car | The seats are super comfy the outside look of the car is hot and it handles well around turns speeding up quickly etc | I shopped around for a new car for quite some time and I'm very happy with my choice | It's great for the money great on gas great look worth every penny | 
 "words": I bought my new 2008 Toyota Corolla S red a few days ago | I was looking for a new car but didn't know what I wanted | I was looking at Honda Nissan and Toyotas | I test drove an 08 Toyota Corolla and didn't like it | When I saw the 09 Corolla S it looked real sharp | The car was smooth riding and looks sporty | This car really turns heads | In case you're looking at the car colors on toyota | com the colors online don't do the actual color justice | I was skeptical of the red when I found out that's the car the dealership found for me | But when I saw the car in person it looked totally different than what that what I saw on Toyota's website | You won't be disappointed | 
 "words": We have just had our Corolla for three week but my wife and I really like the car | We just returned from out first road trip and averaged 38 mpg | Our first tank of gas with city driving got 29 mpg | The car is very quiet handles great and is fun to drive | We were looking for a balance of safety fuel efficiency and reliability | We tested the Civic Mazda 3 Hyundai Elantra and a number of midsized cars | We also liked the Honda Civic but being 6'3 I felt I had more room in the Corolla | Yes the electronic steering is a tad sensitive but we got use to it very quickly | With over 30 million Corollas sold world wide it is now the best selling car in the world | 
 "words": After 5600 miles with 4500 of those on vacation and road trips i can say that this 09 Corolla is worth a look at | The steering is not what some say you get used to it in fact it feels better than our 00 Lexus RX300 to me | I have had 6 new cars since 1998 3 Hondas 1 Subaru 2 Toyotas and this is a good value | I am 5-11 210 lbs and the ride on trips is great the MP3 is great I am getting 32-38 and it is not even broken in | I have a friend that has a 2003 he put over 300k then sold it now has a 2006 with 110k and no issues | He gets over 40 mpg all the time on the hwy |

 "words": I'm 48 and have driven many cars in my life | But after 5500 miles I can say none that were this uncomfortable | And I like Toyotas | The tilt wheel won't go low enough the arm rest is too far back right or just worthless left the steering wheel isn't open on the bottom so you can't hang your hand there | The car gets blown all over the road in crosswinds and that with electric 'no feel' steering makes you look like a drunk driver on a windy day | Get 34 mpg at steady 75 mph 29 around town in mixed driving | Good seats good stereo excellent cruise | The car rolls a lot in turns but rides very nicely | Great for short trips wouldn't recommend for long trips | 
 "words": The design of the 2009 Corolla Sport model leaves a lot to be desired | First they do not offer intermittent wipers at all in this model which was a shock | The head rests on the seats lean forward and your head is up against the headrest | The front seats do not go back far enough so you are cramped | The clock is not separate anymore | There is a button you have to push 7 times to get back around to the clock located behind the wheel to the left | Look before you buy a Sport model | Do not assume that normal options come in every model | I love Corollas but I hate the Sport model | It's still fun to drive but I can't get comfortable | I prefer driving my mothers 2006 Corolla | 
 "words": I've had my Corolla for two months now it did 25 | 8 mpg city with a heavy gas hitter | The trunk has room for all my golf clubs and the split seat works well for my fishing rods | The placement of everything is logical accept the clock | The center console is a bit small along with the little compartment with the outlet | The plastic does scratch easily leaving marks | Everything feels solid nothing loose and feeling like it would break | The seating position can fit all I'm 5'11 with long legs and it's really comfortable | If your looking for an economy car that gives you the most bang for the buck this is it | A very big improvement from last year's model |

 "words": I just purchased the new 2009 Corolla LE over the weekend and I love it so far | The S model was too sporty for me so decided to get the LE model and it pretty much has everything I need such as power windows power locks a c keyless entry etc | I was going to get the Yaris but after test driving both vehicles I noticed Corolla had more power and felt safer in the Corolla | 
 "words": The Corolla XLE is a great car | I have been getting 36 mpg in stop and go traffic | Highway mileage as been 47 mpg with the AC off and driving between 55-60 mph | 
 "words": This is my 5th Corolla | It does not disappoint | I average about 34 mpg | The controls are very easy to operate and make this a very convenient vehicle | The design of this car is very attractive | I have received many compliments | In a world where gas prices are peaking out into outer space the Corolla is a very good buy | 
 "words": This is without a doubt a great car | The ride is smooth and quiet and I am averaging about 31 mpg on mostly highway miles | The transmission shifts great and the JBL XM radio stereo is a blast | Oddly enough though it ejects a CD and then shuts off once in a while for no reason | The dealer said that this could be caused by using colored or labeled CDs makes sense but this happens even when using the FM or XM radio too weird | Also the roof is leaking and during rain water is coming though the inside of the A pillars into the interior | But overall this is the best car I have ever owned and assuming they can fix the roof leak I will definitely buy a Toyota again |

 "words": We purchased a 2009 Toyota Corolla LE May 31 2008 | At about 2000 miles the VSC Light came on flashing | Took it back to dealer and they could not find anything wrong | The light came back on and it started to spit and sputter and die for no reason around 3000 miles | Took it back to dealer and they replaced the Mass Air Flow Sensor and cleared the codes again | Was driving it again and slowed down to turn a corner and it died for no reason | It currently has 4500 miles on it and the dealer has had it for a week | They called and said they are ordering a new wiring harness which is supposed to fix the problem | I'm now wondering what will be next |

 "words": I upgraded from a 1998 Malibu which gave me fits for reliability but interior was much better the power mirror adjustment on the Toyota is on the dash and difficult to reach when driving | arm rest on the driver left is not usable so you have to rest your arm on the window ledge the arm rest on the right is too far back | the clock is tucked into driver's instrument panel and tiny | and none of the cup holders have liners to take out for washing | In general the interior is just flat out cheap | On the upside the readouts for gas usage are terrific the car runs great and looks good | Just wish Toyota had spent the extra few dollars on the interior |

 "words": We purchased a 2009 Corolla LE about 8 weeks ago and have been very happy with the purchase | The car came with many features like automatic headlights and programmable door locks that we would have expected with a much more expensive vehicle | The car is used mainly for running around town and short trips | While the car is comfortable for short trips I am not sure I would take it on trips of more than 2 hours one way because the seats seem uncomfortable after driving for extended periods of time | We have been making fewer stops at the gas station as we are averaging just over 36 mpg | Overall I would definitely recommend this car to anyone considering a small fuel efficient vehicle |

 "words": The car is small but does not feel cramped at least in the front seat | The back seats are a bit cramped | It would be hard to get 4 full sized adults in the car without some one ending up with a knee in their back | The driver seat is ok but seriously lacks lumbar support | Finding a place for your elbows while you drive is also difficult | Most of the controls are laid out in a logical manner and are easy to find | However the temp gauge is nearly hidden in the lower right hand corner of the dash display | In an economy car you expect a plastic dash but feel of the plastics used in the Corolla are very harsh | The turn signal stalks feel very cheap |

 "words": I've always been fond of Corollas and have driven them in the past | I was disappointed to find after purchasing this one that these new models don't have the same great handling and steering that I've experienced in the older models | I find especially when driving on the freeway that the car wanders and I don't feel likr I have a lot of control | I have to grip the steering wheel more intensely which doesn't bode well for me since I had hoped to be able to use this car for road trips | Aside from steering the car has met all of my other expectations | It's highly fuel efficient has a great new look and size and the interior features are easy to manage | 
 "words": Disappointed after 7 months | Interior plastic trim is already breaking and seems to scuff easily | 2 major repairs sunroof rattling seat height adjustment would not hold | Seat is still not working correctly | Sound system not great | No rear dome light no glove box light or lock no lights on visor mirrors | Cloth upholstery is a dirt magnet unless you buy Toyota's protection package | Wipers don't work when there's frost on the window until the car warms up | I bought this to replace my gas guzzling Honda mini van | Corolla about 30 MPG with mixed freeway and street driving which I consider very good | Wish I'd stuck with Honda | Had looked at the Fit | More bang for the buck | 
 "words": This is a great car for those of you looking for fuel economy | After my Honda Civic was totaled I got the Corolla | I wanted something similar to the Civic but more affordable | So far I don't have any complaints | I just took a 1000 mile trip to Oregon and I average about 32 MPG | I think that is a pretty dang good average | It was comfortable and easy to drive the whole way | I loved it | 
 "words": The car is ok compared to a Civic | I don't like that the car does not have an oil filter | Rattle noise on driver's side | The car does not shift properly until the engine is fully warmed up | Overall if you are looking for an economy car that's reliable and gets good gas mileage then this is the car for you | The car has no soul | not fun to drive by any means | Strictly a commuter car | 
 "words": We bought this car for my wife to run around town and back and forth to work | We traded in a 2000 Nissan Xterra and my wife is very happy with it so am I | We average 30 mpg city and 40-42 Hwy safe range is about 400 miles on the Hwy The 1 | 8 auto has plenty of get up and go and the transmission is fantastic | Ride and handling is good electric steering requires correct driving form on the hwy both hands on the wheel around town its great for parking | We recently took it on a 1200 mile road trip loaded up with 2 adults and young child very comfortable although the door armrests are annoyingly low | We have always owned Toyota or Nissan our old 93 Tercel had over 200000 miles when sold | 
 "words": This review is to update my previous review | Please take your 2009 Corolla for a highway test drive I wish I had | Toyota Canada can not fix a vibration shudder at highway speeds | I have had it in numerous times for repairs even a team from L | A | could not resolve the problem | Apparently Japan is looking for a fix | I am picking up my brand new GM product tomorrow Toyota has lost a customer for life | I was pleased with the effort Toyota made in the repairs but totally disappointed in the end result they simply left me hanging with a defective car | 
 "words": My wife traded in our 2008 Accord LX-P because of the sever wind road noise | Only had the Accord less than eight months | Have had the Corolla for almost a month and she just loves it | It is quieter than the Accord and rides just as well or better | We put 17 wheels on it and it really looks sharp | The gas mileage is about 36 mpg on her daily commute of 85mi round trip I like the comfortable seats and the power is more than enough to get you on the freeway | Can't say enough good things about the car | It was a great trade as far as we are concerned | 
 "words": Until recently I owned three BMWs and love the It's about the ride but do not love it is about the money and the maintenance so my stable has changed and I am down to one old 318i | That said the little S is fantastic no heated seats but automatic lights JBL stereo with Bluetooth for the phone to be legal and best of all appears primarily only oil changes ever 5k until about 150k miles and that is so unlike a BMW | The reliability factor is worth the change | OK it doesn't drive like a BMW but again 35 plus miles per gallon and in this economy it just made sense | 
 "words":  The Corolla features a timing chain rather than the usual belt and has variable valve timing on both camshafts | The mileage is acceptable although the speedometer reads about 2 mph fast at 35 mph | The fuel flow indicator shows 35 | 4 mpg after 1800 total miles but the actual fuel consumption is 33 | 1 mpg | Adjusted for the previously mentioned speedometer error that's about an actual 31 mpg | It has much more power than expected and the full-time electric power steering is O | K | when I became accustomed to it | I'd buy it again and the price is right compared with the available competition | 
 "words": This is an update | This car is well built and gets good gas mileage | That is expected of Toyota | What I have found after driving the car for over 10000 miles is that it is not very comfortable | The seats are kind of hard when driving more than 2 hours and the arm rests are too hard | Now for the reason for the update This new car the car that was to be my reliable commuter is now parked for the winter | After a 3 hour trip two weeks ago | On the way there there was some heavy rain and wind | The car was nearly uncontrollable | The tires hydroplaned often | On the way back it snowed | The car was blown around and was difficult to drive | All season tires worthless | Be careful | 
 "words": This is an update of my earlier review | Now that we have had our Corolla for several months I can be more accurate about the mpg | With careful driving we can get 30 mpg in the city and 40 mpg on the highway using the AC will reduce this to about 28 38 mpg | This is fantastic for any car | Fast drivers will of course get less | We drive between 65 and 70 on the freeways | All in all the Corolla is a great value for the money | 
 "words": After buying a car it's a great feeling when you realize that the car is a lot better than what you had expected | I brought it as cheap car for my long daily commute and I am extremely happy with it | It's a little weak on power but besides that it is great | I am getting an average of 39 mpg | Great for single person commuting | I would recommend Camry if there will be more than two passenger | 
 "words": I went to the dealership to get a Prius and ended up with a Corolla | Bad decision | If I was looking at fuel efficiency and fun to drive and style in a Toyota I should've listened to my gut feeling and picked up the Yaris hatchback instead | It's far more pleasing to the eye | The Corolla only excels in build quality and fuel efficiency | These are major things for most people and most people seem to definitely go past the looks and driving dynamics of this awkward-looking refrigerator | The interior is not bad except it looks more like the Korean cars of yesteryear the floaty ride is good if I am the passenger and 4-speed auto is to dated so as the drum rear brakes | 
 "words": We bought this car last month after much contemplation | No matter how we put it this was the best choice for our money in this economy | yes I used to drive a BMW 525i so it was not an easy decision for me | So far we are very happy with the performance of this car | Mileage is excellent runs smooth not so great on the luxury but the money we spent on BMW repairs I rather go for an okay looking car that is cheaper to maintain and lasts much longer | The feel of steering is amazing like a luxury vehicle | Mileage is unbeatable | I am petite my husband is 5'11 and we find the arm rest okay when it's slided front but could have been better | 
 "words": I've had the chance to own several new cars in the past 4 yrs ranging from a luxurious sport sedan to a crossover | The engine didn't start to feel powerful until about 300 miles | I test drove the LE trim w std wheels and it felt like it would tip over in turns but the S I bought has wider 16 alloy wheels and feels much steadier | XRS w wider 17 should handle better yet | Steering is very soft seems to have a mind of its own | Ride is nicely isolated and road surface noises are muted well compared to my crossover | Interior looks much nicer than the Civic IMO but several interior areas like the dash and center console are made of hard cheap feeling plastic | 
 "words": This is a Corolla but it looks sportier than previous model | Personally I like to to look like a Corolla S which got a 1 | 8L powerplant i | e | people will think that they can easily pass me | My XRS usually surprises people driving an Integra who think they can overtake me from stop except they brutally cut into line then I give up | It got tremendous torque for such a small car | However it does come with a price the gas mileage isn't great at all | Besides the suspension is a bit too stiff | You can feel every manhole cover and every uneven spots on the road a bit annoying | Aside from that it is a nice little car storage is great and interior feels spacious | 
 "words": The Corolla S is affordable has great styling an interior that doesn't rattle an engine that will scoot- is quiet- and gets way over 30 mpg and most importantly is a compact car that has a respectable trunk | I am averaging 37 mpg so far with about 70 highway driving | The car will easily accelerate when you need to pass | The transmission is great picks a gear and does not struggle up hills quick to comply with a downshift if you put your foot down | The trunk opening is HUGE much larger than a Cobalt | Seats are comfy | AC blows cold | JBL stereo is incredible I set ASL off Bass 2 and Treble 4 | Turn it to 45 and ROCK
 "words": Had an 08 and put 27000 on it but the 09 is so much better | We just got back from a trip down to SC | and I averaged 39 mpg 65 to 70 mph | I am tall and had no complaints about comfort | I even like the electric steering now that I am used to it | The one thing I do not like about it is the special tool I need to remove the oil filter for doing my own oil changes | 
 "words": My new Corolla S is exactly what I was looking for | Great looks nice interior and Toyota reliability | While some reviews on this car put is behind the competition I think the real points are missed | Let's face it people buy Toyota's for their reputation of being safe and reliable | This new Corolla is all that plus it looks great and is very comfortable | It is my third new Toyota and I hope I remain as happy with this car as my previous Toyotas | 
 "words": I traded in a 99 Mazda Protege for a Corolla LE | I wanted a reliable car that would last about 10 years without a lot of problems | I test drove a Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic and just felt safer in the Corolla | The car has adequate get up and go and has almost no wind noise on the freeway | The seats are very comfortable they are set higher up and give you a great view of the road while driving | The only distraction is the placement of the armrests too low on the door | The car has a great stereo and the placement of the interior features are perfect and very easy to use | Overall this is a great car for the money and comes with Toyota's reputation for reliability | 
 "words": I bought this as a second car for my wife because she wanted a reliable vehicle and opted for the Corolla | Now I wish I would have convinced her to buy a Civic | I just deplore the electric steering | No feel whatsoever | Highway passing is a venture in itself | I found myself adjusting in the lane because of a dead spot in the wheel | Reminded me of the old Chev truck my father drove back in the sixties | Terrible | Another thing is the ride | I hate it | All this is good for is going to the grocery store | Good thing it's only a few blocks away |
