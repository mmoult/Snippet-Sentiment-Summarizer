 "words": What can I say about this Car liked its Looks Drives goodbut has to many Design flaws | Exterior well look at top of door frames odd looking should have been higher glass taller fake window addition on rear panel | Interior Plastic sandpaper panels or Interior by biglots good layout Cheap Materials No GRAY INTERIORS BORING | DATED | The Sonota is such a better choice
 "words": Sebring is a great car | rides nice adequate power nice looking interior the light tan leather seats are wonderful | Exterior is also very nice fuel mileage is ranging from 23 city to 33 hwy with 4 passengers and junk in the trunk | This is a great car | 
 "words": We purchased the 09 Sebring Sedan Limited | It has all the options that are available | Unlike Edmund's review we found this car beautiful inside and out | The seats are soft leather | I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality | We have had several complements in regards to the style and accessories | Prior to this purchase we test drove six other cars | The Sebring was the most fun and best looking | It reminds me of a grown up Crossfire | The sound system is fantastic | The GPS radio CD Telephone are operated from a touch screen | Easy to learn | The V6 is responsive and fast enough | The gas mileage isn't as good as the Ford Focus but we are pleased with 27 mpg | 
 "words": I tested a number of cars including Camry Accord Ford Fusion Merc Milano Volvo S40and a couple more this was the smoothest quietest of all | There's a couple minor blips in the paint but car looks great with lots of leg room in the front | After driving a Mountaineer for the last 7 years it's like riding in a much larger luxury car and feels like a much bigger car | 
 "words":  the moment I saw the car I loved itI trade it with 1998 crown victhe total was less than 14000 | After I bought the carsI read many many bad things and revies about itbut I found out non of them trueand it's not fair for a good American made car | The warranty is unbelievablelife time on Engin and Transmitiongas mlg is more than greatthe design is wonderfulI read some reviews suggested poor built qualityI don't know about that yetthe car is new nowbut I am positive that many years to come will prove it's not true either | It's a good carwarth what I paid for
 "words": First-the bad news if you are looking to lay down 10 second runs at the track or turn heads at the valet then this isn't the car for you | That being said I challenge you to find a roomier more equipped more fuel efficient smoother riding vehicle than the '09 Sebring Sedan | Traded a clunker in w 200K miles and with all rebatesdiscounts ttf walked out the door with a 2 | 7 V6 Nav Sirius Sat Radio MyGig DVD System Power Sunroof Heated Power Seats Hot Cold Cup Holder Remote Start for 19K | Those same options on any other car puts you well over 30K all without the lifetime powertrain warranty | Put 100 miles on it the first day testing out the Navi | BTW I'm 6'4-
 "words": There was not a touring 2 | 7 listed but that is what I got and what a good motor for the car | I can't believe the gas mileage I am getting way better than listed | On the highway at 65 to 70 miles per hour I get 33 miles per gallon | It has all the bells and whistles some I will never use | It is comfortable for my wife and me to travel in | The motor is responsive for getting on and off the freeway and passing | The gas mileage is reasonable and we are averaging 28 miles per gallon | The radio sound is excellent for a car | We both like it | I have has the undecarage done rust inhibiters cloth stain proofed and paint protected | Now the car must respond | 
 "words": I have truly fallen for my sebring | Never had been a fan before having only experienced the convertibles in the past | It drives so smooth and has decent pick up | The look is sharp and it is very comfortable | I do feel it is simple in the interior department not many bells and whistles | Having said all of this I did not pay full price for it either | I was able to get it for under 14k during the cash for clunkers double rebate from Chrysler | I do not know if I would have paid 20k for it | Only time will tell | 
 "words": We've been blown away by the fuel economy | Highway has been 34 37 MPG while highway-city combined is around 28 MPG | We find it very comfortable to drive | 
 "words": I have the hardtop and I really have no complaints for the money you can't beat it 
 "words": i am over 6ft tall try to find a convertible that you can stretch out in and be comfortable at my height i previously owned 2 passats and there is a huge quality of interior sheet metaland paint difference but having said that it is very appealing to look at and gets great reviewns from passengers and onlookersjust don't look for a tight german ride | the car does everything well enough and the top comes downnothing better on a summer day
 "words": Great little car for the money | Ride is smooth and engine has a lot of get up and go | I was concerned after reading negative reviews but the car has grown on me | 
 "words": We bought this sedan after looking at and test driving Honda Accords Pontiac G6s Dodge Chargers | Despite what professional reviewers say this car has a great look on the outside and inside | The inside is kinda a art deco look and just feels | classy | the 4 cylinder is not going to slam you into the seats but it has respectable power and handling | If you are looking to buy American and get a good looking car that gets great gas mileage look no further | 
 "words":  I have driven both this model and the one it replaces and it seems the quality does down while the usability goes up | This is one of the worst cars I have ever driven and am ashamed to call it an American car | Chrysler should really think about doing the honorable thing and just putting itself and our taxes out of it misery | Drive quality F Confort F Build F | The plastic on the inside likes like it was spray painted with cheap rattle can paint and it chips off with a light fingernail | you need a phd to get the top down the heater is too hot or too cold | the seats are terrible and there is no back seat | Don't buy this car
