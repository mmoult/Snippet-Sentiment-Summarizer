REVIEWS
 "words": Haven't owned it long but so far more impressive than expected | Plenty of pep and super-quiet for the mondo freeway driving I do | Amazing fuel economy | Forget the EPA rating I get 34mpg in mixed driving with the AC on most of the time | Picked it up for less than 11000 with AC CD and auto included | Lots of room both front and back seats | Yes the exterior and interior are simple plain vanilla | I like that | pragmatism rules | And I'll agree that this is less solidly made than a Toyota | But for 5000 less well worth it | The lack of ABS though is shameful | All cars should have ABS standard these days | law should require it | CU gives good reliability ratings | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle this past June so wanted to give it time before passing judgement | The peace of mind of having such a great warranty is priceless and the added value of such a good MPG vehicle getting 29 to 34 was an important factor | The controls are in easy reach and the vehicle drives very comfortably | The interior is spacious and overall very pleasant to drive | I purchased the gold color with black and tan interior which gives off a mature but stylish feel to the vehicle | I never thought I would say this but so far this vehicle from Kia is a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": This was my first ever new off the show room floor car | in years past I averaged only 9000 miles a year driving | I've put over 15000 on my Kia in its first year | the Mileage is great1 i'm getting from 28 to 30MPG combined city and freeway | I commute 15 miles each way to work mostly freeway | good power great profile in the looks dept | interior is well thought out and the engine compartment is not all crowded and packed | you can see where everything is | I will drive this car when I'm on call for work on the weekends rather than one of our beat up company vehicles | 
 "words": This is my very first car and I know I made a great choice | It takes less than 25 to fill up my tank and I am good for the rest of the week | The interior is comfortable and I get compliments on the exterior | For a first car or something that in inexpensive and good to drive get this car | It is also roomy for my family of four | 
 "words": I was skeptical at first and concerned that i might not get 30 mpg | Have only had short time but first fill up 29 | 5 mpg and second fill up 32 | 2 mpg in mixed driving | Drives very smooth and handles well and looking forward to great mpg once it breaks in | 
 "words": This car saved my life along with three passengers when a drunk driver crossed into our lane | Its responsive handling allowed us to avoid a head-on collision and the side-airbags minimized the seriousness of our injuries | Everyone in the accident thanked me for choosing this car after putting its safety to the test | 
 "words": I traded in a Suburban for a Spectra so the shock value alone took some getting used to | Overall this is a great little car | Mechanically engineered well great gas mileage I averaged 34mpg the first weekend 300 miles of mixed use looks pretty decent parked next to a Nissan or Toyota | The carpet is more like some sort of fuzzy cardboard we'll see how the rest of the interior holds up over the next 3-4 years | Overall for the price I don't think you can beat this car in terms of warranty safety features and performance | Sticker on mine was 17250 drove away for 10K after trading in a 1996 Suburban with 230K miles | Yeah I keep them for a long time | 
 "words": This is a new purchase | I was able to get the Copperhead color so the car looks sharp it has fog lights and a rear spoiler | Before you laugh at the spoiler I was cruising the I-10 at 105 mph this engine was up to the task | At 85 mph below the cabin noise was minimal | I took some local back roads and the suspension was solid and the car felt glued to the road even as I took the curves at a goodly amount of speed | The brakes bring the car to a quick stop with no spongy fade | I look forward to taking my new Spectra on a long road trip to visit family in TN | The 700 mile journey will allow me to wring this car out see if it holds up for the 11 hour drive | 
 "words": Looking for an inexpensive new car | Look no further | I just purchased the Spectra and couldn't be happier | Great warranty fun to drive and comfortable compaired to my SUV the gas guage doesn't move | Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and the Kia network of services | 
 "words": No flaws | everything works as advertised | Looking forward to my first long-distance RoadTrip in this car | 
 "words": Just purchased my first Kia and my first new car ever drove it off the lot with 40 miles on the clock | I now have just over 1000 miles on the car over the last 3 weeks | The car has mostly been used for city driving my 35 mile R T drive to work | So far I am very happy with the car | The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in | One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance | The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out | I love all the storage compartments in the car | The stereo is not bad for a stock system and I love my sunroof | 
 "words": Our son crashed the family Ford Explorer | Used cars were high-priced | We decided to buy a Kia Spectra EX 4 door sedan for about 1500 more than it would have cost to get a 2005 used Explorer | Of course we got a red one | I'm a car buff and this is one nice vehicle | Great gas mileage averages over 28 mpg in mixed driving peppy pick up smooth ride plenty of cupholders | The car came loaded with options AC automatic headlights extra 12 volt chargersand even an iPod port | Safety ratings on this car rival those of Toyota and Honda and exceed those of the Ford Focus | All for about 14000 including delivery tax and license fees | I love it | 
 "words": Just bought my first Kia | Usually as a workhorse we go with Hyundai same company now Love the Spectra5 | The dealer was easy to work with and after 40 years of buying cars I had a good experience | I would recommend the buying experience alone but the car also | 
 "words": This car handles the curves on the road very well | The gas mileage is excellent | I think it's even better than the Ford Focus | I like the fact that it has a sporty look | The spoiler is a great addition | I needed a car check out the dealership and price and rode off into the sunset with a brand new vehicle | 
 "words": Purchased this car to drive to school 260 miles round trip four days a week | It gets 36-38 mpg and rides surprisingly well | Good build quality especially for the price | Never owned a kia before but if the quality of this car is indicative for the rest of their line I see an Amanti in my very near future | 
 "words": As you approach this car it seems like a fairly handsome vehicle | It has clean lines just a nice amount bling to it | Climb in and start going and you will quickly be disappointed | The wind noise is horrendous | That's ok though you can get used to it after a while and the stereo can be turned up loud enough to overcome the noise | No the worst part about this car is that in 2009 a car still has ABS as an option | What are they thinking | You get side airbags but I'd rather avoid an accident by having ABS | 
 "words": I have waited to write this for a few months because everyone loves their new car in the first couple of weeks | Four months later still finding that I love to drive this car | The styling of the Spectra 5 sticks out from others | Very affordable to operate and the features for the money are great | Never looked at a KIA before this purchase but will look there first for the next one | 
 "words": I waited 5 months to write this review because I wanted time to adjust to the car | Overall its a good value for the money | I also test drove the Corolla and Civic but the low price and excellent warranty is the reason I chose the Spectra | Handling is responsive and the car meets my needs very well | 
 "words": After comparing prices on the '07 to the new '09 KIA Spectra EX I decided to go with the '09 mainly based on price and having full warranty | I give this car straight 9s across the board | very happy with my purchase so far | I have even used the roadside service because I left my lights on and ran my battery dead | Called kia and they sent someone with no problems and limited info | They even called me back to make sure someone came to help | Will buy a KIA again | 
 "words": My previous car was an 03 Focus | The Spectra is much more zippy in acceleration yet has the same size engine as the Focus | And fuel economy is 20 percent better | I like how spacious the engine compartment is in terms of accessibility to hoses belts battery etcetera | These items are easy to see and inspect | And replacement when necessary should not be difficult | What I miss about the Focus is the softer seats | The Kia seats are are quite rigid | What I have a concern about is the cable actuated gas cap door | Cables and plastic latches fail in cold climates | I may have to improvise a better system to insure I can refuel in the winter | 
 "words": I have personally been watching this car for 3 years | I'm glad I waited to buy after the 2008 model year | Kia has improved the styling tremendously by getting rid of a lot of the plastic skirting | This car has a clean appearance | The five spoke wheels are a plus over the old eight spoke alloys | This car is a hoot to drive especially with the stick | The engine has good low end torque | Regardless of what you read or hear about this car I say if you're interested go test drive one | Personally I see me driving this car for more than 100000 miles |
