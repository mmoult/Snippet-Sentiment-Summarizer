REVIEWS
 "words": This 09 replaced our 2008 RAV | It is all it was billed to be | Love the nimbleness with the v6 | With the addition of the KN air filter we get 24 | 8 city and 26 on the highway | 
 "words": After one month I am very pleased with my purchase of the 4cyl as the 6cyl seemed way too much for such a light vehicle | The 4cyl is smoother when accelerating and powerful enough when needing to pass on the highway | The leather seats are nicely cushioned in the front but the rear seats are much more firm making long trips surely less comfortable | I notice some road noise when traveling on the Interstate but with the radio on I barely hear it | The ride is tremendous as the suspension absorbs bumps well | Cargo space is awesome including the hidden compartment for added space | Even with JBL upgrade FM radio reception is still just okay but XM satellite reception is much better | 
 "words": I have had this Rav4 for almost 2 weeks | It's a Base V6 4wd | The first tank of gas gave me an avg mileage 24 mpg for a combination of Highway and City | Ride quality feels solid but engine noise is very evident for the first few gears and once we pick up speed 40 miles you can hardly hear a hum | I chose the Rav4 over CRV just because it offers a v6 option and Honda doesn't | I am hoping 270 Hp coupled with 4wd should suffice to drive on hilly and snowy winters | 
 "words": We decided on a vehicle that allows the wife to enter exit a higher driving position car | She finds getting in and out of the smaller Rav4 easier on her hip bursitis | We took the Rav4 for its first long vacation trip putting a total of 1590 miles on the vehicle | We averaged over 28mpg | The Rav4 handled in a predictable and well mannered fashion but when rolling over rough pavement you know you are not riding in a sedan | Some road noise was also evident at slow speeds possibly due to the larger 17 steel wheels that came with the Value Pkg | The wife found the Rav4 a bit better to her driving sense than the CRV we test drove | The only complaint so far is the audio system muffled | 
 "words": From the moment I had this thing on the road I loved it | Very fast very good 4 wheeled discs excellent handling and gotta love the bluetooth | Never got the MPG as stated | City 16 combined 20 MPG but I have a lead foot and love the twisty's | This is the first car that I have owned that the word 'launch' actually applies | 
 "words": This car has great gas mileage handling performance style | Forget the frills the Chevy equinox has and buy with confidence | When I purchased the car the dealer said see you first oil change | To my surprise that was the only time I needed the service dept | I own 3-5 vehicles for years and this is the first where I did not become friends with service adviser fixing warranty problems | My son and daughter got rid of their Chevy and Pontiac and they are glad they did also | My gas mileage is 24 to work and 28 on trips | 
 "words": Lets start with the ugly | Road noise is high if you do not like road noise then do not buy this car | Very loud on anything but smooth pavement | 
 "words": Averaging 28 mpg | RAV4 reminds me of a Corolla I had for a loaner for a month | Similar driving dynamics lots of road noise booming exhaust | In the morning the tranny has an annoying 2-stage takeoff from park it engages 3 4's then full lock even when rolling | Once warmed up the hiccup goes away | Although the interior dashboard is not as cleverly designed as a CRV not enough cubby compartments the center armrest console is a welcome feature | The rear side doors have only a molded cup holder for a small H2O bottle | The back door is a disappointment too | Just a fishnet and no cubby holes molded in the door like the CRV | Audio loudness feature is good because of the road noise | 
 "words": We needed a vehicle with a large enough rear seat for a child seat and an infant seat and easy to get the kids in and out of | This RAV-4 is the perfect choice | This vehicle seems small on the outside but it has unbelievable space inside | The cargo area without 3rd row seats is huge and the 2 storage bins under the floor are a bonus | Rear seats truly fold flat unlike many others | This one is a V6 Limited with all options except navigation | This thing is very fast and the fuel economy is pretty amazing | We get 24-25mpg on local driving and we've seen 32 mpg on the road | A very versatile vehicle for an active family | 
 "words": Bought Sport version because I wanted a black interior Limited not available in cloth | Dealer Salesperson indicated slightly tighter and slightly harsher ride | Also indicated that suspension was somewhat programmable if really needed | Term harsher was understated | Can't keep coffee from spilling on local access roads and can't program suspension according to dealer's service dept | Took on trip to NYC ride on highway OK not fatiguing | Ride in NYC would have been smoother in a horse buggy | Noise Handling and overall Fuel MPG are really better than I expected | Only clear fault is the Spare Tire Carrier | Quality of fit is unsatisfactory and this quirk will haunt you forever | 
 "words": Just returned from a trip from New York to Rhode Island with my brand new RAV4 4-cylinder was not sure whether to buy the 4 or 6 cylinder and did much research as well as test drives on both | Got caught up in all the Cash for Clunker garbage and purchased the 4 | I am normally a bit heavy on the pedal and this baby did not let me down | No problem whatsoever | She was a rocket plenty of nerve | I had test driven the V6 good but no need for such a large hsp engine in such a light vehicle | Save your | Vehicle was tops in every meaning of the word and I am very picky an excellent driving experience | Cheers to Toyota | 
 "words": We own a generation 1 rav4 and have nearly 250000 miles on it | We have a baby on the way and needed more room for a car seat | We test drove a few other makes and models and ultimately decided to buy a new rav4 | I really enjoy the peppy 4cyl engine and the decent gas mileage | I am 6'1 tall and find the front leg room to be a bit lacking | Also the new rav4 doesn't brake as well as our old rav4 | However the new rav4 turns easier and maneuvers better | I miss being able to park in the tiniest spaces but hey now we have room for a stroller groceries and a car seat | I would recommend a 2009 rav4 to anyone looking for a small SUV that is lots of fun to drive | 
 "words": It is a genuine fun easy to drive vehicle | Well made and just only two items were defective but Toyota taking care of problems | 
 "words": Have enjoyed owning and driving the RAV 4 | Interior road noise is difficult to get used to and radio sound system is not as good as I had hoped it would be | Also the first time I went through a car wash touchless the tire cover came completely off and was damaged scratched | This cover had never been removed for any reason during my ownership According to dealer this has happened to ONE other RAV 4 | Also tire cover not covered under warranty according to dealer | 
 "words": After looking at Ford Edge and other products the quality could not compare to Toyota | The performance handling with 23mpg for a V-6 is outstanding | I have towed 1500 lbs | of rock with a trailer and it was like nothing was there | I owned a 95 Nissan Pathfinder 17mpg before this and what a great replacement | I do not need the ground clearance like I had before because this is mainly for traveling cross-country | I have packed 350 lbs of dirt in the back with no problems | I purchased this RAV4 to keep for the next 10 years and I believe it will service me well | I received more incentives than any of the other dealerships had to offer before cash for clunkers came out | Plus a military discount | 
 "words": The 2009 Toyota RAV4 drives very smoothly has a lot of pep for a 4 cyl and great visibility | I don't like driving in general and takes me a while to get used to a car but I felt very at-ease with this car right from the beginning | 
 "words": Vehicle did not make transaxle noise when purchased | After 1500 miles it started a howling noise at light throttle 35-55 mph it is getting worse Toyota Tech is supposed to be checking on the reason for it it has been 21 days and I have heard nothing I am very dissatisfied with this car | I was told there was a production change I think I got one of the bad ones | The service dept | replaced an axle at about 5 thousand miles and the axle bearing but this did not correct the noise I am hearing | 
 "words": Very nice car improvement over my 2003 Subaru Forester | Others have noted the stiffness of the seats but my wife I like that and have noticed that seats are starting to feel 'softer' with more use | The interior is designed well but the materials are budget | I'm getting between 25 26 MPG in overall use | some stop go plus some highway | Very happy with my RAV4 | 
 "words": I drove an '06 Sr5 4Runner prior to the Rav4 | and how I miss it | The Rav4 is cute | not really meant to be an off-road vehicle | The v6 is quick but the engine does whine slightly | I expect my MPG will increase as I only have 800 miles on the SUV 21 combined currently | Styling does need an upgrading and is expected in 2012 | Some interior features need more strategic placement | 
 "words": I have put on almost 10000 miles | ACTUAL mileage for every drop of gasoline in town and on highway is 21 | 9 MPG | Have the V6 4WD Limited with all the bells and whistles | This car is a rocket with lots of power and great handling | Silver Classic color is gorgeous | 
 "words": One of the more practical vehicles on the road the 2009 Rav4 offers efficient packaging two competent engines and enough safety and convenience to satisfy just about everyone | If you had to choose only one vehicle to transport a family haul furniture and find its way through inclement weather this compact to mid-size SUV is tough to beat | There is some comfort loss in exchange for space especially in the rear seat | The cushions are rather flat and don't provide much support so make sure those that will inhabit the space take a test ride | Road and wind noise isn't in the luxury class but it is livable especially when you consider the relatively light weight of the vehicle vs | the size | 
 "words": If you didn't know this was a four cylinder vehicle you wouldn't know by its performance | It has far more useful extras even in the base model I have than any of the competitors | It also has more storage hidden accessible and functional storage all three | The tailgate is easy to open and the drive is smooth for an SUV except at extremely low speeds under 20 mph and even then not bad | I love this car and am glad I chose it | Fuel economy seems to be greater so far than specified on the government websites | Seats are extremely easy to fold up and they fold up flat and low better than any other model I looked at and I looked at a lot of them | This is important as I have dogs | 
 "words": Once I decide to trade in my car I wanted something with more cargo than my Nissan Altima | My first choice was the new Mazda 3 5 doors | While doing my research I came across the Toyota Rav4 | It rates the same MPG but has more cargo space about the same price and looks way better | Reading reviews and comparing all the competitors I chose the 2009 Toyota RAV4 | It has the power 4 cyl it has the looks no cheap black plastic going around the bumper and the Toyota Reputation | It rides nice quiet and firm | Driving in the city so far I got 26 | 2 mpg and still going up | I can't wait to see how much I get at our road trip to the north | 
 "words": We purchased our new Rav4 two weeks ago | I love it | One thing I did notice was that when I was driving on the highway and opened just the two back windows and not the front the interior of the auto sounded like a freight train | It was very loud and the pressure actually hurt my ear drums | 
 "words": After months of research test drives the RAV4 won out for several reasons | It really is fun to drive well laid out has super comfy seats and my tall husband can fit without knocking his head off | The only negative is the front seat headrests | They are extremely uncomfortable for someone with neck problems | However I popped mine out turned it around and the problem was solved | Hopefully there will be an aftermarket option | 
 "words": It's exhilarating driving this car as the acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder engine | It gets great gas mileage on the highway-about 35 mpg averaging about 25-26mpg with mixed driving | The car is a little noisy on the highway but with music on its not noticeable | The interior could be better but for a base model its pretty good when compared to the forester or the CRV | Also not to mention the brawlik exterior look if gotten in black | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle under the Clunkers Program while donating my Ford F-150 to the government for destruction | The mpg is great with new four cylinder engine | EPA figures are either on the money or slightly low | Plenty of pep too | Very quiet even at highway speeds | Great looking interior | The V6 would have been nice but absolutely not necessary unless you're carrying six or towing a boat | Same goes for AWD here in Florida but in snow country I would have added AWD | This could be a more ideal car for seniors as it is easy to drive and easy to get in and out of | The swing out trunk lid is easier for seniors than the hatch | Same for getting things out of the back | No stooping | 
 "words": When I bought this vehicle I knew that the V6 gave it a lot of power | Wow was I surprised the first time I passed another car on the highway | The Rav4 has scary fast power | With the sport suspension the Rav4 handles great also | Don't even think about buying the under-powered competitors | 
 "words": I had previously owned two Corolla's and loved both of them | I needed a bigger vehicle because of two new children | I test drove a Santa Fe a Highlander and a Rav4 | It took me about 5 minutes of driving a Rav4 to fall in love | I obviously like the added size and power | However what I find amazing with the Rav4 is I still feel like I'm driving my old Corolla | I'm also looking forward to the 4WD and added weight this winter | 
 "words": I absolutely love this car | I'm a research junkie and thoroughly reviewed and test drove the Honda CRV Kia Sportage Mitsubishi Outlander Ford Escape Subaru Forrester and Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe | The RAV4 blew them all away | My last car was a BMW 5-series with all the bells and whistles so I was a little worried about making the adjustment to a non- luxury SUV | However this car has continued to impress me with its easy handling roomy interior reliability features appearance comfortable seats and gas mileage | I have read a few of the negative reviews and I really think that we must be driving completely different makes models | My RAV4 has been fantastic | 
 "words": Hi folks | I wanted to update you since my last report | We just got back from 2350 mile trip Calif Arizona Colorado Nevada | The 4 cyl climbed up 8700 ft mountains no sweat | 29 | 1 MPG 75-80mph | Yes I did down shift a couple of times but no prob | Oh my brakes got better as they were mushy before | Dealer checked breaks OK before trip | I really enjoyed the trip and the car | 
 "words": Maybe because I had a Nissan XTerra prior to my RAV4 I feel like the RAV4's driving experience is very much like a car not an SUV which is fantastic and there's no 'truck-like' feeling | The cornering is fairly tight for an SUV and the acceleration is phenomenal with the V6 | I have no problem zipping into small spaces | I love the fuel economy too averaging 22 | 5 mpg in Central NJ | The keyless entry ignition is so so so convenient and awesome too | 
 "words": After driving a V8 powered 4Runner for longer than I should have I needed to find a better MPG for my commute | The Rav4 was a pleasant surprise | I never thought I would fall in love with a small SUV | The ride is smooth yet powerful with the V6 engine | I'm averaging 23mpg which is a big step up over the 15 I was getting before | Handling is superb although the electronic assisted steering takes some getting used to | At 6'1 space is an issue for me and I have plenty in the Rav4 | I have a ton of shoulder leg and head room and the storage bins under the cargo area are a nice feature | My road bike fits with ease with the seats folded down | I highly recommend the Rav4 | 
 "words": I leased a red Canadian built RAV 4 with the V6 | This vehicle provides phenomenal power styling comfort and economy | On the highway the RAV is ultra smooth especially between 65 and 70mph 110 to120k hr | The interior is extremely spacious with plenty of headroom and lots of storage | I recommend the 270 horsepower V6 | Amazing acceleration however great fuel economy | I chose the flashy red exterior for a sporty look | This is the best crossover SUV in its class | I highly recommend this vehicle | Thank you | 
 "words": I just bought this vehicle a week ago and so far I like it | Low road noise compared to my old Civic and the seats are MUCH more comfortable I can't feel the springs beneath the fabric like I could with the Civic even when it was new | Steering not as tight as I'd like | I like that it has the height of a truck with the feel of a car | My elderly father can get in with minimal step-up and can get out very easily | 
 "words": The RAV4 provides an elevated driving position good and adaptable carrying capacity and a comfortable ride | Economy so far has been very good at 24 MPG in suburban driving near 30 MPG on the highway | 
 "words": I have owned my RAV4 for only three weeks but I feel it is a vehicle that I will keep for many years | I love nearly every aspect of the vehicle from the power of the six cylinder engine to the ease of handling | There's plenty of storage area and ease of accessing materials | The quality of the materials appears to be excellent I have perforated leather and heated seats | The smart key entry is wonderful since I just leave my keys in my pocket for entry and starting the vehicle | I do not find the swing door on the back to be a problem at all as it opens widely for easy access | The rear step bumper is also handy | To conclude I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend the RAV4 | 
 "words": Our family decided on the 2009 Limited RAV4 after the first test drive | We were impressed with a quiet smooth and comfortable ride | We also enjoyed the extra space the vehicle provided | We doubted the gas mileage ratings but after 2 months we believe | We live in a rural area of PA and are getting 28 mpg | On our first 12 hour trip we got close to 30 mpg | We find the leather seats very comfortable and enjoy the bluetooth phone capabilities | no more worries about getting the phone up to the ear | Keyless entry is nice but can be confusing | I researched just about every available source and they all pointed to this vehicle | Limited with leather is more comfortable than the Base | 
 "words": Had a hard time deciding between the 4x4 Toyota Rav4 and the 4x4 Honda CRV | Test drove both vehicles and Toyota won by features performance and price | Honda has a smaller cabinet and smaller engine lacking performance | As far as price I was quoted similar price on both vehicle but Toyota now includes the Extra Convenience Package which includes 17 Steel 5 Spoke Style wheels Privacy Glass Roof Racks and Floor Mats as for the same | 
 "words": We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains and the combination of very steep roads and snow ice is challenging | We had to have 4WD and seating for six but we wanted good mileage too | After two years of reviewing cars we got a RAV4 | The V6 eats up mountains without straining the transmission | There's a bit of a 'turbo' lag as the transmission gears down but then the RAV4 jumps past cars when passing | Same engine as the Highlander in a much lighter SUV | Wow | Backdoor and wheel are same as on our Jeep | not a big issue for us | Where else could the full-size spare go | Having a full-size spare is important | Only complaints mileage is not as good as we want and steering not as tight | 
 "words": Leased this car for my kid | The transmission shifts and sounds like a cement mixer | The interior is wall-to- wall plastic with no soft areas | The push button glove box is kind of quirky and small | The center console that houses the radio looks and feels like something from a K-Mart appliance center | The fuel filler door is riveted on and has the feeling it is going to be pulled off if too much pressure is exerted | Car is relatively slow | I should have leased the Jeep Patriot or Ford Escape | RAV4 is acceptable but certainly not anything that is above the others including the domestics | This is the last Toyota I will purchase | 
 "words": It is fun to drive this car sSUV | The gas mileage is good | The layout of the temperature controls are good but the control for the audio is a bit high or out of reach | 
 "words": Only had this thing a few weeks now and it is awesome | Traded in an 07 Highlander which I also loved except for its interior finish | After 2 tanks of gas I am averaging about 26 mpg with mixed highway and city driving in the RAV | Gas mileage going down the interstate is best when I cruise at 65-70 mph | To me and my wife there was not a huge difference between the 4 and 6 cylinder models performance and as such we did not want to fork over the extra cash | The interior on the Sport is far nicer than the base model for not much more money | The only thing I wouldn't mind having is the 4x4 as our Highlander was AWD and that worked great in bad weather | Overall very happy with the RAV | 
 "words": My husband researched all SUVs in this size range the Rav4 seemed to come out tops in most areas | With 2 small kids we were truly looking for a used Pilot or Highlander for 3rd row | But with my 05 Forester lease coming due we ran out of time finding what we wanted in our price range | So I decided on a 3 yr lease of a Rav4 Limited and I AM SO HAPPY | I've only had it for 3 days but at least at this point I could totally see myself buying it at the end of the lease | It's comfortable roomy handles wonderfully and is lovely to look at | Went with Pyrite Mica color with gray leather love it | I was concerned about comfort but with the pwr lumber it's great | Average 24 mpg so far | 
 "words": The V6 engine has great performance | Quiet engine | Fun to drive easy to park | I like the controls and fold down seats | Good gas mileage 23 25 town 27 29 highway | I am very disappointed in the ride it is more like a truck not smooth at all | Also the headrest are not comfortable | 
 "words": My BMW 330i was fun solid and hugely expensive to maintain | I researched many options and while looking at an FJ Cruiser the salesperson suggested a RAV4 | I was surprised at the V6 performance and handling was also unexpected | I loaded it up and chose the Limited because of the heated leather seats | The outside spare was not an issue because I was looking at an FJ | The center dash stack is space ship like and the gauges don't all read top of dial for normal | I'm 6ft 3in | and I can wear a cap with the sunroof | This is a very comfortable car with deceptive interior room and storage space and it is kinda fun to drive | Got the extended warranty and waved good bye to 1000 repairs | 
 "words": After looking at all the small SUVs it became apparent that there's really no serious contender for the Toyota | I was actually leaning towards the Honda CR-V when I first started looking but the Toyota won me over with its better gas mileage and roomier interior | A lot of thought went into laying out the interior and build quality was very good | I wasn't too sure how a 4 cylinder engine mated to an automatic transmission would perform but it has more than enough power for daily driving although I still would have liked to have a manual transmission | Unfortunately being best in class comes at a higher price tag | Total out the door cost for a sport package was 23 | 5K as of June 2009 | 
 "words": This is car is horrible | I get it free through work-otherwise I would never voluntarily purchase one | It's uncomfortable poorly designed and has a rough ride | The interior looks cheap and has asinine places for cup holders | The fact that this car has a keyless ignition is in my opinion a nightmare | I find myself losing the keys like crazy because there's no specific spot for them | The rav also has a very jerky ride to it-not so great when riding with passengers who suffer from car sickness | The back door opens outward as opposed to upward-another stupid feature for obvious reasons | I could go on and on but to sum it up it's awful | 
 "words": I have to say that I am very pleased with this vehicle | I am 6ft 2in and fit comfortably with plenty of leg and head room | The vehicle offers a quiet smooth ride with minimal engine noise | I have read the digs that it is noisy the engine is weak etc | Baloney | The RAV4 performs admirably when compared to most any vehicle in its class | And I have compared about 6 of its competitors | My combined mileage with less than 1000 miles 2 3 highway and 1 3 city is 28 | 2 | No kidding | I am pretty conservative-but this purchase was all about comfort style reliability and mileage | I have them all | 
 "words": My wife and I researched for over 2 months for the right vehicle for us | With a large breed dog that travels will us frequently we needed the cargo space and the low loading dock | We got everything we asked for in the cargo space and the handles to put the rear seats down was one of the features we love the most | The V6 has tons of power | We test drove the 4Cyl also which has plenty of power as well but was just a bit too noisy | I wouldn't say the seats are uncomfortable but without a power seat I'm still trying to find the right position | There seems to be SO much space all around | And the rear seats that fold flat make it all that much better | Love my Rav | 
 "words": This car suv is outstanding | Easy to drive park and get in and out of | It has the power I need without sacrificing gas mileage | I love it | 
 "words": The driver seat and the front passenger seat are very uncomfortable | Probably the worst I experienced in a car | The car performs great but I hate to drive it because of the seat | 
 "words": Great car | I have only had it 3 weeks but I am impressed good | My other vehicle is F-150 V-8 but this little 4 banger 4 cyl really has the power I can't imagine a V-6 in this thing | It only has about 870 miles so far but it really goes fast I have to watch my speed to keep it under 70 mph | We took the car over to the coast to break in the engine | Up hill and down around sharp curves it was great power was right there better than my F-150 V-8 | Gas mileage is outstanding | on our road trip to the coast and back freeways at 70-80 | my average is 28 | 1 mpg | I could not believe it | The only bad thing is the brakes | You really have to push the brake pedal hard when coming to a stop sign | 
 "words": We compared CRV RDX and RAV4 | The styling and performance of the CRV was less than stellar | The RDX was really cramped feeling in both head and legroom with just OK performance | The RAV4 has much more room and comfort I'm 6'2 | The V6 is quick and smooth and we are getting around 20 mpg city | I have seen comments of the RAV being noisy or the seats not comfortable | Don't find that at all | This Sport with appearance pkg | and leather seats is quiet and comfortable almost making you forget it's a SUV and I am a nitpicker | 
 "words": I've been driving my new Rav for about a month now and I'll admit I've been surprised in both good and bad ways Good With 4cyl Incredible gas mileage | I average 30mpg interstate with cruise control going 65mph If I go up to 72mph I drop to around 24 25mpg so the trick is to keep it slow | Additionally I can get a solid 34mpg doing 55mph on more rural travels | I also use the aux jack constantly with my MP3 player don't know how I went 9 years without one | We had aftermarket heated seats installed in the cloth seats nice in Pennsylvania | Bad The cloth seats are NOT comfortable sure they could be worse i | e | Subaru but it may be worthwhile to go for leather | 
 "words": I recently purchased a 2009 RAV4 and love everything about it except the seats and head rests | The seats have very little support and the head rests tilt so far forward my neck hurts every time I drive | I have read many complaints about the uncomfortable seats and head rests and don't understand why Toyota can't change them | I won't buy another Toyota until these features are changed | 
 "words": The V6 on this little SUV jumps and accelerates well | Coming from a standard 5-speed 4x4 Pathfinder it's taking me a little getting used to the auto tranny lag time on the gas pedal | But the power is very impressive once engaged | The ride is very smooth | Has reduced noise compared to my CRV | The tapered cabin provides more space to the front seats than you'd think | Haven't tested it off road yet but soon | 
 "words": My initial choice was Honda CRV but after test driving it I found it was a bit noisy and sluggish pickup | I rented 2008 Rav4 and driven it on Highway from Atlanta GA to Memphis TN and found it stable between 75 to 95 MPH but just under powered and little louder | Finally decided to buy 2009 Rav4 2WD I4 as it has a refined engine Dual VVTi with more fuel economy and power | I wanted to buy a vehicle which fits in my budget and able to drive to work and also long trips with space for Cargo | I did not go for a V6 269 hp as I4179 hp is sufficient and I don | t want to get more speeding tickets with V6 | My previous car was Camry V6 | 
 "words": We replaced My wife's 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee with our new RAV4 | We live in the Hills in Connecticut and our 2 | 5L 4-cyl climbs the hills very well so much better then our previous Jeep | Handling is superb | Gas mileage has been averaging 22 | 5 mpg which is a little bit disappointing | Would highly recommend the mud guards which are about 58 | 00 at dealers cost | They prevent road grime being tossed up the side of the vehicle | Also they are easy to install | Overall this vehicle is a great buy for the money | 
 "words": We purchased our Rav 4 in Febuary and so far so good | Typical Toyota quality | Snow ice and now mud doesn't slow this baby down | Although it's not a hardcore 4X4 it does the job | I'd buy another one tomorrow | 
 "words": The sport package with the V-6 was the clincher | The i-4 is more than adequate but the 6 is in a different league | quiet smooth and very quick | The Rav looks better in sports wear as opposed to the Limited's formal attire | No spare tire on the back of the Sport V-6 is a big plus run flat tires maybe not so much | we'll see | I've never been crazy about the dash and they're a little stingy w options | Fit and finish are great and Toyota reliability is tough to beat | 
 "words": There is no worse feeling than taking the plunge and realizing you made a mistake | It took me 3 days to realize I married the wrong man but only ONE to regret buying this car | The Rav4 is cute with that snappy little 4 cylinder engine with good gas mileage | However the poor design of the interior rains on my parade | The front seats are flat and tilted down leaving me to slip off at every turn | The head rests eat into my head | The sound system is so poor it muffles human voices on am radio | Entertainment and temperature controls are too poorly lit to see in sunglasses | There is no way to hold the tiny steering wheel comfortably and no arm rests | Cheap fabric tops off the look | 
 "words": I am the not so proud owner of a 2009 Rav4 | At 131km it had its first visit to the shop with the A T Oil indicator light illuminated | It took three more trips to the shop to fix the problem | Now at 3000km it is back in the shop with AWD slip control and engine indicator lights on | It has also failed to start and down shifts with the grace of a new driver in a standard transmission car | I am getting absolutely no help from Toyota Canada or the dealer that I bought this lemon from | The only nice thing about this car is the paint job | 
 "words": This new SUV is indeed fun to drive | I couldn't wait each day to drive it | 4 cycler engine still has enough power making acceleration sharp | So everything is good except for one thing too noisy when accelerating | I found the noise is not coming from engine but from poor insulation or design of exhaust system | I recommend the manufacture should recall to replace this noisy system with quite one | I feel strongly that once this noise issue is solved the RAV4 4X4 base model can be the best selling SUV in the world and people will love it even more | Sincerely hope the manufacturer will listen to our voices | 
 "words": I decided give a try for RAV4 after good experience with my wife Siena08 | 2009 RAV4 is very roomy and I bought a full load Limited | My previous experience was a much heavier LR Discovery V8 and RAV4 performer better thanks to light body and very well designed transmission | The interior everything are very well resolved but the material looks cheaper even leather trim is not first class | There are excessive noise in cabin combined from engine and road | Update combined millage is 21mpg not bad for a I-4 AWD but I don't think I'll get promised 27mpg freeway |
