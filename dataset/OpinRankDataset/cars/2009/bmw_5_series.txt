REVIEWS
 "words": this is our 3rd bmw previously owned an 07 convertible 07 7series | there is alot to luv and enjoy about this car | comfort ride luxury all in one package | standouts are the sports mode pkg kit signature silver color | hd radio stands out immediately more car companies should offer it | 
 "words": Just turned in my leased '07 530xi for an '09 535i | Almost cried as the '07 was simply an exceptional car | If it weren't for the very high buyout I would have purchased the car | Found a new 535i with sport pkg nav cold weather etc for an absolute steal | The changes from '07 are wonderful better leather the sport seats are thrones and they seemed to have fixed the noisy moonroof issue | Not that the '07 was underpowered but the '09 just flies | 80 comes up quickly and its really hard to obey the owner's manual to keep it under 100 during breakin | Car is very quiet even with the sport package and the ride is as supple if not more than the 530xi non-sport | Hope to keep this car | 
 "words": Test drove the 528i and fell in love | My husband also wanted to try out the X5 | it was nice but the handling wasn't as good as the 5series | So I've been driving my 528i for only a few weeks now but am in LOVE with it | I got the Premium and Sport packages | The 20-way seat feels like it hugs my body | Haven't used the heated seats yet in the Florida summer but look forward to trying them out if we have a cold winter | This is the smoothest quietest ride I've ever had and great acceleration | I love the i-drive | it did take a little getting used to but the learning curve wasn't long and well worth it | 
 "words": This is my first BMW | It's incredibly comfortable and fun to drive | Great performance stability and luxury | Very quiet ride so I can hear the music clearly on radio or CD when put on low volume | 
 "words": Just purchased the 535i xDrive and absolutely love it | It handles curves like no other sedan in its class | Really have to pay attention to my speed because of smooth ride | Fuel economy isn't bad for 300 horses and vehicle weight currently getting 25 to 27 highway but still in break-in period | Very comfortable interior with lots of room | Could use a little more storage but not a major issue the golf clubs fit fine | I do agree that the cup holders are ridiculous | 
 "words": I've owned this car for about 2 months and just returned from my first road trip | It took a little getting used to its heft compared with the 3 Series it replaced but now that I'm used to that and the operation of the iDrive I really love the car | It's very smooth and comfortable and has deceptively great handling | I'm still in break in mode doing more stop- and-go and am getting about 27 mpg | The 5 Series is just a joy to drive puts a smile on my face every time I press that start button | 
 "words": Well it's been 4 years since I've owned a Beemer 02' 330i Conv | Sports have been in a 05' Mercedes CLK500 and 97'Porsche 911 Conv | It's great to own a Beemer again don't think I'll ever go back to a Merc quality was sub par although engine and power were amazing | Been driving my 535I sports package for the last couple of weeks and am extremely impressed I was worried that I would miss the power of my CLK500 but have been satisfied with my 535I twin turbo engine | Interior with black bamboo is fantastic this is the most comfortable car I have ever been in more than enough space and the contour seats are great | Overall handling is superb and the drive is smooth | Cabin is extremely quite | 
 "words": I didn't get the high end stereo package and it has really minimized my affection for the car | At 60k this stereo sounds similar to a much less expensive car | Shame on you BMW | 
 "words": First time BMW owner and love the car | Got the Nav Prem Ipod link SAT radio adaptive xenons and cold weather packages | Was looking at Hyundai Genesis Infiniti G35x but the BMW blew me away | I really can't wait to drive it | Very quiet and responsive 3 | 0l seems bigger and more powerful handling is superb and the ride is firm but very comfortable idrive is really very easy to use not sure why all the hubbub- just takes a bit of practice | If this sustains I will be a BMW guy for life | Winding and wet roads are life for me and the car sticks like glue | Fit and finish flawless | Very roomy for 4 | Not enough road time for economy rating yet | Stock sound system is very good | 
 "words": Leased on 535i with 6 spd premium sports and cod weather package | Took off the run flats and am storing them until the end of the lease | This is the 2nd BMW I have followed this ritual | Car handles like it is on rails | Performance is sooo sweet | Previously had a 530i with manual | The extra ponies 45 or so are noticeable and the torque comes on just above idle at 1400 and stays flat until about redline | I commute about 45 miles to work and this beemer makes going to work fun | Have had beemers since 2000 and they are the utmost fun to drive but run flats stink big time | BMW- please hear this run flats belong on a Lexus for those who don't want to change a tire in the rain | 
 "words": Traded in my E46 M3 after 6 years | Purchased a white 550i with Sport Cold Weather packages lots of other goodies | The car looks fabulous | the LED side rear lights and Angel Eye DRLs make the car unique and very attractive | The acceleration handling and fuel economy are comparable to my old M3 but without the nervousness | I've never purchased a car that gave me the satisfaction of ownership that I receive from my 550i | The whole automobile is a work of art from the anthracite tailpipes to the black front air intake | a study in black and white | The Sport Package makes the current 550i better and more modern looking than the 2010 version | 
 "words": I just bought this turned in my 07 and wow what a difference for only 2 years | You can notice a little more pickup the 07 525 was a real dog | The handling and suspension what can you say it's a BMW I told myself I'd buy a Genesis or try something new but for an enthusiast driver THERE IS NO COMPARISON TO THE FEEL OF A BMW this car is soo tight | 
 "words": Previous owner of 325 and 328xi coupe | On top of all the attributes of a 5-series much more comfortable interior quiet and luxurious ride but still that BMW feel and handling it gets better in-town gas mileage than the coupe | I got over worrying about I-drive and learned to enjoy it | 
 "words": This is my 4th BMW | Had an X5 325i 328xi and now 528i Xdrive | I always think I want something else | When it comes down to it nothing competes with the drive and handling of the BMW | Not Mercedes Jaguar Infinity etc and I have tried them all | Fun to drive and luxurious all at the same time | Gas mileage is not bad for the full size car | BMW definitely holds up to its slogan the Ultimate Driving Machine | 
 "words": Driven the car for just under 3000 miles and it's fantastic so far | Heated seats and steering wheel combined with X-Drive have been excellent during this active New England winter | Best driving car I've ever owned and interior annoyances lack of storage space cup holders are acceptable given the driving dynamics all-weather aplomb and overall content of the car | 
 "words": I am spoiled to BMWs | Each one seems to get better | My '09 528i is very solid | I had an '06 530i which got great mileage and I'm hoping this car will get better as I get more miles on it | The shifting is silky smooth and build quality is good | The improvements in the idrive are notable pushbuttons for CD Radio Telephone etc | It's a little pricey but it's worth a little more if you're enthusiastic about what you drive | 
 "words": Love the car overall | The acceleration leaves a lot to be desired | I am mystified by the cheap cup holders in the front seat | For 50000 I expect more | The car takes the road well | The new iDrive is much improved from years past | 
 "words": This was the best fun car in its class | I always look forward to drive this machine every day | Handles the sharp corners exceptionally well | It has pretty good MPG in city too | Overall am thrilled to have 300 horses it in my stable | 
 "words": I purchased my 3rd BMW and I am glad I did | I had not driven one for over a year and had forgotten why I keep going back | It just keeps getting better | My car has the sport and prem packages and well worth it | 
 "words": Just came off lease on X5 4 | 4 and considered X5 4 | 8 Porsche Cayenne S and A6 didn't like looks of E series but strong bias for Germans | Wanted sedan for performance and fuel mileage didn't need exhaust note of V8 or ridicule from wife over Porsche name plate | Needed all wheel drive for winter | So far this is the perfect car handles so much better than the best handling SUVs | Very responsive turbo lag only noticeable to extreme gearhead | Exterior is a little boring not as much as A6 so get some nice wheels | 
 "words": The 2009 535i with x drive is an incredible driving machine | This car with a 6 speed manual transmission is a monster to drive | The engine's power will be evident as soon as you put your foot down on the pedal | The navigation system has been upgraded with several short cut buttons surrounding the iDrive | It is a pleasure to use once you have been shown the basic functions | It is logical and easy to use | Since my 535i xDrive was the first of the 2009s to get here I currently have 2000 miles driven and no problems yet | The handling is precise | Gas mileage is around 21MPG city | A little higher on the highway | It could use more storage but it is not a major issue |
