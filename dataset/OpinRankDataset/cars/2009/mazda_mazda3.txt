REVIEWS
 "words": Have owned a number of Mazdas over the yrs all good except the American built 1999 626 it was junk | Mazda 3 is recommended by me and i do lots of driving | problems | rear view mirror set too low from dealership almost wrote off car on third day due to blind spot | hesitates on a damp mornings going up hills | dealership said knew nothing about it until i gave them a list of 4 other mazda owners with same problem and they admitted they all do it | I can live with it but am careful to put in decent brand name gas that helps | seats are a bit worn after 18 months and underside of glove box all scratched otherwise its fantastic too bad they changed the body style this yr 
 "words": I got the '09 M3i 2 | 0 manual | I deliver pizza and do a lot of driving | I've driven nice cars | a porche some bmw's and a few other nice cars so I'm trying to be completely objective with my review and will break down my scoring on the scale above | Performance zippy but not real fast can't hang with the big boys but the handling is superb which brought the score up to a 7 10 | Comfort I drive for HOURS | I'm never uncomfortable | 7 10 | Fuel economy I avg 27 mpg | depending on the use of AC and if i'm driving like a maniac which i sometimes do | 350-290 miles per tank | usually around 320 | 7 10 | Fun to drive that the handling is so surprisingly responsive combined 
 "words": This is my first car and as such I am simply glad to have one but I have fallen in love with pretty much every aspect of the car | It has very good handling and a fairly peppy engine although it is not a Corvette by any means | The aesthetics are very high quality and good looking both inside and out | Mine came with a 4 speaker audio system but for a 4 speaker the sound output is very high quality with rumbling bass and clear trebles | The only gripe I have is that power windows door locks are only available in higher trim levels costing almost 3000 more | I have also had to replace the gas cap but apparently this has been redesigned and will not get stuck as my old one did | 
 "words": All of the features have been covered in other reviews but have two complaints | 1 | Someone else mentioned the dirt rocks issue | for some reason on this vehicle the rocks and dirt you pick up from the road rolls around in the wheel wells and is very audible | more so then any other vehicle I have had even a Toyota Pick UP | so that can be somewhat annoying | I purposely avoid sandy parts of the road cuz I don't want to hear the rocks rattling around for the next 10 seconds | 
 "words": I test drove just about every small car available | None drove like the Mazda 3 Grand Tourer | This vehicle is just snick snick great | The interior especially is upscale for a small car | If you are looking for value and a not just another boring econobox check this baby out | 
 "words": I owned a 95 Mazda Protege for 13 years before getting my Mazda 3 | I am really enjoying this new car | Looks nice and I receive many compliments on it | Rides wonderful and handles wonderful | sporty feel | My hubby remarked how comfortable the front passenger seat is and he's a big guy | Love the stereo system | Only thing it needs improvement on is gas mileage | Could also use a little more room in back seat | Don't know what the reliability will turn out to be but gave it a high score based on my 95 Protege | Test drove 5 cars in its class and this one by far was the best | Some felt junky cheap interiors handled lousy or too expensive | This one is best value for the money | 
 "words": Owned previous vehicleOldsmobile7 years owned this vehicle only 6 months | Purchased because we were very happy with our 2003 Mazda Protege | Interior quality lacking relative to Protege | Plastic scuffs easily and rear seat fabric fraying after only 2000 miles and 3 months | Fuel tank holds 14 | 5 gallons | Reads 3 4 full after 2 gallons used and 1 2 full after 5 gallons used | Road noise evident | Extremely small trunk relative to competition and other Mazda | As a conservative driver highway mpg is great at 35 mpg but local mpg at times in low 20's | Audio system subpar relative to other Mazda | A C does not blow very cold compared to older Mazda | Dealer service was terrible on issues | 
 "words": just got a 09 mazda3 for my wife i love the design and the dash lights are cool the only thing that i really dont like is the miles per gallon it gets it only has 1100 miles on it not sure if these have a break in period or not other than that its a great car
 "words": I recently purchased a Mazda 3 5 Door Sport after leasing a Honda Accord for the past three years | This car is GREAT | I had a couple friends recommend it and after the test drive I knew it was the car for me | It's got great styling good fuel economy and is fun to drive | The Sport version is loaded with a ton of standard features that were upgrades on other cars I looked at | The 2 | 3L engine has plenty of power both off the line as well as to get up and go on the highway | I went for the automatic for my wife but the manual shift option performs very similar to a manual transmission giving you a little more control | All-in-all I am fully satisfied and would recommend this car | 
 "words": Great car overall | Have both a 06 mazda 6 and this 09 mazda 3 | although the interior is a bit inferior of that of the 6 the 3 is very well built and has seamless lines | The 2 | 0 litre is very peppy and I imagine the 2 | 3 would only be better as my 6 has a 2 | 3 | This 3 has very tight steering and has been successful to living up to mazdas' zoom zoom motto | Excellent exterior as well much better at turning heads than a civic and corolla in my opinion | Mileage is decent although the civic may get a few more miles gallon possibly 5 or so | Overall a great car for people who like to drive | Definitely recommended | 
 "words": Test drove the Civic before deciding on the mazda 3 | It is faster more fun better build quality and does not feel like you are driving a spaceship | If you want to be bored of your car buy a corolla | Civic is still a good well built car but nowhere near as much fun as they used to be | The engine is very strong for its class and is just a great example of how good Mazda is | 
 "words": Have this car for about a month | So far wife and I are very pleased with the seat comfortinterior materials and design | I also like the quick pick up from a red light that makes it seem as if there's a much larger engine than the 2 | 0 L 148 HP standard mill | Very nimble cornering and turning | I avoided a stuck car in the middle lane of a major highway with it's quick steering response but steering is too sensitive at 60 mph and requires constant minor corrections to stay in lane | 
 "words": I found the Madda 3i touring Value Sedan had the best overall interior quality look and feel and the standard equipment package included everything I wanted | Driving it over the past few weeks confirmed that I made the right choice | The seats are very comfortable the car is nimble very maneuverable and a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": I test drove this Mazda3 and a 09 Corolla S | I was very disappointed with the Corolla | For about 900 more i got a great handling fun to drive hatchback with a 2 | 3L engine5 speed auto w manual mode4 wheel disc brakesDSC and 17 wheelscrystal pearl white paint to name a few | This car pulls strong through out the whole rev band and handles like a go cart | I am very satisfied with my purchase so far | Just wish it had a little more cargo room | Kinda tight fit for my golf clubs | 
 "words": After my previous kicked the bucket I was in the market for a new car | I test drove a couple of other vehicles but after getting in the 3 I knew it was the vehicle for me | I did quite a lot of research on every possible vehicle and was originally planned on a economy car | However the price performance and quality was exactly what I wanted | The Mazda 3 is a great car and does exactly what you would like it to | It loves to be driven it looks beautiful and stands out without being ostentatious and is a dream for someone who prefers smaller sized fun driving cars | Sure you could buy a better mpg economy car | But for the price you will NOT find a more fun to drive vehicle for the money | 
 "words": It seems to be a great little car | I purchased it because its a bargain | I won't mention what I paid for it but I will say it was more than 2000 less than the corolla and the cobalt | Interior and exterior are better looking than the aforementioned vehicles | The gas mileage could be better | 
 "words": I am a 50 year old driver and have owned several cars for 12 years so I was looking for a practical reliable car | Boring right | Well the Mazda 3i is all about practical reliable | but the cool factor is off the chart too | I compared sevaral cars in the class for the following features independent suspension abs disk brakes on all 4 wheels twin cam 4 cylinder alloys 4 doors timing chain not belt cruise curtain airbags nice sounding sound system | I got all this and lots more at a much better price than I thought possible with the 3i value package | The 3 is assembled in japan which in my experience means very high quality | This car rocks | 
 "words": I decided to write a PartIII to my reviews | PartI compares Maz3 to 2 major competitors | PartII adds more details on Maz3 | PartIII will add more comments and answer two critical questions for buyers owners | Handling is the selling point of Maz3 | But on center feel is not as good as German cars | Above 70mph you better hold onto the steeling wheel tight | The P205 50VR17 stock tires provides adequate grip | But wider tires with directional patterns will sure improve traction more | Understeer is presented in high speed | DSC is not available unless you have the touring model | Zig-zag shifter needs get used to for straight shifter users | Trunk design can be simplified to yield more usable space | 
 "words": More comments here of Mazda3 for buyers owners to note | Again this is a great car simply the best in class | Few improvements here but all are minor | Exterior styling is great | Head lights should be pointed slightly higher | On downhills the lights fall a bit short | The red tail lights are a bit dim and small | Should be brighter for safety reason | Though the bumper reflective tapes help a bit | For s model you get black plastic in real bumper | But it's more scratch resistant good when loading cargo | Real bumper does flex a bit | 
 "words": I test drove a 2009 Corolla and Honda Civic and this Mazda 3 offered more of what I wanted than either of those cars | The gauges are easy to read the buttons make sense on the dashboard | The Honda Civic has a tachometer as big as a pie plate behind the steering wheel taking up a sizable portion of the dash | Maybe that is great if you are a 16 year old boy but as a middle aged female I didn't like it and I thought it was a stupid design placement | The Mazda on the other hand is user friendly in terms of the interior and had more personality on the exterior than Corolla or Civic | I got a great GREAT | deal on my car and I may be a Mazda fan for life now | 
 "words": There is no better looking car in this class or more fun | The engine even at 2 | 0 is peppy fast and ready to go | I love how sporty it is both outside and inside | Lots of headroom for a car this size | Feels and handles like a BMW 3 series but you are paying 10-15K cheaper | Its sporty and fast enough and yet it still gets good gas mileage | Between city and highway I averaged 29- 31 gal | and the stereo which comes with the i touring sounds really good nice acoustic and full bass | I am 6'1 and I bump my head when getting into a BMW 3 series but no problem at all with the Mazda 3 | Its tight its firm and feel you are in control all the time | Its just an awesome car all around | 
 "words": My last car was a VW Golf | It served me well for 10 years | It was a fun-to-drive machine but quite costly to maintain especially with age | So I decided it's time for a new car | I test drove 3 hot hatches new Toyota Matrix 158hp 4cyl | VW Rabbit 170hp 5cyl | Mazda3 5dr 156hp 4cyl | Here's my little comparo | 3rd place Matrix | Highs big cargo room Toyota reliability | Lows Mazda3 copy cat dull handling peculiar styling high price 23k for XRS poor corner visibility due to large A pillar | 2nd place VW Rabbit | Highs big engine VW fun quality interior | Lows uncomfortable seat angled too much confusing controls strange wall under windshield questionable reliability | 
 "words": Previous to this I had a Mazda Protege5 and that was fun and I had gotten great gas mileage regardless of how I drove it | Recently I got a Mazda 3s and it is fun to drive but my protege was more fun | The biggest issue I have with it is yes we get more performance but your gas mileage suffers greatly depending on how you drive | My style of driving has been the same and yet I'm getting just barely 22 mpg around town and if I'm lucky I'll get 28 on the highway | The car is a blast to drive but the 16in rims and tires make the car feel less responsive but otherwise it's a great car | 
 "words": Honestly best looking interior car in its class Civic has nothing on this | Exterior is very stylish | 2 | 3 could do better on fuel economy but it's still much better than a 6 cylinder | This the best car for bang-for-your-buck | You get so much safety options toys and gadgets and styling all in a very reliable lil car | 
 "words": Being a honda and toyota guy for many years | I have finally step foot inside a Mazda dealership to check out the final year release of the 2009 Mazda 3 hatchback | Hey they are practically giving these away right now with 0 APR | I like the styling boy racer look thats me | I couldn't understand why I have bought and sold my previous 08 4 door civic si and 09 corolla s within 6 months time their styling was not really my cup of tea | I quickly got tired of the 6 speed manual and ridiculous righ revs on the honda and the boring ho hum corolla styling and its slow weak acceleration | Mazda did a great job with the exterior and interior styling | I added the 18mazdaspeed wheels and I am done
 "words": Just bought this vehicle for my wife 3 days ago | Prior she had a 4dr 1995 mazda protege and though she liked all the features what a step up | It matches all her wants and needs | Very sporty in look feel and handling | Nice sunroof sound system and interior | Feels like your driving a luxury car | It's also very easy to handle and park | Great value for the money especially since the 2010s are out and dealers are looking to move the 2009s | Highly recommended | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle at the very beginning of January this year so it is difficult to estimate items like reliability and build quality | I have thoroughly enjoyed everything about it so far | It's very stylish exterior is in my opinion best in class | It is fun to drive handles well and the 2 | 0L engine feels like a sizable step up from the 1 | 8L of my former Corolla | The interior is well-designed and comfortable and the dash looks sleek and the controls are easy to use contrary to what I have seen in reviews | The fuel economy is perfect for me even if not the best in its class | I get almost 30MPG off freeway | The value here is undeniable so why wait | Get one now |

 "words": If you are looking for an inexpensive car with lots of features for your money then this is the car for you | Handling is good but you have to watch it in the snow belt when the rear end would like to trade places with the front on snowy roads due to it's light weight | Acceleration is adequate with the 2 | 0 engine | There is plenty of leg room up front for 6ft | tall drivers | Trunk space for a car this size is good | Fit and finish is exceptionally good | 
 "words": Love this car | It is fun to drive has a lot of power for a small car | Good on gas but not as good as a scion or fit | Can't say enough about it | I am so glad that we decided to purchase this one over the scion or fit | I don't have any Major issues with the interior or exterior | The Bose stereo is awesome | Love the features | This is my first Mazda | I bought a manual and love the way it shifts | It is very smooth | Zoom zoom zoom for sure | 
 "words": I put 211000 miles on my 1993 Protege without a fault | Bought a 2008 Honda Fit Sport 14 months ago and it was totaled | Drove the 2009 Fit Sport Saturn Astra and Mazda3 5dr and the game was over | The Mazda is much more car than the Honda and much nicer | The Astra is nice but awkward and the lack of an aux input for the MP3 player just shows a lack of consumer focus | The Honda feels empty and lacking when compared to the Mazda | The prices are all very close so it's a good comparison in my book | I'd like the sunroof to be an option by itself | 
 "words": I am a Mazda guy | I love Mazdas | My first van was a used Mazda MPV and when I sold it I got 500 dollars with 340000 miles on it | I recently had a 95 MX-5 and absolutely loved to just drive drive drive | Then I had kids | So I went out and bought a SUV | stupid me | So I drove this SUV for 1 | 5 years and it was dull | plus it didnt help that I was getting 11 miles per gallon during hard times | So guess what I did | I comprimised and shopped around test drove | I got a Mazda 3 Hatchback | I love itlove it love it | Beautiful car fast and fun to drive | plenty of room for kids | So so happy with it | And no I don't work for Mazda |

 "words": After owning Integra for 17 | 8 years finally found something to replace it with | Nice size for one person nice luxury features | Not as fun to drive as Integra but handles just as well even better on fast curves like it's on rails | Quietness masks real acceleration compared to Integra which was throatier | A lot has changed in cars since 1991 so I'm still getting used to things like position of steering wheel further away thickness of steering column limits leg room the explosion of new technology and in my case four doors | Bose stereo is good but I do have to have the volume way up to level 40 hear details deaf in one ear so this may be me not the car | Mileage in upper 20s |
