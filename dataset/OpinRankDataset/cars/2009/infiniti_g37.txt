REVIEWS
 "words": Overall a great car | This is my second Infiniti first being the g35 | This is a big step forward | The car is beautiful both in and out | Very comfortable and fun to drive | I looked at this as well as the BMW 335i and walked away with this car mostly based on price | Being nit picky I will say that the car needs just a little more refinement in the brakes and engine department | The brakes are very touchy | not too smooth | The engine is great but you feel the shifts too much | There is also a good 2 to 2 | 5 second delay between pedal mash and power to the wheels at highway speed | 
 "words": My first time I have Inifiniti G37 Coupe it was fun to drive | a good horse power but it's for sure not a gas friendly car I have seen avg 14Mpg to max 20 Mpg and the sport model type have a noisy tires until you get used to it | Small seats it's made for big people | It has a good features | I'm enjoying it but I won't buy it again if I was asked to buy it | 
 "words": Great car overall but the clutch pedal is a bit too heavy for regular city stop and go driving | I live in Philly and all Infiniti dealers are located in the suburbs | The suburban test drive and the back roads that showed off the handling really didn't reveal how tiring the clutch pedal would become in the city environment where I reside | I have a 2006 Honda Element with manual trans that is a pleasure to drive in the city with its light clutch and precise shift action | It's very very similar to the BMW 3 Series that I recently test drove | If I could have driven the Infiniti in the city for a day or two I probably would not have purchased it despite its other wonderful virtues | 
 "words": Just got my G37 w Premium Nav packages and love it | Fun to drive looks great fit and finish are outstanding | Couldn't ask for a better value | I am looking forward to many years of driving fun with this great car | 
 "words": Just got this car yesterday for 4k under invoice price what a steal | It's a nice car and well balanced with sport and luxury | Dream car and only 20 dollars more for insurance from accord coupe to G37 | Buy it and you won't regret | I love it and I would just sit in there for like hours and smile like stupid | 
 "words": Great car | Excellent acceleration braking and handling | Sound system is awesome and looks are incredible | 
 "words": Just had a 07 G35 and upgraded to the 09 G37 couldn't be happier | The 09 has a bit more acceleration better hwy MPG and the deals they're offering it's the best bang for the buck in performance sedans right now | The 7 spd Auto in the 09 compared to the 5 spd in the 07-08 really helps w fuel economy | I've already noticed a 2mpg increase on the hwy and the motor isn't really broken in yet | The 7 spd tends to hunt a bit more for gears in speeds under 30 mph but I know there's a Tech service bulletin to have a trans reflash to smooth the shifts so that'll be taken care of | 
 "words": Turned in my FX45 on this new G37xS | It is stunning | The driving experience is pretty incredible | The comfort is quite good the features are very complete the size and packaging are good and the electronics are excellent | As you would expect the performance envelope is outstanding | Excellent power throughout the rev range | Brakes are strong and easy to modulate | Handling is responsive and sporting without being at all punishing | After 2 months and about 4000 miles I love this car | My G is fully optioned and very comfortable | Not a single item on the punchlist for the dealer | Everything works as it should and fits properly | My MPG to date is about 19 but my foot is heavy | 
 "words": I am the proud owner of this 2009 G37 and so far I love it | I try to find excuses to go somewhere just so I can drive it | This car is FAST | I have to be careful so I don't get a ticket | I usually keep it in D mode to tame the horses and for better fuel economy | I average about 22mpg in city driving | The navigation and premium packages were well worth the upgrade | This car is just a dream to drive | 
 "words": Moonlight White G37S with Premium Navigation Sport Technology 4- wheel Active Steering packages Just brought this home | I had been shopping around since February | Looked at the BMW 335 Audi A4 Mercedes C300 Lexus IS350 ES350 Volkswagen Passat and CC | After all was said and done the bang for the buck was clearly with the 09 G37 | The most impressive part of the car's performance isn't necessarily the 0-60 time although it is nice | I find that its ability to get up and go when already at highway speeds to get around slower traffic and put safe distance between you and others has to be experienced to be fully appreciated | 
 "words": This is my first Infiniti loyal Lexus owner and I am happy with my choice | I feel this is the best hard-top convertible for the money | It looks great with the top up or down | Considered and drove a BMW 335 Convertible and a Lexus IS 350 Convertible | Did not like the looks of the Lexus and the BMW was 8000 more WITHOUT a Nav system and other features on the Infiniti | PLUS the dealership was FRIENDLY and took GREAT care of me | Overall I would highly recommend this to someone looking for the perfect blend of luxury sportiness and value | 
 "words": Looking and researching the G's from the previous body style I took a dive for this one and believe me it's 180 degree turn from their previous model | Like said before gotta get the packages | I have the 4wheel active steer pkg takes corners at whatever speed without body role | good investment premium navigation tech pkg intelligent cruise control | The shifting and acceleration is as sporty and amazing as driving a little 2dr lotus | Braking is as smooth and effective as a 100K automobile | and the best part it's a quiet sleek quality car | without shouting for attention like the MB BMW etc | 
 "words": I bought a BMW 328XI coupe a few months ago in error and now made the change to the G37X | Though the mistake cost me it was well worth it | The difference between the two cars and the value you get with the G37 made the change something that I had to do | Though the 328XI is a fine car it does not have the road manners of the G37X | I have always wanted the G37X and I waited for the AWD to become available in the coupe | This car is a monster on the road the ride is perfectly smooth the quality of the ride is perfect and the performance is impeccable | Infiniti is number one with me | 
 "words": I have had my convertible for over a month | I have been waiting for it since Feb | I LOVE everything about it except the cuphold situation or more accurately the lack of good cupholders | I ordered the manual version and test drove the automatic | Different cupholders | Also my average gas mileage is about 17 | 1 mpg | I would love to get the advertised 19-21mpg | I'm still learning all the features to the car but I am totally enjoying the navigation system and phone iPod connection | Also the speakers in the headrest is the best | I will say that the Lexus has more trunk space with the top down than the Infiniti | I only have room for an umbrella and a baseball hat in the trunk | 
 "words": The handling and performance is superb acceleration is great under any circumstance | The technology loaded in this vehicle really makes the difference with comparable 335 or A5 a fully loaded G37 coupe would cost around 8-10K less than any other European brand | 
 "words": The more I drive my G37S Sedan the more I love it | In my opinion it blows the Mercedes C-Class away destroys the Audi A4 and is 10000 less than the BMW 335i comparably equipped | That said it is a great combination of utility and performance | The G37 is fast in a straight line and also a great handling car | Impressively it feels much lighter than it actually is | While the G37 is very capable of good gas mileage it is incredibly difficult to fight the temptation to hammer the throttle | Hence gas mileage can be an issue if you have a lead foot | In short bravo Infiniti | You have created a great mix of performance and luxury for a reasonable cost | 
 "words": I was in the market for a sport sedan for 6 month | I compared the A4 IS350335XI | For my preference none of these cars compared to the G overall package | Is rough edgy but with class great all wheel drive system | I love it | 
 "words": Doesn't get any better than this | Coming from a Ford Explorer to an Infiniti is like eating spam for 4 years and then moving up to caviar | I checked out the Mercedes C Class the Acura TL Lexus IS and BMW 3 Series and none of them comparable to what my Infiniti is | The handling is great it's F-A-S-T for a sedan and has everything I need | Other people complained that the doors not locking automatically but mine do so maybe it's just the Journey model that does so | If I could change anything I would have gotten the model with all the bells and whistles Nav Bluetooth etc | but again I was coming from an Explorer lol | 
 "words": Having driven a 2006 G35 coupe for the past 3 years I thought the new G37 coupe was an obvious choice when looking for a new car | I would get the driving experience I LOVED from the old car and more gadgets and features than an electronics show in Vegas | I was sorely mistaken | The transmission in this car searches for gears like Indiana looking for the Holy Grail | The steering is so loose that any imperfection in the pavement sends it all over the road | Driving it is a maddening endeavor | I feel like I am always trying not to break it or push it over the edge | I have called the dealer and while they assure me this is normal operation I have an appointment for Friday | 
 "words": Like other posters I researched test drove so many vehicles before finally taking the plunge on the G | None could compare to Infiniti's styling comfort power technology and VALUE | I had to have the premium package and navi | The navigation system in this car is awesome -one of the best on the market | The toys on the inside bluetooth ipod connector back up camera really appeal to my techie side | The jump from 0-60 will make your heart flutter | The interior leather is supple and the car is simply striking on the road | Be prepared -people will stare | I just cannot say enough about this car | Infiniti -keep doing what you're doing | Customer for life | 
 "words": I've had this car for 3 months 2000 miles | Overall great car | Comfortable good performance great fit and finish | Getting 20-21 mpg mostly city driving | Nitpicks | While the seating is comfortable the head room is tight | Unless I sit near the bottom of seat height adjustment my heads hits the roof I'm 5' 11 | Bose radio is good not great | Transmission lower gears are not well matched winds up to quickly going jerky when slowing down | 
 "words": I was shopping around for a new car and did extensive research on sedans in the same class | Lexus IS Audi A4 Acura TL Benz C Class etc | After test driving the Infiniti I was sold | This car has got the most powerful standard engine in its class and it makes it such an amazing machine to drive | 0-60 in a little over 5 seconds | Gotta love it | At the same time the brakes make stopping feel effortless so that you're confident driving such a strong car | Lastly the interior is beautiful and classy | I have no regrets in buying this car and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent four-door sports car | 
 "words": The iPod does indeed recharge while driving the car | Or else I've been able to drive over 8000 miles on a single charge since last February | And yes this is one fabulous car | My mpg has been over 23 for summer driving part highway and part local | 
 "words": Overall an excellent choice | This car is FAST | And it has all the features you would ever want | I got the Premium and Navi which are a must have for a lux car | Way better than BMW 3 series and more stylish than the TL | Old G series was boring but I love the new design 7 speed AT and 328 HP | Interior is great and comfortable BMW interior is boring leatherette for a lux car | Are you kidding me | TL is bigger but not as fast and not as pretty on the outside | I thought about getting a Maxima but heck it's almost the same price so why not get the G37 | With the confidence of Inifinti reliability I am one happy camper | 
 "words": I just got this car a few weeks ago but I just can't get enough of it | It's really fun to drive | I have nothing against the BMW's but I personally felt that this Infiniti responded better than the 3 series | I honestly have no complaints at all | I heard someone say that the display was hard to see but I don't get that at all | I think the cabin is well designed | 
 "words": Love this car | I owned the first G35 coupe back in 2003 and traded it in 2006 for Lexus IS and missed the G every day until I bought my 2009 G37 Journey coupe the other day | Feels great to drive a real high performance car again | 
 "words": I test drove every AWD in this class | btw could not believe the Lexus 250 the interior looked and felt cheap and drive wasn't great | I just kept coming back to this G | Love it | Before this I was in an Oldsmobile Alero | gasp | Finally I have a car that can handle my driving | I'm in heaven | 
 "words": Coming from a '06 G35 6MT sedan w sport and premium I thought I would miss the VLSD and 6MT | The 7AT and VQ37VHR more than make up for it | This engine is more powerful and more refined | The power band is excellent and power is always ready | I love being in 7th gear and doing 2600 rpm at 80mph averaging over 29MPG | The cabin is quieter over the G35 and feels roomier | My sun shade from the G35 fits on the G37 BONUS | I was looking at the ISF C63 G8 GXP and 330 | I wanted a sporty sedan that wasn't too big | The e55 would have been too big | The G37 gave me everything I wanted at a wonderful price | 
 "words": I did an extensive research for a while | I was comparing a couple of cars BMW 328i Infiniti G37 and MB C350 | Eventually I went for G37 | After driving 1500 miles I'm glad I made a right decision | This is an incredible driving machine with tons of power under hood | The curb turning is really great and better than 328i | I feel so thrilled whenever I do 0-60mile acceleration | This is the best entry luxury sports sedan by far | 
 "words": I cross-shopped the 328i xDrive TL-SHAWD A4 2 | 0 and IS-250AWD | None of them came close to offering the same blend of performance handling features technology and usability as the G37xS | The engine is extremely powerful pulling away with four passengers up a hill is still easy to elicit a Whoa from everyone on board the chassis handling BMW-like read near-perfect the technologies voice control music box swiveling headlights laser cruise traffic gps etc | etc | both cool and easy-to-use the seats bolster you in like some high-luxe sport cars and the overall experience is extremely satisfying and fun | 
 "words": I have the 09 G37S coupe with the premium and sport package | What a car | I really cannot find anything to criticize | I also have a 08 911TT Cab so I know cars and power etc | The fit and finish is excellent and the interior is great | Some people criticize the 7speed auto but honestly I don't know why and the same goes for the interior | One feature that is cool is the music box with the 9 GB harddisk | At first I thought it was worthless but once you have loaded in all your CDs no more carrying around CDs | If you have to have more status want to pay thousands more and get less then by all means buy a Lexus or BMW | The dealer treats you like a king no begging for loaner | 
 "words": This is my second Infiniti | My last vehicle was a Cayenne however I wanted to shed myself of an SUV while maintaining the versatility of AWD | I decided on the g37x coupe based on the reliability and performance factor of my previously owned Infiniti FX 35 | My FX never and I mean never went back to the dealership | I had the oil changed every 3000 miles at my local service station | I test drove the BMW 335x and could not justify spending the difference in price for a comparable car | The g37 coupe is comfortable handles well and has insane acceleration | The standard feature list far surpasses any of its competitors from Germany | I would definitely buy it again | 
 "words": Great all-around luxury sports sedan | Plenty of power is there throughout the powerband | Transmission responds when you want it to yet is smooth in nearly all driving conditions | All- wheel drive is great in rainy conditions and light snow | Getting around 23-27 mpg in city and highway mix with normal driving habits depending on the mix of city verses highway miles and how hard I drive the car | Recently got 31 | 2 mpg with cruise set at 58 mpg on eastern shore of MD | Handling is great without S trim no need to upgrade unless you really want a bit more performance for the extra | Nice standard technology and luxury with more toys and comfort features available if you want them | 
 "words": There is no comparison to a BMW 3 series this is the car to beat | Plain and simple if you love driving aggressively I might add and love to see cars in your rear view mirror then get this car | The G37 X is all u need | Fun to drive | Power is incredible | The interior is classy not overbearing | The ride is smooth | This car will put a huge smile on your face when you drive and look at it | Enough said | Keep blowing away BMW | True drivers will appreciate and love this car | 
 "words": Spent 17 months meticulously reading reviews and test driving every car in the entry level luxury class plus many other categories before selecting the G37X coupe | Although I bought the car this May I test drove it during a Michigan snow storm and have a strong impression of its road grip-handling during both good and very poor road conditions | This car is superb by all measures | It's exterior lines are eye catching and interior refinements are topnotch | Fuel economy is better than I had anticipated as I'm averaging 21 MPG of mostly city driving | Not too shabby | This car is awesome | 
 "words": I was looking to buy the new Lexus IS250c and then test drove the Infiniti G37 convertible and was sold on it | I bought the car the next day | I love my first Infiniti and first convertible | It has enough power to get me in trouble and is sexy on the inside and out | The interior is beautiful and I love the heated cooled seats | 
 "words": A perfect mix of fun luxury and practicality | BMW 5 features size and performance for a tad over 40K | Most car for the money on the road | 
 "words": I just turned in a 2006 FX | I loved that car because it had versatility and handled like a sports sedan | When I went back to the Infiniti dealership to check out an '09 FX the new version just didn't whet my appetite | Too exotic maybe | I test drove a G37X and wow | Now that's a sports sedan | I gave up some storage and SUV driving height but came away with a rocket ship on wheels that is as tight as a drum | I had test driven a BMW 328X also and this car is as tight as that but with ample more power | The 328 is not even in the same class power wise | 
 "words": Just got my new G37 convertible and I LOVE it | Thought about the new Lexus convertible but didn't like the way it looked | The Infiniti is completely awesome | Great power and all the bells and whistles | The Infiniti dealership treated me like I was some kind of superstar | I'll never buy another car anywhere else | I'm impressed with the car the service and the dealership | What more could you ask for | I'll have this car for a long time | 
 "words": My first Infiniti and I have no desire to buy another car ever | No complaints Fun to drive | Comfortable | Roomy | FAST | Beautiful | LOVE the safety features technology pkg | where has this back-up cam been all my life | Also the Infiniti dealership was the best car-buying experience I've ever had | 
 "words": I admit I am very picky when it comes to spending my money | All I am wondering is How can they make G37 so perfect | Handling precise | Power Like you got a nuclear slab under your hood Like Iron Man P Interiors Better than competitors Lexus had better | Looks I love it | Size Bigger than competitors | G all the way | 
 "words": I was looking for a fun car in addition to my FX35 | I test drove Audi TT BMW 335ix and the 370Z | The G37x gives me best value and comfort and I can always count on the Infiniti quality | I based my final decision on a combination of these factors performance comfort toys fun to drive value and reliability | 
 "words": I initially wanted a CTS | The G37x for me was the best value has excellent expected reliability 3rd year in production also tends to work out some early-production bugs and leaves the other cars in the dust when it comes to acceleration | My numerical ratings may have been overly harsh but when you look at its competitors not considering price the G37x is a bit rough around the edges | 
 "words": This is my first entry level luxury car and I must admit I am glad I chose this rocket ship | The G37 is gorgeous has ridiculous power handles awesome and is a stunner to look at | I forgot to mention I saved at least 100 in lease price compared to 4 cylinder audi and also way more than 100 for a 335 bmw | The interior is amazing the drive is comfortable and the power is insane | The AWD is incredible you can do 70 mph off the highway without hearing a thing | It's just an incredible machine | G37 4ever | 
 "words": I've had this car for just over a month and we my wife and I love it | I had a hard time choosing between the 3 series and the G37 but my wife made the decision easy because she preferred the G37 interior | The navigation and premium package was a must and because we hadn't bought a new car recently the blue tooth and backup camera were nice features | What got us to the dealership though was predicted RELIABILITY and we chose Infiniti based on my wife's positive experience with Nissan | 
 "words": Great car this is my 4th Nissan Infiniti car | They just keep getting better | My favorite aspect of the Nissin Infiniti family is the fact that they set a benchmark against an overpriced competitor | Then make the Better Cheaper car faster | For the most Bang for your buck you cannot go wrong with Nissan Infiniti line of cars | 
 "words": This is the second Nissan product I have owned the first being a '93 300ZX | The Infiniti is an incredible vehicle from nearly every aspect | It's tough to beat what you get for the price with this car | My previous car a BMW 335i was constantly in and out of the shop | 
 "words": I moved to Minnesota from AZ a while ago and wanted to purchase a AWD vehicle | After an exhaustive search I chose the G37x and could not be happier | I thought I would miss my BMW 3 series but I am surprised to say I don't | It is a different drive but as a daily commuter way outclasses my old car | 
 "words": I test drove TL S-AWD BMW 335 X drive and G37 X | BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration handling brakes and comfort | G37 was good too but not as good as BMW | I bought the G37 because I got 6 grand off MSRP and it's roomier inside | I'm sure it's a lot more reliable than BMW | 
 "words": I absolutely love this vehicle | It is so much fun to drive and for the money is the most powerful coupe you can find at that price | 
 "words": I shopped for some time comparing cars-planned on a BMW but the 9000 diff was too much to contend with | The character of the car is amazing | It's a rocket when you want it or a quiet cruiser | Went to the dealer for a coupe came out with a sedan with no regrets | The engine is the MOST responsive I have owned- quick revving | The transmission is great | I have noticed that it does well in just about every situation except for quick stops can't shift down fast enough I guess | Otherwise it has aggressive shifting pattern that I prefer smooth and determined | Personally I think the car is under rated always compared to BMW when and reliability really make it the better choice | Biased reviews | 
 "words": The car has a real nice ride to it and so far I'm very happy with my purchase | I haven't had it that long to really comment on the mpg but so far it's about as advertised | I only have 2 complaints about the car 1 when you take your foot off the gas and the car begins to slow down it has a rough downshift from 3rd to 2nd | Not something you'd expect from an auto | 2 the brake pads give off way too much brake dust | 
 "words": Favorite Features
 "words": Comfortable driver's seat plenty of room in front great features | Rear seats are a bit tight but the rear headroom is fine | Handles steers stops and accelerates extremely well and is very fun to drive | The controls for bluetooth nav climate and audio features are intuitive and easy to use | The backup camera is fantastic | Gas mileage is not great but it's a heavy car with 328 hp so that's to be expected | Very solid construction and well executed interior | 
 "words": Have had this car about a month with 1800 miles on it and I love it | It's the best of both worlds you can just cruise or drive it hard and it responds flawlessly no matter what | The 7AT helps with the gas mileage and is fun to drive in the manual mode | Coming from a Maxima I expect the same reliability as well | 
 "words": This is my first all-wheel drive car | In the past I was a rear-drive enthusiast I've owned 3 BMW's and most recently a 2003 Infiniti G35S | The ride is top quality and the car is one of the best I have driven | I was initially concerned that the weight of the AWD would hurt the handling and acceleration | The impact is really minimal vs | the S version but I live in the snow belt | Even on an icy road it's very hard to spin the wheels great traction | I was also concerned that the sport seats would be a bit tight but after driving for a few days I was convinced that they are an excellent choice unless you are over 210 lbs | Overall I am very pleased | 
 "words": Have it for the last 2 weeks | interior design comfort and features are outstanding | I switched from a BMW 3 series and will take some time to adjust to the drive | but I think G37 comes close | 
 "words": I was looking for a pre-owned Lexus GS350 or M35x Infiniti but ran into trouble finding low mileage examples and the new ones were too expensive | I actually thought the Ininiti G and the Lexus IS were too small | One day while waiting to test drive a pre-owned M the sales rep suggested I test drive a new G | I did and it was love at first drive | It is one of the most solid cars I have ever driven has plenty of power and all of the controls for the Nav sound system phone etc are extremely easy to use | Once you get to use the controls a short time you can figure out how to use all of the functions without referring to an instruction booklet | This car is more than a 3 series and much cheaper | 
 "words": Test drove an Audi A4 Acura TL BMW 328 and Lexus ES 350 | I found the G37x the best combination of performance comfort and value | This car is fun to drive | I've owned it for a couple of months now and I still look forward to driving it | I couldn't decide if I should upgrade to the high tech package but I am very happy I did | The high tech package adds to the overall enjoyment of driving this car | After reading about how poor the fuel efficiency is I was not expecting much | While it's certainly not great its not that bad | Unless your expectations are for something that would cost tens of thousands more you will not be disappointed with this car | 
 "words": I just turned in my leased 2006 M35 and picked up a new 2009 G37xS Sedan | I am very pleased | This car is much sportier has 48 more horses than the M and is a blast to drive | The steering is much tighter and with the all-wheel drive it sticks to the road in dry rainy or snowy weather | The sport model comes with the paddle shifters and 18 alloy wheels | Very nice look in the new Moonlight White color | 
 "words": This car surprised me | I stopped in to test the G and the M35 as well but was shocked by the superior handling of the G | I drove the 328 A4 and CTS but this was superior especially considering it's the stock setup | Only 500 miles so I haven't tested everything in the NAV pkg yet | Quality construction handling steering quietness styling and power come for a competition-beating price and make this car a winner | Fuel mileage looks grim but we'll see after more tanks | 
 "words": Overall I am extremely satisfied with my 2009 Journey sedan | This thing is fast and handles really well | The dials and controls are mostly intuitive | I like that you don't have to use the scroll wheel to control the stereo and climate controls | The voice commands for the Bluetooth integration work pretty well but some of the prompts are a little long to get through | 
 "words": I have owned many vehicles including the KING of performance the ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE and yes the Bimmers are a blast to drive they just lack all of the other stuff you would expect when you are purchasing a luxury vehicle | Simply the Infiniti G37 gives you the performance of the Bimmer but for a whole lot less and ten times more technology and features you cannot even get on the BMW | I know I know people always say if you can afford a BMW then money really is not an issue but in this day and age 10k is still 10k | Unless you must have those three letters in your driveway get the Infiniti G37xS and if you want to blow 10k buy some GM stock | 
 "words": I wanted something fast two doors manual transmission and AWD and arrived at the Infiniti after eliminating all the competition | Felt like I got 80 of what I wanted and getting that other 20 would have cost more than double | Even though the Infiniti was the least expensive thing on my list I'm happy with it and have no regrets | 
 "words": I had been looking for cars for quite a while and was really looking forward to the new A4 after test driving almost everything | This new G37 may not look like it but it is a great evolution of the G35 Last spring I rented a G35 while on vacation but felt that my B5 S4 was superior after the rental | The gas pedal was very touchy and the transmission had a mind of it's own | This G37xS feels so solid that it's hard to believe it's based on the same car that I drove 8 months ago | Anyone considering a BMW should take a G37 for a test drive and try to deny the primal thrill that this V6 delivers at redline | You should buy this car because it sounds so much better than it's competition | 
 "words": I looked for quite a while before I ordered my G37xS | I was a big 3 letter fan BMW but after I drove the 2008 G35 I was sold | I began to read about the improvements that were coming for 2009 and ordered one as early as I could | The AWD Sport is fantastic | I love the paddle shifters | The car handles very well and it accelerates so smoothly that you barely feel the shifts | The fit and finish are great | I am a big guy and I fit quite comfortably | Everyone talks about the value and I agree this car is better than every car priced below 65K | The more other cars I drove the more it made my decision clearer | I have 3000 miles on it and loved driving every one of them | Fantastic vehicle | 
 "words": I was in the market for an entry level luxury sport sedan for 6 months | All I kept hearing was how great the BMW 3 series was | So I test drove it | While a great performer the interior felt boring and the run flat tires were very loud | So I waited a few more months for the G37 to come out | I'm very glad I waited | Infiniti was always trying to catch up to the 3 series in terms of performance and styling and it seems that they finally caught up | To me it out performs the BMW with a much more luxurious interior | Plus it's got more ponies 330 vs 300 | Let's not even mention the 10k I saved by going with the G | This is the car for the driving enthusiast that wants the performance and luxury
 "words": I just purchased this 2009 G37x coupe for my wife | She previously owned a 2008 G35x sedan but had always wanted the coupe but they did not make it in an all wheel drive version | This car is quick sporty luxurious handles like a dream and has all the toys you could want | It definitely stands out in a crowd with its looks and keeps you pampered on the inside | We ordered it fully loaded with the tech pkg nav pkg prem pkg spoiler wood trim factory impact sensor alarm and the illuminated kick plates | I am 6'2 and have no problem driving or riding in this coupe |
