 "words": I bought this car because of it's looks | But was disappointed by the performance | The brakes are super sensitive and it jerks when braking and my back hurts every time | Poor visibility for a short person | Very bad on ice and slick roads | In real life look can be deceiving | 
 "words": I have owned my 2009 Altima for 7 months now | I love to drive it | It is such a fun good looking car | It drives and handles well but it does have some exterior engine noise that could be looked into | Interior room needs a little expanding | They could have taken some of that trunk and given more leg room for backseat passengers | 
 "words": When accelerating the car hesitates significantly | This happens primarily in going from slower to faster speeds and around 2000rpm | Then when you give it a touch more gas it takes off | It borders on being dangerous | I'm currently trying to get Nissan to recognize that there is an issue | I feel like I'm getting the run around | 
 "words": I love my new Nissan | I purchased the Nissan Altima 3 | 5Se with the premium package | The car is super fast | The pickup is amazing | The seats are comfortable | The backseat is huge | Enough room for 3 adult size kids | The car is quiet | The controls are easy to handle | The gas mileage could be better | The car still rides like a dream and worth the extra in premium gas |

 "words": Bought this car in June 09 been back to the dealer 3 times for a service engine light code | They say that the code is the evap sys | but cannot find any leaks | Had an 04 Nissan sedan prior to this and never had a problem | The 09 Nissan Coupe is very stylish on the outside but the interior is cheesy and the stereo speakers already buzz and the road noise is terrible | Very disappointed with the overall build quality | As usual you pay more and get less | This is my wife's car and she says it is fun to drive | I drive an 04 Chevy colorado pu and it is quieter than the Nissan | Do yourself a favor buy American | 
 "words": Car is great | Looks really good | Like it in Silver the best | Handles pretty well | Lots of packages | conv conv plus and connection package | Looking forward to better reliability than I had with my Olds Alero v6 | That was a fun car to drive but too many issues with the head gasket leaking | Now I have a 4cylinder but I am liking it | Coupe should have lights design that sedan has | Love radio but does need quicker way to get from low 'd station to higher without having to hold down seek and wait | Also brakes are a bit touchy | Steering seems to not want to center for some reason | Wind noise is really loud with windows down on faster drive | super loud | Key fab buttons look alike
 "words": This coupe is a fine-looking car | I got the Slate color which is a really nice and elegant color looks much better than white | Classy car that looks sporty without hanging a silly spoiler on the trunk | Have gotten lots of compliments on its looks | Have not seen another of these coupes on the road although have seen the Infiniti G37 couple which looks just about the same but costs about twice as much | This car is a very good value for the money | Car handles well giving a sporty drive while keeping good road feel | Comfortable to drive | I am well satisfied with my first Nissan | 
 "words": I have owned a new 2009 Nissan Altima for a little less than 5 months | And I find the push-button ignition very unreliable | On three different occasions now I just could not start the car | I took it into the dealer | I was told that they changed the codes | It doesn't happen often but when it does it is most aggravating | Tonight I waited in the dark for the Auto Club after trying more than a half hour to start it | Finally the push button ignition connected and I called the Auto Club to cancel service | I know that you have to push on the brake pedal to get it started and I have done this repeatedly without success | Is there a sure-fire way to start this car | Please tell me | 
 "words": I looked at the Accord and the Camry to measure up against the Altima | I believe all three of those cars are comparable | The main selling point to go with the Altima was the look of the car | I have received many compliments on the car that I do not believe I would receive had I bought either of the other two cars | Aside from the looks this car has been fantastic | The fuel economy has been amazing do not believe any review that tells you otherwise | The handling and the comfort of the Altima has met and exceeded our expectations | Nissan has done a fantastic job with this car and we couldn't be happier with a purchase | Kudos Nissan great job | You have earned a long time customer | 
 "words": This is a fun car to drive | Traded in a 2009 accord EX-L for an end of year 09 Altima 2 | 5 SL | The Altima is a great car | has excellent pickup with the CVT | Smooth and quiet | Fuel economy is good just took a 4 hour road trip saw a little over 30 mpg | 
 "words": Brought home a second Altima 2009 2 | 5 in less than a year to join the 2008 3 | 5 sibling at home | We love these cars | Great handling good acceleration and power even in the I4 | Got our 3 | 5 after testing 4 and the 2 | 5 after testing 6 each time visiting 3 dealers | Learned something very valuable out-of-round tires cause bad vibrations shimmy | Result of sitting in one spot on the lot too long a year or so | Permanently damages the steel belt radials you need new tires | Also discovered that cars made in Canton rather than Smyrna seem to be better quieter engines and superior quality parts such as knobs trim | Must be the QA program Canton established after a bad start | 
 "words": I love the styling and comfort of my 2 | 5S and am glad I made the choice to buy a Nissan product this time around | It has a lot of zip and a sporty look for a 4 door sedan | I've always owned 2 door coupes but this 4 door car has won me over | 
 "words": I bought this car in June 09 but it was an 08 left over from the previous year | I paid 21500 including ttl | They gave me and awesome deal and I loved the service | It has great pick up and no can pass me up | Has good traction and excellent features | It could more cushy seats but they are ok | The only thing worng is that the right wiper doesnt work right | So I am going to take it to get the wiper replaced | But as far as a v6 it is an awesome car | Better than Toyota and Honda | Another thing I noticed that was fishy was that the gap between the passenger door and the back passenger side door has a larger gap between them than the opposite side | Same with gaps on the hood sides
 "words": Car has smooth ride and decent handling | Handling could be improved with better OE tires | Very pleased with MPG so far | Lease deal was terrific and that is what swayed me although I do like the styling and interior design | Intelligent key is great no fishing for the remote | 
 "words": Just purchased this vehicle a week ago using the clunker incentive | I purchased the Altima 2 | 5S with all the options except for the Navi | So far I have driven it 900 miles | Ride handling acceleration etc are all excellent | I couldn't be happier | 
 "words": Had the car for two months and water has entered on the drivers side | Although the dealer is attempting to determine the cause and will fix under the warranty I now worry whether there has been any damage to the wiring or computer systems most critical to this vehicle as the water has entered up under the dash | Particularly the keyless starting system and the possible rust to the floor boards due to the amount of water that has been deposited since I do not know how much water has entered the car | I am retired and have not driven much and there have been at least 4 heavy rains | 
 "words": I traded in my 4Runner thinking that I would get better fuel efficiency based on the advertised 23 31 mpg | It's giving a dismal 18 mpg in the city and a pathetic 20 | 5 mpg combined | And yes it is the 4 cylinder 2 | 5S | My 4Runner was giving me just a mile or two less with a 6 cylinder engine | Besides the poor fuel efficiency it's a decent car but if you are looking for better mileage look elsewhere | My last Nissan purchase | 
 "words": I got the 2 | 5SL with the nav package | I'm very happy with the car | I love the CVT very responsive and smoother than the 07 loaner the dealer gave me while waiting for my car | Car is fun to drive and has a surprising amount of power for a 4 cyl made me forget about not being able to get the V6 | I average about 27-29 mpg in suburban traffic | It stinks that stability and traction control are only available in the V6 cyl | My other big gripe is the radio that comes with the nav package | Could be MUCH better | Sounds good though Overall this is the best car I've bought to date | I enjoy driving it and it has a smooth and quiet ride | Engine can be a little noisy when revved though | 
 "words": I got the SL package on my 2 | 5S and am only mildly content with the performance vs | options compromise I chose | Having only owned previous 8 cyl | cars Last was a Continental the change to 4cyl has been an adjustment to say the least | Ride is great styling and value are better than Accd Camry Mazda6 | Power is acceptable | but wish I got the 6cyl | Still think the mileage for either is great | 
 "words": This is my first foreign vehicle | I have been a Ford Guy since I started to drive 32 years ago | I tried Honda Toyota and Nissan is my choice | This car is fun to drive and the gas mileage is unreal | I get on average 31 mpg | I am 6'3 and I have plenty of head and leg room | There is also plenty of room for 3 average adults in the back seat also | No need for the 6 cyl for power just take the 4 cyl first and give it a try | Much better gas mileage also | 
 "words": I test drove this car the Toyota Corolla S and the Honda Accord Coupe | I liked the Altima the best because it was a bit smaller than the Accord and felt a bit more sporty | Simplicity also comes to mind | The doors felt sturdy and the rear of the car is very attractive | I think the headlights need a bit more work though needs to be more like the 370z | I wish there were LED tail lights as well | It would also be nice if there was a remote trunk release | My 1999 Nissan Maxima has folding side mirrors so why is this feature NOT included on a 2009 4-cylinder model it is standard on the V6 model | Overall very nice car but has the potential to squash the competition with some adjustments | 
 "words": First car I have ever bought on my own | I was looking at the Honda accord coupe gti and and civic si being that I am 26 I didn't want a boy racer so it came down to the altima and accord | The accord is a little bigger but the altima drives like it weighs nothing and the look of the altima surpasses the accord hands down | Love the cockpit of a drivers seat love this car
 "words": I love this car | I was undecided between the Altima and the Malibu and after test driving both of these cars I fell in love with the Altima | It has so much more room and it drives so much smoother then the Malibu | I'm so pleased with my final decision | Also you can also use the Altima as a standard or an automatic vehicle | I don't know how to drive a standard but my boyfriend loves that we have that extra feature in the car | The push start button is amazing because when I leave work my hands are always so full so I've always had to dig for my keys and now I don't have to | This is a really amazing car and I'm so pleased that I chose the NISSAN ALTIMA | 
 "words": This car is amazing | PLENTY of power considering it is a 4 cyl | when I test drove it I thought it was a 6 | Inside is comfortable with lots of room for my 6 ft husband to drive and sit | Back seat is giant | I will buy another when I am ready and usually that is a year but I want to keep this one for years to come | My friend is going to buy one this weekend | 
 "words": I was in the market for a new car and after reading reviews and test driving a lot of cars the Nissan Altima was my eventual choice | First the good great power for a 4-cyl and great gas mileage | Interior is plain but functional | Very stylish | But now the bad | After 1 week of driving A LOT of vibrations in the floor and pedals from the road | It is to the point now that my feet physically hurt if I operate the car for more than 20 minutes | According to 2 different Nissan mechanics this is perfectly normal and why the car is so cheap | I don't consider 24K to be cheap and I certainly don't expect any car to operate like this one | This purchase is a regrettable one for sure | 
 "words": I'm what you could consider a hesitant buyer someone who may spend a year researching and test driving vehicles before committing to buy | As a long- time Honda owner I still own an Odyssey the Accord was my initial favorite but I've researched and test drove most of the competition as well | These are all excellent cars | While I cannot claim that the Altima is the better car it had enough features I liked to win me over | I owned it for almost 3 months now and I am still excited every morning when I get into it | Since the Accord was my initial choice I'm listing below the features of the Altima that won me over | What I liked in the competition is listed as suggested improvements | 
 "words": Driven 2600 miles so far | Car is very fun to drive I have the 6M | Is getting 31-32mpg I drive 70 30 hwy cty | Love the styling front seats are comfortable | Not sure about the passenger comfort no one has complained | Car is very steady at 75MPH | Great family car that I don't mind driving around by myself | Stereo is ok nothing special | Great value for the money | 
 "words": We shopped this primarily against the Honda Accord Coupe and are very glad that we went with the Altima | After about 30 days of ownership car is exceeding our expectations | Price paid is also a big plus since we were able to negotiate a total of almost 5k off the sticker price of 28 | 2k | 
 "words": The Altima's suspension is superior to the 3-series | It handle Manhattan and Jersey pot holes as if they don't exist | The steering is tight and responsive | Got a sick deal too | Fully-loaded without nav for 1500 below invoice and got them to throw in fog lights | 
 "words": I have always owned American made vehicles until this purchase | I now ask myself what took me so long | Drives like a dream great fuel economy and pretty to look at | Very classy and comfortable car | I will never buy anything else I am sold for life | If you haven't decided what to buy look no further | 
 "words": I've test driven almost any mid-size family sedan on the market and that's what I can say about Nissan Altima | Compared with others in its class Nissan is noisy | Its engines both 2 | 5 and 3 | 5L produce on average 10-15HP more than the competition but at what cost | Engine noise beyond 2000RPM is excessive | At par with Suzuki I've driven the other day yes it's that bad | On the positive side the exterior and interior design is fantastic | No nonsense or extra not needed buttons | Everything is ergonomically laid out and easy to use | CVT is the biggest and unique feature about this car though surprisingly it's not as smooth as it seems | You just touch the gas slightly and it jolts | 
 "words": Purchased a 2 | 5SL to replace a 97 Civic coupe and have been very happy thus far | Car looks great is comfortable gets good gas mileage 28 mixed through 800 miles | mostly freeway is quiet and has good pep for a 4 cylinder engine |

 "words": This car is the best | I love it | Sporty looks nice colors to choose from love the keyless entry start storage cup holders auto windows up down more the 4 cyl has plenty of pep and I feel like I have a little bit of a luxury vehicle but at a great price | I compared to Honda Accord but it was kind of boring | I just kept thinkin about the Altima and I'm so happy I went with my gut feeling and chose this over the Honda | I have a child so needed a sedan for practical reasons but I still wanted something a lil sporty too and this is it | the two pipes out the back add to the fun look and I got the rear spoiler which is nice | Only wish I could get the fog lights |

 "words": Got it loaded minus nav | Only owned the car for a week with almost 200 on the clock | The ride is wonderful and the power is exceptional | It feels very athletic yet has the capabilities for a family car that I was looking for | I rated it slightly lower on build and reliability because I already have a squeak by the back seat and a strange clank in the engine compartment by the driver's side firewall | Almost sounds like some spring mechanism resetting | It only does it after each start up after cooling down when you are just starting to drive off | Very strange | 
 "words": I have had my vehicle for 1000 miles now and I am very happy with it | I looked at a variety of cars used Acura TL new Acura TSX Mazda 3 2010 and a Ford Edge | The Altima SL CVT with Bose is very comparable to the TSX but has a better body style and was thousands cheaper | The voice activation blue-tooth phone is very very cool | Wish the 2 | 5 had a few more horses for when the car has 4 passengers but it is sufficient | You can always step up to the 3 | 5 if needed for a couple grand | It also fits 5 passengers very comfortably |

 "words": Took our new Altima SL on its first out of town trip | Very uncomfortable passenger seating especially the poorly designed front passenger seat | The seat is only 8 from the floor and seat dimensions are too small for someone over 5'10 | Unfortunately we spent too much time worrying about engine performance and options and the test drive was not long enough to focus on this serious problem | We bought this for in town driving which is fine and for some out of town trips | It is physically painful to ride more than an hour | Very disappointed wish we had stayed with a slightly less responsive and a little more boring Accord or Camry that we considered |

 "words": Car has good acceleration and the CVT is nice | At cruising speeds if you need to pass somebody the power is always there | The one thing that I found very odd there is no radio in the base version | Dealer had to install one for me | Car looks good minus the wheel covers | I don't get that either | Engine noise is present but it's a 4 cyl so its expected | Push button start is cool | Display is cool | Overall it's a nice ride for the money |
