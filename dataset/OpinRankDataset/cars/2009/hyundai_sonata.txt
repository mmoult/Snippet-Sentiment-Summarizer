REVIEWS
 "words": Just bought my Sonata 5 days ago | traded a 2003 Mazda 6 s | The Sonata has been better than I could have hoped | Nice interior quietexcept suspension good stereo and very pleasant road manners | What really has been a surprise is the gas mileage | I used 5 | 25 gallons for 202 miles | That is better than 38 mpg and it was mixed driving and a new engine | I did have the dealership replace the original oil with synthetic before taking delivery
 "words": After less than 1000 miles the car started pulling to the left on any road or highway which isn't perfectly level | Speed doesn't matter-at low speeds the steering wheel make a 45 degree turn to the left on highway I can merge into the left lane by just letting go of it | Took it to the dealership 4 times alignment is ok rotated the tires but still no difference | Dealership checked with Hyundai if this is a known problem and said it isn't | Of course they say they can't do much more than that | Never had this problem with my 2 chevys and 08 Santa Fe on the exact same roads | Obviously this car has suspension and steer design flaws | At least mine is a smooth and quiet ride on any kind of street | 
 "words": I purchased my Sonata after looking at Nisson and Honda and the best buy for the money was the Sonata | I have a heavy foot on the gas and still get 32 mg on the highway | The best I ever got from my Toyota was 29 | The warranty is limited you have to read the fine print | 
 "words": All good finding new things on this machine every time out | Found take off in automatic a little hesitant but not used to drag race so ok | Did a little research anyway reading tech data | It makes since to me why now | Drive train is made to get max fuel economy w fare amount of horses | Using same 3 | 3L v6 added cvvt new injection system boosted HP and MPG Shiftronics all new f 2009 | Trans has special valve to somewhat control RPM surge in auto mode manual side no valve 1st geared lower | You control RPM's | Better jump don't hit car in front | Good f city driving | Also car has timing chain not stupid belt | Traction control is great when rain puddles on hiway | 
 "words": My first new car | Read a lot of reviews | Had a great deal rebate winter tires and other free goodies | Had it for 5 months and nearly 10k km on it | Went on a trip to Boston from Montreal and the car ran perfectly well | Very comfortable and roomy | Gas mileage on road is greater than expected | Bit disappointed for city mileage though | Had a burned tail light and the small door speaker unglued itself on the first month but got them fixed right away | No biggies | 
 "words": Less then 1400 miles one of the first things I did was change the air filter to KN seeing 23 MPG in town on the road I don't know yet but some mixed with mostly town 26 | More than enough pick up to get out of the way and starting in 1st | Very roomy good seats and driving position wish the seat bottom was a little longer but on any car I do | Easy to read gauges very strong brakes and great audio system | Of course the best warranty in the business doesn't hurt | Easy to get the steering wheel where you like with both tilt and telescopic | Wasn't really that hot about leather or the moon roof but I'm finding I was quite wrong | 
 "words": Just took a 2500 mile vac trip and had good millage thru out | Total ave | was about 29 mpg | I was disappointed with the harsh suspension due to the narrow profile tires it has | You do feel every pot hole | The drivers seat should have more back travel for leg clearance to exit from the car | The arm rest could extend forward a little farther for comfort | The blue trip scan gauge is very hard to read when lights are not used during the day and it is real bright out side | Color should be either orange or green | Slight hesitation on acceleration is very annoying | 
 "words": I was renting a Sonata GLS that was thru the insurance for 30 days as my car was totaled | I was impressed with the car and since I test drove a 2009 Sonata GLS for a month I talked myself into buying a Sonata Limited 2009 w o Nav | I paid 4375 below factory invoice that includes the 3000 rebate | Driving experience- suspension could be better but no biggie | Everyone talks in the reviews of great MPG 30-34 on highways | I have not seen much written about city MPG | Mine is around 19-20 MPG in City driving which is not that impressive | Hope it improves as the car just finished the break in period | On freeway it is 30- 32 and as soon as I get off the ramp it drops to 20-21 in just 10 miles | 
 "words": I have driven Camrys for the past 10 years so it took quite a leap of faith for me to purchase a new 2009 Sonata Limited | But after comparison shopping there was no contest | I got a great deal on my Sonata especially with the 3000 rebate on 2009 Sonatas the dealership could not have been easier to work with I run from high-pressure sales folksand the car I bought has a lot of very nice features including a V-6 leather interior sunroof great stereo and a very nice quiet ride plus excellent warranties | For the same price I paid for a new Sonata with all those features I would have had to buy a used Camry Accord or Altima and right around 2007 or even 2006 for the same features | 
 "words": Just finished a 6K mile trip out west | The car performed great | Got between 28 and 37 MPG | The 28 was doing a steady 81 with AC | The 37 was doing around 55 | Couldn't have asked for more of 175 horses | I enjoyed the trip | The car was quiet and we enjoyed the radio and music using a memory stick | 
 "words": I bought this car used with 11k miles on it | It has the option premium package with moon roof automatic lights trip computer electric seat | Got a great deal and now I can see why this car is fine on the highway and if that is all you basically do then fine buy it | But if most of your driving is in town on any road less than perfect then forget it | It is one constant busy bumpy and thunky ride with every imperfection in the road transmitted through the inferior suspension put into this car | After a week of this nonsense I finally had enough and took it back for another car | Fortunately the dealer allowed me to trade it without penalty | Be warned this car is terrible on city streets
 "words": I purchased this car a year ago and have written two reviews one when I first got the car and then another at six months | This will be my final review at a year old | I'm sorry to say but I now understand why Hyundai is not considered the same in quality as the leading Japanese manufactures | Not only have I detailed a number of options missing that the competitors offer but numerous problems have reared their ugly head in the past year | The 09 Sonata is a nice car but it's priced right where it should be | After my year experience with the car I understand why Hyundai does not have the resale value of the Japanese as well | Hyundai has made great strides but they have a ways to go | 
 "words": I've had my car since September last year and I've put a little over 8000 miles on it since | Though it's over 6 months old it still brings a smile to my face when I walk out to it | What it boils down to is that you can't get a better car for the price | The standard features beat the competitors in its class hands down even at a lesser cost | Comfort size safety | all excellent | Not quite as sporty as the Accord but more luxurious | so it's a price I gladly pay | I tend to have a lead foot as the saying goes so my fuel economy suffers | but that aside I don't feel I get decent MPG | I've gotten compliments from literally everyone who's been in my car | 
 "words": I am very pleased with the limited v6 the handling is very good hyundai did a excellent job with the 09 sonta limited those that have the models that are under the limited should have test drove the limited you would have been sold on it this car is very well put together with a very good ride and excellent gas mileage i am a premium gas man and my mileage is 32 on the hwy nothing to complain about this excellent car 
 "words": Purchased for size economy manual option and warranty | I have drive Subarus for 30 years but the Legacy is much smallerand has poorer mileage due to AWD | I have 6k in mileage | On recent trip to Kentucky I got 32 | 5MPG going around 70- 75mph | The only complaints I have are the manual trans is not as positive is shifting compared to Subaus I have owned and also Honda Accouds Civics and Mazadas I have driven which are owned by family members | Even my 86 year old mother drives a Civic with a stick shift | Hope the trans gets smoother as it breaks in | MPG has increased | Another strange issue is that when back windows are down at highway speed that there is a loud wind noise | 
 "words": This is my fourth Hyundai and my third Sonata and they just keep getting better and better | the new 4 cyl | has plenty of power but does it's business without harshness or excessive noise | Ride quality has improved noticeably and road and wind noise levels have improved | Haven't had it long enough to log my mpg | Will come back when that's sorted out | The exterior changes this year are minimal and add only a little to the already pleasant design | This car's forte is the new interior | Beautiful quiet comfortable spacious about sums it up | Kudos to whoever designs their interiors | 
 "words": I replace my 2005 Chevy impala with this car | My car payment went down 100 a month and I feel I got a better car | It 175 hp vs 200 it fills as quick and the ride's better | Gas mileage on Chevy 16 to 28 Hyundai 21 town 33 at 75 on highway | Love the ride and the head room I'm 63 lot of room in back for the kid's the dealership treat me like I got a BMW | I sold Honda's for 6 month and Hyundai has them worried if I didn't know it I would think I was diving a Honda accord | And not the Honda accord vp this car way better | 
 "words": Like the car very much except for the 6 crack in the front windshield | Had the car for 3 months and dealership said toooo badddd same as Hyundai | Drove a Ford for 10 years no cracks | Drove a Plymouth for 10 years no cracks | So which parts I'm going to have replace in the next 6 months | Just love their great so called warranty | 
 "words": When we picked up the car the navigation was not hooked up correctly and the dealer fixed it for us but it took three days signs of bad things to come | Less than a month later we took it to North Carolina and the nav system went out again | Dealer there was helpful and put in a new one for us | 8 months later it is not working again | It si a great car but I would not spend the extra for the nav system-they are not real helpful in getting it fixed and even when calling the help line they are not good at letting us know what is being done to remedy the problems | 
 "words": I have been test driving researching cars for 3 weeks prior to my purchase | I test drive the base models cloth seats nothing extra of all the following The Hyundai beat the pant off of the other cars I drove in price and quality | Incredible interior cloth seats value | Toyota Camry Tight steering responsive engine cheap dash especially the knobs | Seats average cloth on door arm rest worn at 30000 miles in every car I drove | Used 2008 2009 Camry 35000 miles costs more than a brand new 2009 Hyundai | Ford Fusion Absolutely horrible disgusting uncomfortable | Small leg width space ugly dash center console very uncomfortable seats because of the headrests | This is one of the worst | 
 "words": I own a 2007 Ltd and this 2009 GLS was purchased for my mom | I can tell you that based on my experiences the suspension was meant to be soft | It's not a flaw BUT it's something that will not give joy to everyone who drives one | People used to tighter suspensions | shop elsewhere | What I do have an issue with is the tires | They do not absorb bumps very well | The 17 wheels are worse than the 16 on the GLS | This is not a problem with suspension or shocks | The Kuhmo tires are harsh and noisy | Invest in better tires if it's that bad for you | Also check the tire pressure and make sure they're set as they should | Over under inflated tires can make a huge difference in ride | 
 "words": The Altima and Mazda6 are sportier the Camry and Accord have better resale value but nothing in the 25k price range beats the Sonata for value comfort and technolust | Standout features - iPod integration The auxUSB interface can charge your ipod and you can browse artists playlists albums etc on the display | The wheel mounted controls can be used to ffwd rewind and play next previous songs | No need to touch the ipod once its plugged in | Hood and trunk have struts | No chance of the hood dropping on your head no need to move stuff out the way of the trunk's hinges | The console and interior styling belong to a luxury car superb sound system | Crystal clear treble deep base
 "words": I just traded a 2007 Sonata Limited for a 2009 Sonata Limited | The 2007 was a great car but this is a fantastic upgrade | 
 "words": Like the overall car for looks and roominess inside | A little disappointed how the vinyl doors inside scratch easily | Sporty and stylish | 
 "words": My second Hyundai | Traded a 2006 Elantra for the 2009 Sonata | Feels like moving up from a VW bug to a Greyhound Bus this car is large | Love the quietness Michelin tires and great fuel economy | 
 "words": Overall great car | I don't like the latch you have to pull out and push in to tilt the steering wheel other cards I've owned you just move the latch | move the wheel and let go this you have to push the latch for it to engage the wheel in place | small item but bothersome | A small amount of road noise but then I can never tell the difference in noise from 25 mph or 70 mph | Great acceleration | 
 "words": The only complaint I have is the fuel door doesn't open very well | Also during the break in period the transmission shifted rough | Now transmission is starting to shift smoother | 
 "words": Only 1400 K on this so far and am looking forward to putting on another 300000 | Smooth acceleration quiet ride | I'm 6'6 and this car is comfortable for me | 
 "words": I drove the the Camry and Accord when shopping the Sonata has a much more comfortable ride | When pulling up to red lights next to Sonata's competitors I find myself feeling sorry for them that they settled for less | The Sonata is really well thought out in terms of design | I couldn't be happier | Thank you Hyundai engineers and designers | My daughter bought one just six days after I bought mine different color of course | She loves hers too | 
 "words": This will make the 6th Hyundai product that I haved owned since 2003 my last Hyundai before the 2009 sonata was a 2006 sonata se v6 | This time around I choose the 4 cylinder more for the economy purpose of the car | I am pleasantly surprised with the power and the changes that been made with the 2009 model | I now own the 2009 sonata limited and I think it blows away my previous car a 2007 Nissan altima 2 | 5sl | 
 "words": I only have the Sonata since October and I am very pleased with the interior of the car | However the gas mileage is significantly lower 18 mpg than what I was led to believe by the sticker 26 mpg | I feel like I was duped by the posted info | This car will never average 26 mpg | 
 "words": Not one to buy on price by can't ignore the value of the Sonata | Mind you will lose it on resale so not quite the bargain it seems | Interior is best in class for me | Materials not quite as good as Accord but layout way better | Seats fairly comfortable quiet ride | 249hp plenty for me I don't understand the need for 270 in a fwd family car | Fortunately seem to not have the suspension noise problem and roads are horrible here right now and tranny shifts OK | Chassis simply not as sophisticated and composed as Accord or Mazda6 | Seems chassis itself is not stout enough and the flex leads to some unsteadiness at speed despite stiff suspension | So far so good hope it lasts | 
 "words": The drive is very comfortable and smooth | I love the interior and all of the included upgrades | The warranty won me over all of the other cars in it's class | 
 "words": After driving this car for over 8000 miles I'm still pleased with what a tremendous value it is | GLS has all the options you need with popular equip | pkg | Pretty powerful for a 4 cylinder while getting great mileage for a car this size 27 mpg mixed city highway | Originally thought about civic corolla elantra but this car was a class up for the same price with incentives | Great interior | Very quiet car | ESC works great in the snow | Manually shifting the automatic works OK but upshifts are slow | Also it tends to downshift from 5th to 4th on even the slightest hill in cruise control on the freeway | Oh well | Seats could use more lateral support when cornering | 
 "words": Narrowed down my purchase to a Jetta or the Sonata and the Sonata just blew the Jetta away with features and lower cost | I also found the Sonata to be extremely comfortable with a very smooth ride | The iPod connectivity is great although there are some quirks with the software that could be improved | They also need to make the center console just a tad bigger to be able to hold a normal iPod well | The one area I have not been impressed with is gas mileage | I have routinely gotten about 22 MPG even with a good bit of highway driving | Not as good as I hoped but still much better than what I had before | 
 "words": Just bought the car a week ago | Very nice interior and moderate exterior styling | After researching many cars including Camry Accord Altima and Passat Sonata came in first on every thing on my list | Gas mileage is great getting above 35mpg on highways | Interior w blue lights are luxurious at night | Very quiet and smooth ride makes me wanna drive all the time | Overall Very satisfied with my Hyundai Sonata | 
 "words": Should have paid more for a car to have a decent ride these Kumho tires are stiff and out of round when cold the tires are worse | Doors unlock when car put into park so someone can jump into back seat and hijack someone | Nice feature with child lock for rear doors but even when that is on someone can open the outside doors and get in | scary for my wife when she is alone | Trunk items can't be secured from inside the car | 
 "words": Was tired of noisy poky 4 cyl cars and decided to go for broke with a top of the line midsized V6 | With gas at 4 a gallon had second thoughts about the V6 | Test drove the Sonata SE and was impressed | With the Limited V6 priced about 6K less than the Camry XLE or Honda EX decided to go for broke and use the savings for gas | Now that the price of gas has come down I'm delighted with the choice | Wife mostly drives it and loves it | 
 "words": My extended family and I have been buying leasing Chrysler Products for almost 10 years from the same salesman who recently began selling the cars made by HYUNDAI | A couple of weeks after he got to the new store Lee called my wife and I about this SONATA | I must say that although we never really paid attention to the brand before we are each impressed | for the cost of an entry level Dodge Avenger we have more standard feature's | A far more quiet ride | A great deal more room | We also looked at a few of the other cars offered by Hyundai after meeting a very considerate owner | We now are driving a wonderful new car |

 "words": After looking at the Sonata Camary Accord and Malibu on paper the Sonata appeared to be the best bang for the buck | Little did I realize that the bang would be felt over every bump in the road | There is a bad engineering flaw with the suspension of these cars | I do not know how anyone could be satisfied with the ride of a Sonata | I wish I had taken a longer test drive | I am stuck with a car that sounds like the shocks bottom out over every little bump in the rode | 
 "words": Drove the Camry and Altima the Sonata gives you the most for the dollar by far | For 1-2 grand less the the other cars you get leather interior xm radio moon roof individual temp controls and excellent interior trim and alloy wheels | Entertainment controls on the steering wheel | Not quite as quick as the Altima off the line but adequate power my last car was a turbo Huge trunk | The oil filter is on the right way so when change the oil you won't get an oil bath surprising how many cars have the oil filter upside down Smooth ride | I didn't experience any suspension noise going over bumps and highway speeds were just great driving | Dash is well laid out with easy to find controls

 "words": Have had this car going on 6 mos now | Have a little over 3000 mi | Have not had any problems to date | I was waiting to update my review until I had driven it in the snow | It did not disappoint me | The traction control ESC seem to do just what they were designed to do | And the Shift Tronic feature is helpful so you can use engine braking to slow the vehicle down on slippery roads | This car continues to impress me | Im averaging 32-33 mpg | If I get Sporty and use the Shift Tronic a lot | I'll drop down to 26-28 mpg | I honestly cant think of anything I don't like about it after 6 mos | 
 "words": I considered all the other makes before making this my final choice | I bought a base 4cyl with base options except bluetooth | Everything is standard | Unless you got to have leather and sunroof etc etc | you can not beat the deal | Even if you bought the top of the line limited your still ahead of the other makes | Car has plenty of power | Great gas mileage | Rides smooth and quiet | Build is superb | Only 2 minor glitches is headlights cast a weird line due to the projector headlights and motor has gotten louder since new but not something i would rush to the dealer for | Do your math and for 18K | good luck finding better priced in the same field | 
 "words": Following up an initial review I now have 10500 miles on the car after returning from a 2500 mile trip to Ohio in December | Needless to saywe experienced a mix of terrible winter weather including freezing rain and snow and the anti lock brakes and stability control performed flawlessly | this car is safe stable stops and handles great under all conditions | I deliberately slammed the brakes on on a deserted road covered with several inches of snow over ice and the car stopped without swerving or fishtailing at all | I never wished for more power even on long mountain upgrades and the mileage was 28-30 mpg overall | 
 "words": Well I have only had my Sonata 3 weeks | After trading in my 2002 Altima | I am very please with the design of the car in and out | I love the amenities | For the price I got my car for I could not pass it down | The car has a very soft ride which I had read about | But not too bad | Car engine seems much better in Shiftronic mode than in normal drive mode | Can't write much at the moment since the car is still pretty much brand new | 
 "words": I have 10k miles on my Sonata | I have not had the first problem | MPG is great | Even with my wife's heavy foot the car still gets 24mpg in town and we get 32 on the highway loaded down for a trip going 70mph | My GLS did not come with the auto on off headlights but you can still leave the headlights turned on all the time and they will go off when you turn the engine off and remove the key | If you have BMW taste then do not consider this car | But if value means more to you than people judging you by the coolness of your car then the Sonata is for you | 
 "words": After owning the 2006 and 2007 Sonata Limited during the past I was amenable to test driving the 2009 based upon several auto magazine reviews and 60000 combined driving miles | My 2009 Sonata Limited ranks among the very best autosincluding Mercedes BMW's Infinity Q45 etc that I have driven during the past 40 years | The ride is exceptional smooth handling secure road noise non-existent braking responsive without fade and highway entrance acceleration terrific | The interior is well appointedand XM radio stations crisp | In addition my combined gas mileage is over 26 mphand I often approach 31 mph on highway driving | My only two complaints are the navigation system blue odometer | 
 "words": Purchased one in Slate Blue in Nov 2008 after driving the Altima Accord and Camry | Recommend the Popular Equipment Package as it is worth the extra money | 4-cyl power is more than adequate | achieved 38 MPG at 60 MPH on a freeway road trip | Received many compliments on the exterior color | Interior is quiet and stereo is great w USB feature and XM Radio | Highly recommend this car so far as you get a lot of features for the price | 
 "words":  I was initially impressed with this car especially the price which was 16000 cash automatic and nothing else | I was in route to the Honda dealer but I passed by Hyundai and asked for a test drive | I should have kept going | The mileage is greatly overrated at least in my view | I have not achieved better than 18-19 MPG | It dos not shift very well and remains in lower gears too long | The ride quality is equally overstated | I feel every bump and pothole | It is a smooth ride only on well maintained roads | Otherwise the ride is very harsh | The build quality is not the greatest | I have noticed rattles and noises even on minor bumps | As I said I should have kept going | 
 "words": I took my time in my search for new sedan to replace the wife's Saturn SL2 driving just about everything available under 25K | Our main criteria were 1 larger and more comfortable than the SL2 I'm 6'4 2 automatic transmission 3 4-cylinder for respectable gas mileage our weekly commuting is 250 miles 4 leather seats 5 power adjustable driver's and passenger's side mirrors | After driving a dozen or so cars I cut my list down to the VW Jetta Mazda 6 Saturn Aura Nissan Altima and the Sonata | I think I would have been happy with any of these but when the price was factored in it became no contest with the Sonata beating them all by 2500-4500 | 
 "words": I test drove a Camry Accord Nissan 2 | 5s and Mazda 6 then Sonata last | I am a Toyota guy or should I say was | The Sonata was about 4k less at the start has better quality interior more HP under the hood is quieter and handles better than the Camry | It is not quite as crisp as the other three but it is a different drive | And it is so quiet inside nicely designed | So Toyota I am now a Hyundai guy | 
 "words": We bought this car to replace one of our 2006 Hyundai Accents | We're very impressed with the interior size as well as the interior furnishings and finish | I picked the four cylinder for the highway mileage and haven't driven enough yet to get some good figures | I'm very pleased with this car so far and can see myself fighting with the wife to see who gets to drive on a given day | The five-speed automatic transmission is great | Drives and shifts smoothly | It will tend to downshift while going uphill at highway speeds especially with the cruise control on | You have been warned | I suppose that's one of the trade offs for the EPA 32 mpg highway | 
 "words": Had to replace automatic on and off light sensor did not work when purchased | Carpet had to be replaced because of rips | After car warms up transmission shifts very roughly between 1st and 2nd gears and sometimes between 2nd and 3rd | I was told that the transmission was an inter active unit and would soon smooth out after the break in period | The car has over 6000 miles now and nothing has changed since the day I purchase it | Also it emits a foul rubbery smell from the heating or air vents | Smells like air coming out of a tire | If steering is turned to quickly to either lock position car will cut off | Bought to the attention of the dealer the shifting concern but was told this is normal

 "words": Went to a local auto show to look at buying a Camry Accord Altima or Malibu | I kept going back to look at the Sonata vs the other cars and concluded it was every bit as well built for thousands less | I did some more research and bought the Sonata | If all the cars were the same price I still would have picked the Sonata | The fact that it was thousands less was just a bonus and it has a warranty that the others won't even attempt to compete with | The car drives very nice and is very comfortable and quiet | The 4 cyl | engine delivers more than adequate performance and on a recent highway trip I got over 35 mpg | Great Car | 
 "words": I picked this up at the dealership where I work | After talking to the techs they all told me how well they ran and how reliable they were | I am seeing my vehicle get on average 24-26 miles to the gallon | I love my vehicle and I am glad I purchased it | 
 "words": I've had my 2009 Hyundai Sonata for about 2 months and I still love it | I was looking for a fuel- efficient has comfort with good interior and in low budget | I had everything I realistically needed in a car | Best of all is that it's MAINTENANCE-FREEoil and air filter change only in normal conditions for 60K miles | 
 "words": We went to World Car Hyundai Nissan | We test drove a base Sonata with an option package and we weren't totally adverse to the experience but we didn't like the interior fabric the paint color or the cheapo wheels | The dealer was running a sale this particular day it was also coincidentally the end of the month and it turns out that's a very good time to buy a new car | I found a silver blue metallic Sonata Limited with the four cylinder and they had a sale price on it of 21699 | Wow I thought | This is a nice car | In conjunction with 2000 customer cash from Hyundai we paid 2225 less than invoice | Good negotiators might still beat that price | 
 "words": Just ended a lease on an infiniti m35 and picked up the 09 limited v6 with nav | So far I have put 1800 miles on it including one 800 mi | Trip | I looked at the Camry accord and altima but went with the sonata based on reviews and price | I was out the door for just over 23k and that was with every option | The sticker was over 30k | I am getting just under 30 mpg on the highway and low 20's in town | Considering my last infiniti was just over 50k loaded and I could have bought 2 of these with money left over its an amazing deal | Just like Hyundai's advertisement say's think about it I am glad I did | 
 "words": I spent 4 months researching cars to replace my beloved GMC Envoy SUV | Everything else was too small or overpriced or didn't have stability control | And while I had my mind set on a 4 cylinder SE for the price and fuel economy a V6 came along as a dealer demo with 9500 miles on it | Thus it was cheaper than a new 4 cylinder and now I have a car with a super-powerful and smooth unbelievably quiet engine | The car now has nearly 11000 miles on it with no rattles | I'm averaging 24 mpg on my 12 mile suburban commute | I got 35 mpg on an all-highway trip | Great in the mountains | Great looks super comfortable very modern | Beats every car I've owned including a Passat |

 "words": After much research and comparisons we decided on the SE v6 this style gave us more standard options than any of the others | Plus several other options added at no extra charge add in the warranty and it was a easy decision | It may have a little less horsepower rating than some of the top competitors but unless you buy it to drag race or want to exceed 145 mph I think it is more than efficient | You get advantage of great gas mileage 32 | 5 hywaywould only wish I could have got that kind of mileage with my 63 Impala SS W SAME HP | BEATS OUR 2 | 5L V6 mAZDA by a long shot | Ride is awesome quite smooth and precise interior is great | Find a better deal than this buy it | 
 "words": This is our second Hyundai after having 2 prior Hondas | Our XG350 was a better travel car but our V6 Sonata handles better due to a less soft suspension and has 50hp more | Love the GPS and Bluetooth as well as the standard 350 watt Infiniti sound system | Our onboard mpg computer pegs in-town at 22mpg and generally 31-32 mpg on a flat straight highway like I- 20 | 5 year bumper-to-bumper and 10 year mechanical warranties will probably go unused |

 "words": I've read a lot of these reviews especially before I bought the Sonata | I am glad I did | For the money it is a great deal | The 32 mpg on the highway is right and that is with the AC on and 70 mph | It cruises nicely on the highway | Dash controls are easy and make sense | Back seat is roomy compared to others | Some reviews were unimpressed with handling and it is a bit soft but still very good | My only complaint is the suspension | it is clunky on a bumpy road | If Hyundai solves that issue they will have an unbeatable car |

 "words": The Sonata GLS with sunroof is a very nice car | The steering has very little feedback the springs bong each time I back out of the drive the AC works well and the engine is pretty responsive for a 4 CYL | The dash is generally fine the trunk is large | Nice car for the money |

 "words": After driving an SUV Ford Explorer then Mercury Mountaineer for the past 11 years wasn't sure I could get used to driving at a lower elevation | But I am very comfortable in my Sonata | Not to mention the smoother ride and great gas mileage | On a recent 400 mile road trip driving between 65 to 75 mph got 33 mpg | 
 "words": This is our second Sonata and the differences between the 2006 and the 2009 are amazing | They really listened to suggestions and incorporated them | It hesitates a wee bit like the 2006 did on acceleration but all things considered that's great for gas mileage | We're stuck on Sonata's | Great car great value |

 "words": Traded a '02 Elantra for a '09 Sonata | Nice step up | Got a great deal on the Sonata | It has every thing I wanted in a car | 4 cylinder performance is adequate | Of course more power would be nice but why sacrifice the fuel economy | I rented or test drove nearly all the competition and found the Sonata all things considered to be as good as any of them | When I factored in the price and warantee the Sonata comes out ahead of the competition | 
 "words": I bought the 2009 GLS 5speed earlier this month April and I love it | During my search I drove many similar mid-size sedans and I have to say that this is the best deal for the price | Unlike other entry level mid-size sedans the interior of the 09 Sonata does not feel cheap | The fuel economy of the 5speed is fantastic | The car handles well and has plenty of room in the interior for passengers | The trunk space is bigger than my first apartment | This is a great car fun to drive and a great price | I got the 2009 GLS 5 speed brand new for 14500 in Richmond VA |

 "words": Overall it's a very nice car | The interior feel is very upscale | My wife is not thrilled with backseat storage and there are only 4 cupholders 2 in the back seat arm rest but other than that it is a very nice car | Only 1100 miles so far | The mileage is a little lower than stated but I do a lot of short hop type of driving so I can understand that | Also weather has been cold chilly which also affects it and I probably haven't gotten past the break-in period | Other than that I love it | XM 3 month trial is very nice | The sound system and radio are awesome | You have to buy a 30 cable for the IPOD to work correctly but it's awesome | Ride could be a little smoother but overall is good |
