REVIEWS
 "words": This is the worst car I have owned | I should have kept my previous car | This car is good to look at but nissan compromised on quality with this car | I have been having mechanical problems since purchasing this vehicle and no one can seem to fix the problem | There is a thumping noise coming from the wheel area | The interior is missing simple things like coin compartment and sun eye glass holder | I am short and feel it lacks head room | the seats are horrible and the air conditioning heated driver seat is a joke | I am ready to trade in this vehicle in | 
 "words": This is my first Nissan and I must say that I'm in love | My previous two cars were a 2001 Mustang Bullitt and a 2003 VW Jetta GLI | I've been in many other cars and thus far the 2009 Maxima is my favorite | I actually look forward to running errands and driving to work | I bought the sports package and while some reviews say it's a harsh ride I disagree | The ride is excellent handling is as good if not better than my VW and road noise is very minimal | The bluetooth works great with my iPhone 3GS and while I haven't needed to use the GPS much what little I have used has been spot on | The acceleration is great for 290hp and a heavy car | I was told once to drive it like you stole it | 
 "words": I own a 1991 maxima which was the forefather of the 4dr sports car | I only have 35000 mile on it to date | I never thought there would ever be another maxima that would compare until now | Its not only better but it just blows everything away in its category | I may have had an old school vehicle but I forgot to mention I also own a 2008 acura mdx and a honda accord accord v6 | Honda has its homework cut out for itself | Its value holding segment has finally met its maker and its time for the honda salesman just standing there saying over and over its a honda and it holds its value poppycock | This maxima just does it all for a lot less then what it competes with | I don't need exotic badging | 
 "words": I have owned 5 Black Maximas | The last one was 2006 | It was a great car but BORING | The 2009 is just flat fun to drive | It is loaded with all the toys | rides a little harder than the 2006 but it does give the sensation of a 4DSC | I just got back from the mountains and it handled like a dream | MPG was OK but the RUSH I got from pushing on the accelerator probably did not help | Looked at Infiniti G37 Lexus 250IS and 350 and Acura TL | Lexus had the best ride but with comparable features to the MAX it got very pricey | Infiniti did not have the room and Acura was Acura I'm just not quite that old yet | For the money the Max was the best value and gets MAXimum ratings on the driving FUNOMETER | 
 "words": This Model has a very nice body style | Priced right and fun to drive | Until you make turns when i make left or right turns into a small dip or driveway at speeds of no more then 2 mph | The struts make a ugly sound they don't take the impact at all | I went back to the dealer 3 times a rep from Nissan took a look at it | For their fix they went to Home Depot brought a clear PVC tubing and weaved it through the struts to help with the bang | I still here the bang and this is the best they can do after 35K |

 "words": I upgraded from my 96 Honda Accord 4 Dr LX to a 09 Nissan Maxima SV SP | Although I liked the new design of the Maxima I was hesitant with the design of the rear but when I went to the dealership and saw this car in person it looks so much better especially with the rear spoiler on it | I got the Sport Package that has the 19in alloy rims and spoiler upgrade and it's is so beautiful | I am one of the few if not the only person to have this car in my area so far I see a lot of eyes and heads turning when I'm driving | 
 "words": I have a white one black interior fully loaded SV Sport corners like its on rails | The exhaust note | What you expect is NOT what you get | You get more | The 09 Maxima is a 4DSC | No doubt | The Maxima | s transmission takes some getting used to | Once hooked you begin to wonder why all cars are not build this way | 
 "words": My wife and I have been waiting on this car for quite some time | we traded in our 05 Maxima for the 09 and don't regret a moment of it | The feel and style the comfort the technology the thought that has gone into providing a true 4 door sports car is evident every time we get in to go somewhere | there are times we have to come up with excuse or reason just to go somewhere so that we can drive the car | My wife and I are Nissan fans anyway we own a 05 Titan as well | Purchasing the new Maxima was a toss up between the G37S or the Audi A4 | obviously the Maxima won | This car is truly the Nissan flag ship and should be crowned as the 2009 car of the year | Hands down great job Nissan |

 "words": After months of research and 3 weeks of test drives the purchase paid off | Before I bought my Silver on Black Max with premium package I test drove the Acura TL BMW 325i Audi A4 Infinity G35 and a few others | The Maxima was not hands down the better car in each category but lets look at what it gives you | It's not as fun as the BMW not as quick as the G35 I tested the rear wheel drive | It won't match the interior of the Audi | But the Maxima comes fully loaded at around 37k | It comes with the technology excellent navigation system easy to use interface layout cooled heated seats gas saver CVT 290 HP engine nice leather quite ride | 
 "words": Nissan really stepped up to the plate and hit a home run | This car is awesome | Why buy a fifty grand euro car when you get more for your buck with this beauty | I almost bought a M35X | The Maxima was good enough for me to reconsider the extra 12 grand I would have spent |

 "words": I purchased a new 09 Maxima after much research and lots of time looking and driving a few other cars | When I first decided to buy a new car my wife recommended a MAX because she has an 08 Well they are COMPLETELY different | This car feels roomier inside and even drives bigger | The exteriors also look separate | Overall if you want a car in this price range just go DRIVE a MAX and you'll end up taking one home | The tech features as well make it a hard car to pass by | Overall it's an awesome car and I wouldn't want any other vehicle in it's class | possibly even in a few classes above it |

 "words": Actually a great car EXCEPT it just quit in the middle of a parkway battery light came on and car stopped | Towed to dealer can't find anythingreplaced battery | Two days later car quits again this time a referburshed alternator put on note 8K miles on a 2009 also replaced wiring harness for alternator with after market not listed on repair order because they purchased seperately to wait for a new one from Nissan would take 3 days THEY didn't want to wait not me | Now I'm driving a car with 8K and a used alternator and who knows wiring harness Still no answer on why the alternator went out and the harness burned | I should have my head examined |
