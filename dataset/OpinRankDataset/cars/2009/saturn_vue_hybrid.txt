 "words": Ok so here is the deal with any car its like the lotto you have a very small chance of getting a lemon and yes I guess I must have got one | Avg 20 MPG combined with optimal settings per the book | Took to dealer service they stated anything from 20-30 was ok and that it could take up to 4K miles to break in the engine bullony I read the whole manual and advised the service manager that per the manual it says if the car stands for 3 months it can cause major damage to the hybrid battery and my car was sitting at the dealer lot for 8 months and only got 60 miles so he agreed to replace it we will see what happens I hope this resolves the problem | waiting to see savings |
