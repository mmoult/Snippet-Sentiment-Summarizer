REVIEWS
 "words": Buyer Beware of transmission problems | The transmission slipped on my brand new 2009 Saturn Aura at 347 miles | I had to have it towed twice | The dealership returned it to me and assured me there was nothing wrong despite the fact that I pulled out in front of traffic and could not accelerate | I was told to | pull off to the side of the road shut off the engine then restart the car to 'reset' it | After this occurred the third time I did as instructed then drove it to the dealership and left it there | I insisted it was dangerous and I was now following the GA Lemon Law | They replaced the transmission at approximately 700 miles | I would rate my experience with Saturn a big 0 | 
 "words": I purchased a new saturn aura xe on April 30th | On Aug 6 vehicle had to be towed as to transmission problem | Vehicle returned as repaired on Aug 7 and had to towed again on the 7th | Saturn Corp over the next 32 days literally lied about what the problem was and when the repair would be completed | First they said the part was coming from Germany | Then they couldn't locate the part | After numerous calls we learned that the Dealership that was to make the repairs had given up their Saturn line and switched to Mazda and couldn't repair our vehicle even if they received the part | Saturn Corp lied from the start | Doing the right thing from day one Ha Ha Ha 
 "words": Purchased a Saturn Aura XR-4 after coming off a Lincoln Zephyr lease | I was looking for better mileage without sacrificing comfort | So far I am happy with the Auras performance | Ok its not a Lincoln but the drive is comfortable and the 2 | 4 four cylinder gives me enough power and speed thanks to the 6 speed tranny | The interior is a little cheap and I agree the buttons on the steering wheels are small but I new this going in | This car has just about everything bluetooth moon remote start leather Onstar XM | It actually has more feature than my Zepher had | The price was very attractive | The exterior is eye catching | If your looking for an affordable midsize give the Aura a look | 
 "words": At first I thought perhaps I was being hypersensitive but the more I drive may Aura 3 | 6 engine the more I hate it | I initially considered taking it in to see if something was wrong with it but I had a 4cyl loaner for a day and it was even worse | I looked on the blog to see what others thought and the very first review I read summed it up the transmission hunts and it is jerky | It is so jerky that it feels like you are driving a stick shift but you have not control over it | I am so upset about spending big bucks on something that makes me nauseous to drive I wish I could return it | 
 "words": I love my new used Saturn Aura | When I drive it people take a second look | Not at me the car | I love the stylish rims and the leather is beautiful | I bought this car and it was spotlessly clean | It has lots of pick-up and speed | Of all the vehicles I test drove this was the car | I saw it drove it bought it | I knew the minute I saw it this was the car for me | 
 "words": I love the style and comfort the whole package is amazing could not be happier | 
 "words": I agree with another review that this car's transmission hunts is too quick to downshift and would add that it feels erratic jerky especially at low speeds | had it checked by dealer they say that that | s how it works | Also agree that steering wheel control buttons are too small and hard to use | I would add an item that was not in other reviews | The aerodynamics seem flawed | when travelling at 50 mph or faster and only the rear windows is are opened the closed front windows and closed sunroof vibrate badly and the air pressure in the car is such that it is painful to the ears | Dealer's solution crack the front windows or sunroof | this is not acceptable fix in my opinion | 
 "words": Traded Acura for new XR V6 | with every option except engine block warmer | Love the look of the car | and the classy brown-leather interior | I'm 6'4 and the drivers position is a little cramped compared to the Acura | The position of the heated seats switch causes some problems | you turn it on with your legs getting in car | it would have been better in the center | The ignition switch on the dash also is awkward | because to reach it you almost always turn on the wipers | These things are minor | but could use a re-design | Gas mileage is better than advertised | so far | Dealer service has been excellent | 
 "words": I have not had a good experience with this car or this company | I have always owned a GM car this being my first and last Saturn | The car hasn't worked right in the year I've had it with a multitude of electrical problems and common defects | The company has been impossible to work with and overall I would have rather switched to a Pinto over this mess of a car | Watch yourself if you're looking at this car | 
 "words": Bought this car new for my wife after her 2006 Saturn Ion52K flawless miles | At 3k miles this Aura is also flawless | My wife loves it she says even more than she loves me and in Ocean Mist turns heads wherever she goesshe says it's her | of course I have learned never to argue with a statement like that | 
 "words": forget the policy of no saturn discounts | i got 2750 off list plus was allowed to use 2000 in GM credit card rewards | this turned a 26933 car into about a 22000 car | Moroccan leather interior and sunroof included | Classy very classy
 "words": I was looking for a mid 20k priced vehicle and found it with the Aura | Good features and ride excellent build quality | It's economical and good on the environment low emissions | While it is only a 4cyl it accelerates very well merging onto the highway | Gas mileage is close to what was advertised and I only have 1000 miles on it so far | Looks much more expensive than it costs | I looked at the Malibu I like the Aura's looks betterAltima Jetta Camry Sonata cheap feel and Fusion I would also have bought the Fusion if not for the GM saved me on a pull ahead program | 0 interest rebates and got 3 yrs maint thrown in too | Often gets mistaken for an Acura or Audi on the street | 
 "words": Have owned a string of Hondas Nissans and Toyotas and the Aura competes well with these vehicles while coming with more content at thousands less price | It was initially difficult to accept that it was a GM car | The 4 cyl performance works on hills and entering highways | Ride is quiet and will get better once OE tires are gone but that will take a long time | Mileage results so far support the EPA estimates | Looks great particularly since it comes with 17 wheels | Front seats are comfortable and adjust to fit electric | Bluetooth for phone is a plus | Vehicle had preferred and convenience packages as no cost options | 5 star across safety | 
 "words": We've owned over 30 cars trucks over the years what with ourselves and a family of young drivers | We owned Nissan Toyota Renault Chevrolet Pontiac Dodge Plymouth Mitsubishi and a few more | We had a nice Toyota Sienna mini van and the last we bought in a foreign brand | It had it's problems | But we still shopped and drove a Toyota Camry Mazda 6 and Saab 9-3 | We really liked the Mazda and Saab | The Camry didn't seem as great a car as it has been talked up | Plus the price even with low interest | The Saturn Aura XR-4 won hands down for price features safety and fuel efficiency | We got an Aura XR-4 6 speed automatic 
 "words": I think Saturn GM hit a home run with the Aura | It's sleek in an everyman's kind of way has more useful gadgets than my toolbox and the economy is outstanding | On the highway with cruise control at 70 I consistently enjoy 38 mpg | that's darn good in a non-hybrid mid-size sedan | The 2 | 4 liter 4-banger does just fine and I live in the mountains of course I'm not trying to jump every car off the line | The 6 speed automatic is smooth as glass although with a bit of throttle hestitation you do have to get used to it | I find the interior to be quite well done and ergonomically laid out | The seat fits me well and has proven quite comfortable on a 6 hour trip | I give Aura an A- | 
 "words": Problems with this car 1 Transmission hunts is too quick to downshift and feels erratic | 2 The seats are very uncomfortable for any distance driving 3 Seat adjustment is limited I'm 5' 10 and felt like I was on top of the headliner 4 Windshield rake and seat make the rear- view mirror a giant obstacle to see around | It's a blind-spot facing forward | 5 Steering wheel remotes for cruise and radio are too small and hard to use during night-driving | 6 Interior components that scream I'm cheap plastic combined with lousy fit and finish |
