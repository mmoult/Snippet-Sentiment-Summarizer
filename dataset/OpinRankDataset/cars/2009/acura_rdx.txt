REVIEWS
 "words": My wife got the car and she seems happy with it but I think the lack of visibility out the back is dangerous | The rear window is very small and then further blocked by the driver's headrest | Visibility out the driver's side is also bad because of the frame between driver and passenger windows | The real problem is the delay in acceleration which is maddening | Delay is usually 1 second but if you really need to pull in front of a car to make an exit you need to know it may the sequence which is engine revs wait a second wait a second and then car accelerates but not quickly | I can't believe this is supposed to be a premium car | Also high hood blocks forward view a little | 
 "words": I've had my RDX for nearly three years on a lease and I will be turning it in and not getting another | The gas mileage is well below what is listed at 17mpg in town | I live in Boston and drive around town and get about 11 12 miles per gallon and I'm not a lead foot | The Turbo is not as responsive as it should be there is some lag but it is not bad when it kicks in | Just not as perfect as the sales people tell you it is | The interior is basic | Visibility is routine | Body design is nice | But the interior trim is just an upgraded version of a Nisson X-Terra | I question if my leather seats are really leather | They remind me of the Mercedes leather- like material I had in my Turbo D | 
 "words": I love this car | I have an Acura MDX too but this thing is fast | The seats are very comfortable cabin noise is minimal | I do not understand the poor mileage complaint | I have driven the car for last 7000 miles and I have consistently gotten around 22 mpg | Nice leg space in rear seats | Good sound system | Great value for money and without sacrificing the fun part | Fast acceleration when needed | If you are looking into CR-V or RAV4 with all options please buy this instead | Worth it | Nice ride too | Truly not bumpy at all | They must have and 'have' softened the suspension since the original 2007 model | Its as good as any other SUV | 
 "words": I absolutely adore this SUV | I drove a mid-size sedan for many years and it did take some time to adjust to the RDX | The tilt down mirror on the passenger side is wonderful when backing | The interior is well laid out with all of the controls within easy reach | The center console is deep it holds my large purse with room to spare | The front seats are comfortable and there's ample knee space in the rear with the front seats all the way back | Ride is firm you feel some of the bumps and hear a little road noise but the fun factor outweighs any of this | Fits my small family perfectly | Represented an excellent value for the money compared w competition | Currently get 19 mpg city | 
 "words": This is not the luxury car that Acura should be selling | Unlike other Acuras the vehicle does not have automatic headlights a basic safety and convenience feature available on similar and many far less expensive cars | The gas mileage is far less than advertised | It is very difficult to open the rear door | The instrument panel particularly the radio controls are poorly designed and difficult to use | While the turbo engine is very good and the ride is decent the car is not what I have come to expect from Acura they should be ashamed | 
 "words": This is a jazzed up Honda at best | By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury in fact an Accord V6 may be more luxurious | That being said it's all about performance in the RDX and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV | The RDX is the best driving small SUV out it's faster handles better and has fantastic steering new editions like the Q5 will give it a run but its price keep it from being shopped together | 
 "words": I just picked up my new RDX I LOVE IT | I traded in my 10 yr old Saturn which I loved low maint | great reliability but wanted an upgrade in quality interior features etc | I do a lot of driving the RDX has NOT disappointed so far | I read a LOT of reviews before buying I have to say that the ride is a little rough but was expecting the sporty drive so I don't mind it | I have to respectfully disagree w complaints about the fuel economy | My 4-cyl Saturn ave | 30mpg so I was prepared for a big bite into my fuel budget | Have put about 200miles on the RDX so far and I'm ave | 25mpg 60 hwy | Not bad | I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it | 
 "words": I got my RDX tech for around 32k taxes | I think for the price the feature content is great | I don't know why people think it rides harsh I think the ride handling balance is just right sporty and confidence inspiring without being too harsh or floaty | The worst thing about this car is the omission of a couple cheap-but-nice features and the fuel economy which could have been better if they put the V6 under the hood | It's got more than enough power to deal with traffic | 
 "words": Have owned the SUV for one year and 18k miles now | Fun to drive good visibility excellent handling and did real well in the New England winter | I am not a very aggressive driver and don't use the paddle shifters much | I do a mix of highway and city driving | I am averaging 21 mpg | The rear suspension is very firm which could be uncomfortable for rear adult passengers on longer trips | I owned another Acura five years ago | I was disappointed with the fit and finish of my SUV | Total of three trim pieces on the dashboard and passengers door panels were replaced under warranty because they became loose | Had to also take it back for rattling sound behind the glove box | 
 "words": I have been driving this car for about a month and I have really enjoyed every moment in it while at the wheel | It accelerates and runs great | The turbo engine is amazing | My wife and I like the RDX exterior and interior | The ergonomics is virtually perfect | I think the RDX is one of the best buys on the SUV market | 
 "words": RDX is my first SUV | It has roomy interior and handles quite nice for its size | The ride quality is not for everyone since it is stiff sport suspension | It's supposed to be an entry level luxury SUV but I don't really see that | Hope Acura pays little more attention to finish quality since interior rattle is really annoying | 
 "words": My lease had come up on my 05 Infiniti FX35 | a beautifully designed and performing vehicle | I looked at the BMW X3 the Infiniti FX35 and the Acura RDX | The obvious question was what was I going to have to give up to move to a less expensive vehicle | Surprisingly | not much | Negatives on the RDX no automatic headlights strange | almost awkward styling poor mileage no compass very basic rims rough ride for some strange cargo cover | Big Positves | Sports car handling and acceleration awesome AWD system look at it this way | if money wasn't an object I'd be deciding between the BMW X6 or the FX50 | Saving some money and not giving up the farm feels pretty good | 
 "words": Just purchased this vehicle yesterday and just wanted to say that my family and I enjoy every feature | Very quick in response off the line | Can barely feel the gears shift | Interior very well designed | Many fun options even with a base model | Why spend 4000 more for a nav and a couple extra speakers | Handling is great | Gas mileage is to be expected from having a turbo installed | To anyone else complaining about this you should do your homework first | Besides wouldn't want to give your car the best of the best servicing | That's what makes cars last longer | Take this for what it's worth yet this car is a great small family vehicle | 
 "words": I have had my Acura for 2 months now and have close to 1800 miles | I have had a rattle on the left hand side of the car since 65 miles | I am bringing it back to the dealer again next week | The cars mpg has never gotten over 16 | It is the winter in WI | It handles well in the snow but not any better than my BMW 525XI was | The interior parts are very cheap | It is very bumpy in the city and drives like a jeep wrangler | I had better expectations from this car | It is not of a near luxury type of car | I lease it and have to drive it for another 34 months | I was recently in a Ford Escape that did not rattle like mine and had a quieter ride | Dealer apologizes but tells me I shouldn't expect much | 
 "words": Came off of an A6 4 | 2 lease wanted to downsize and have more fun while allowing my middle-aged body to lift the children into the rear car seats without back break | High center of gravity concerns moot at anything up to 7 10ths driving i | e | public roads because of flat cornering and absorbing suspension | Absorbing as in GTI not Buick | Also useful in deeper snow | It's not a sports car or sedan but it's a a brilliant urban suburban commuter actually fun on a twisty parkway | Seats are surprisingly good | Tighter body structure on rough roads than an X3 no Audi suspension crash | No Audi interior leather or BMW brakes or steering either but not enough difference to justify 15K
 "words": Just got my Acura RDX overall I like the truck | 0-60 is great and mileage is decent | Build quality is excellent and the cabin is very quiet | However I am disappointed in the way it handles in snow the car tends to lose rear end during turns in snow especially if you take the turn fast | I was expecting esp would help but it does not | However in a straight line the truck is solid | 
 "words": Originally we were set on a wagon to replace both a Pathfinder and a Saab sedan | However when you look at what's out there in similar trim levels new Saab Audi BMW Volvo they get comparable gas mileage with just a bit more room but for 10K more | That made the RDX a no-brainer | Yes it has a firm ride it's on the sport side of SUV | It's much better than a truck-based SUV such as my PF and by giving up a Caddy-like ride you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling | Yes gas mpg isn't the best but it also has a turbo that has zero lag with effortless acceleration and is no worse than other crossovers | This car's not for someone wanting a boring town runabout | 
 "words": This is my fourth Acura | The last being an MDX | While I realize this is an entry level SUV the quality and luxury of Acura has been scaled down on this vehicle | When my Lexus RX350 lease ended I didn't want to get the same car twice and the MDX has gotten to big with no more kids or large dog to haul around | There some features left off of this Acura which should be standard issue i | e | automatic headlights and power rear door rain sensing wipers | The gas mileage is ridiculous | We celebrate when I can hold the average at 19 mpg for more than 10 minutes and that is with freeway driving | I will not purchase another RDX | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle for a litle over 2 months now | Just got back from a ski trip with the family | First let me say the SHAWD is the best AWD system I have ever had | The vehicle handles snow like you are on asphalt | Mileage is all in how you drive I am getting between 21 to 24 mpg combined with conservative driving | Beware that the suspension is stiff trade-off the vehicles handles very nicely | 
 "words": I have only had this car for a few days but I LOVE it | I have always loved Hondas and I have wanted AWD drive for years so this is the perfect mix of fun and safety | The turbo and handling are impressive | It's like a sport sedan with higher clearance AWD and more trunk space | 
 "words": Just purchased compared to BMW x3 and Mazda C7 | I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency | Looked at Subaru WRX WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family | The Acura is loaded with options well built solid comfortable enough | Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive | I am surprised they don't market this differently | Turbo 4 banger SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber snow is good | I can also fit kids wife dog etc | Very happy with performance technology is overdone voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level
 "words": I | ve been on just about every type of terrain and this SUV has performed admirably | Highway and street ride and performance is great | Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged | On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG | Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing | In the city MPG is closer to 18 | On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well | Dirt roads are the same | I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle | Almost every feature you need is included | 
 "words": Let me say that I love Acuras because of the value you get with the car | No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price | All the toys work and make this a great car to drive | It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG | It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get | This is not a luxury sedan | What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven | 
 "words": Very disappointed poor value for the price | Seats are uncomfortable I'm 5'10 always hitting my thigh on steering wheel | nav system very complicated | voice recognition never accurate say go home and nav responds with air conditioner off | Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position if wheels are not straight you will have problems turning the key in the ignition | Gas mileage is awful | acceleration certainly not 'peppy' | requires premium gas | oil changes require synthetic oil | Bought this car outright not leased | After 2 months I am considering getting rid of this car and buying something more comfortable with better nav mileage | 
 "words": This is not my first Acura | These vehicles are designed to be a balance between value and luxury | Are they German engineered NO | That said they are good performers with great reliability | This is a fun vehicle to drive loaded with features that would be costly options on other brands | Fuel economy is based upon how aggressively you drive and the car is not going to magically transform into something else after to take it home so give it a good test drive | 
 "words": I bought the car looking at the Mazda CX7 Nissan Murano etc | Actually found that the RDX is only a bit more expensive then the Mazda so I went with it | The look and interior is awesome but its way to stiff | Every pothole makes the car jump it feels like an old school jeep | I bought it for comfort and luxury but this is way to jeep | It really gets annoying even embarrassing sometimes | I really love the car otherwise but this is a major flaw | 
 "words": Having leased 2 MDXs over the past six years I had no reason to look outside the Acura line to lease a new vehicle | I did however want to economize on lease payments and no longer needed the additional space and seating of the MDX | The RDX really fills the bill | Super handling great performance and real comfort for the driver and front seat passenger | The traditional Acura safety features and interior appointments are apparent | The voice activated tech package is awesome tho requires familiarity | This is just a feel good vehicle to drive | 
 "words": I drove the RDX 2x before deciding to buy and I sincerely regret it | There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying | The gas mileage has not improved with time only getting 13 mpg | The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash | The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine | The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid | Other Acura models have this feature except RDX | For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW | Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options but they make a great driving machine | Acura in my book has a long way to go | 
 "words": First SUV I own and very pleased with it | They did a great job to reduce the turbo lag | you can notice it but it is definitely acceptable | Very good looking SUV with the luxury touch you find on all Acuras | Looking forward to try it in snow here in Boston | 
 "words": What a blast to drive | Hugs turns like a sport luxury sedan and pulls off the stoplight like Old V8s I have owned | 
 "words": Have less than 1000 miles on the car and averaged 22 mpg on the second tank of gasoline with both town and highway driving | The turbo comes on quick if you need it | We like the stiff suspension and look forward to the AWD during our long Alaska winters | This is our third turbo car and they just keep getting better and better | Enjoying the memory power seats and mirrors with two drivers of different heights | With the easy to fold-down rear seats it provides plenty of room for those shopping trips | We spent a year looking at various crossovers and the RDX always moved to the top of the list | We keep our cars 12 years and look forward to a long term relationship | 
 "words": First the RDX is NOT a luxury auto by any standards | The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint | On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle | I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else | I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX | Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response well it is based on a truck so I don't expect future models to address the ride |
