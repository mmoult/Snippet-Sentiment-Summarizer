REVIEWS
 "words": Traded in a 2007 Chevy Colorado for the Suzuki | I have had nothing but pickups for the last 12 years or so and was always happy | until the Colorado but that is another story | I decided on an SUV for the cargo capacity and wanted something compact and different | Back in the 90's I had a Geo Metro and my wife had a Geo Tracker both were very well made and reliable so it was a natural to go to the Grand Vitara | I love this SUV very well made comfortable and looks great | The only problem is a 16 gallon gas tank | Averaging 25 MPG the tank is too small | Also the radio stinkstoo dim | Would I do it again | At this point yes | You are cheating yourself if you do not look at this SUV | 
 "words": just bought mine so this quality reliability rating is irrelevant | All the reviews suggest the only small X overs you can actually take off road are Subarus and the GV and the GV is incrementally better off road | That was my deciding factor despite reliability concerns | Always owned Hondas which have been bullet proof | My X Sport has true 4X4 w lower gearing | I wanted the 6 cylinder with its addtl off road capability but they are sold out in my region | I NEEDED to buy Suzuki has 3K rebate and Sept sales were awful so dealer was willing to deal so I decided not to wait for 2010s | The GV price was right the interior is nice it has some off road chops | we'll see about reliability | 
 "words": We purchased this car thinking it would be as good and reliable as the Honda we traded in | Big mistake | After 6 trips to the repair shop and many telephone conversations to the customer relations department the problems remain unfixed | The warranty is not worth the paper it is written on | We had problems from day 1 | The dealer finally admitted there were problems but was not capable of fixing them so customer service sent us to another dealer | They are unable to fix them also | We have not been able to travel any distance all summer and we certainly would not carry our precious grand children in this unsafe car | Please learn from our experience and do not buy a Suzuki | 
 "words": Getting 26 | 1 MPG in my first 3000 miles of mostly highway driving pretty good for 4WD | I like the standard doohickeys keyless entry sunroof 6 disk cd | Really good price no competition from its competitors especially with the 3000 incentive | Bought the SX4 last year gave that to my daughter upsized for more room for me | 
 "words": I like this vehiche very much powerfull and strong made desing
 "words": The car is a real off-roader in its class | Off the pavement it beats RAV4 HR-V Santa-Fe and probably MItsubishi though I'm not sure about that one | Besides its off-road capabilities it's nothing else | Nothing | It's not a road warrior despite of interior creature comforts | I love the interior and visibility a lot but darn it is noisy | It is the engine noise I'm talking about | You can't escape it especially up the hill | It sounds like another second and the motor will explode out of the hood | You definitely have the feeling that the car is underpowered for its weight and the engine struggles a lot to pull all that weight up hill | Other than that it's a decent car full of defects | 
 "words": With only 15K on the vehicle I can't say much about reliability but they got everything right the first time | I also have a 08 XL7 with 40K and neither has ever been to the shop xcept for routine maintenance | One of the first things I did was check out the 4x4 capabilities and I was surprised how well it did | My only complaint is not enough clearance and no skid plates | I have seen some complaints about gas milage but I am really happy with it | Although some x-overs may do better it does well for a true 4x4 | I am doing better than most people will ave | 23 | 5 this winter and 24 | 7 since the alcohol was removed for the summer | I do drive 95 highway miles | Overall I love it | 
 "words": I purchased a 2001 Suzuki Grand Vitara with 120259 miles off the street | Well I have to say that this vehicle from the start did not let me down | The performance was is fantastic steering and driving has been an absolute joy especially on overdrive it takes off like an airplane | I love the Suzuki Grand Vitara so much that I went out and purchased a 2009 model | It has everything I want in a small SUV with plenty to spare | I have not driven my new Grand Vitara yet but my expectations are greater | 
 "words": Great little SUV | I wanted a compact SUV that was an actual SUV not a crossover so I took a look at this vehicle | Interior materials and quality is top notch and its very comfortable to drive in | Heated seats warm up nice and quickly | Great styling | Engine is nice and peppy | Gauges are superb and easy to read | Brakes are good | Drives like its on rails even in snow | Very maneuverable in tight spots | Takes potholes without worrying about getting a flat tire | I bought the GV because of terrible roads in the winter and the potholes that only seem to spread more and more as well as for off road and towing | Gas mileage is not bad at all averaging 20 mpg so far | Take a look at it you will like it | 
 "words": I am glad we decided to buy this suv | The vehicle is very solid and fun to drive | The mileage in the city is around 21 mpg with the four cylinder that should improve with time | Seems to be a great value for the money | Take one for a test drive before you count this vehicle out | 
 "words": A great engine I like this suv thats all it has a great price and grat value | 
 "words": I had a bad experience with my second suzuki | I had it four days then the motor locked up | Four days of decent driving then out of the blue kerwham | The dealer has had my car now for 27 days I keep thinking maybe tommorow ill get it back | its comfortable | The gas mileage it gets is terrible I understand there is a breaking period however 7 miles to a gallon is terrible | I am driving a old 1977 ford truck that gets 19 mpg | Anyone in the market for a 2009 Grand Vitara with 247 miles on it |
