 "words": I just found out my AC condenser leaked all the freon due to a stone impact | The openings in the front grille measure two inches by three- quarters of an inch | This design allows stones to impact the condenser directly behind the grille | The 1300 repair cost should be covered under warranty but it's NOT | I bought a new car so that I wouldn't have to pay for these kind of repair costs | Buyer beware |

 "words": Our 2009 Sienna is everything we had hoped for and then some | For the first 16000 miles we have averaged 22 MPG not bad for a big car that drives so easily | This is also the first car we have ever owned that has not needed a repair for some sort of flaw | It has been perfect in every respect and we are beginning to wonder if the 100K extended warranty was worth the extra cost | 
 "words": We live in New England | AWD was important to us in purchasing this van | Also the crash test results and the awesome reliability record of this van was the deciding factors for us | The gas mileage is not the best as noted by several reviewers here | But you have to consider that this is a large vehicle with a large V6 engine AS WELL AS AWD option | The AWD adds 2 or 3 hundred pounds to the weight of the vehicle | The gas mileage will suffer | If you want higher mileage you can go with the FWD option or get a smaller vehicle | The vehicles drives beautifully it has a tighter turning radius than most mid-size sedans it is relatively quiet on the road and handles well for a minivan | 
 "words": Open the door on the Sienna and you are in for a shock | The XLE with leather interior looks as good as any luxury car on the market no matter what you spend | The next surprise is the performance | awesome | This 266 hp V6 would blow away 90 of the guys next to you that think they have hot cars | Highway acceleration is every bit as impressive | Ride will match nearly anything on the market | The turning radius is mind-blowing | The negative Visibility stinks | I've almost had a few accidents | Hood must be propped open to stay up | How cheap on a 30K plus car | Tranny shifts a bit hard at times and has minor surges | Paint chips easily | Needs pinstripe or something to jazz up the outside |

 "words": We just traded in our '03 Odyssey EX-L w DVD for an '09 Sienna XLE w DVD leather xtras | I thought my Odyssey was the ultimate family friendly car but this is even better | The Sienna is very well thought out with lots of storage compartments scattered about | Very easy for 3rd row passengers to get into with tumble-forward 2nd row seats | The drive is very smooth and car like | With the Ody I often felt there was a huge amount of car behind me | The Sienna is a significantly quieter inside than the Ody | All the seats are very comfortable | I really like the center console in the front row it has a deep center storage bin that is perfect for the DVD headphones |

 "words": Just purchased my new mini-van yesterday | What a blast | I only have about 30 miles on the van at this point | The location of the instrument panel is ergonomically excellent | The option package is awesome but requires some study to operate with aplomb | The interior looks Rolls like in quality | and fit and finish | The exterior styling is good but no match for the interior's Rolls look | The engine is more than adequate and powerful and matches the transmission which is smooth as silk | I was really surprised by the tight turning radius of the vehicle | When driving this van I automatically think I am in a luxury automobile costing tens of thousands more than the actual cost | 
 "words": Just traded in our 07 Odyssey EXL-RES after 1 years use for the AWD option on the Sienna | We have approx | 500 miles on the Sienna | Over all the Sienna instrumentation controls are much more intuitive hated the Ody instr | Ody felt big and bulky but did give a very comfortable ride | Sienna's ride is a bit stiffer but much more responsive gives the driver a better feel of control and is quite comfortable | Very good visibility | Heat on our Sienna is very poor in cold weather 32F and never seems to get comfortable in cold | We do all short hop drives and expected poor mileage but our 14 MPG is a bit ridiculous | Hope this will change after the break-in | Would not go back to the Odyssey |
