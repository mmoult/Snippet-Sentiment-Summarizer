REVIEWS
 "words": Had for 15 months | This car is awesome | I cannot understand any complaints except for maybe gas mileage | It's what you should expect for a large sport sedan | Infiniti service and dealership was still is excellent | In out the door in less than an hour | Will keep this vehicle for a long time | Sporty classy comfortable and people love looking at it | What a deal | 
 "words": Well I needed to replace our Buick and with GM going down the toilet I figures I better move to the Japanese | Spent 3 months looking for a luxury car | Anyway I walked into the Infiniti dealership here and the friendliness was fabulous | They had an 08 M35x that the manager was driving with 18000 kms in sandstone | What a beautiful car | We drove it for a day and were hooked | They gave it to me for 20K less than new | They gave me 10K for my Buick and I was stunned | I drove this out of there in mint condition for 30K Canadian | WOW I couldn't buy a v6 accord for that | Driving the car for a month now and am awestruck by the quality | This thing is a tank | Put new Michelin Pilot Pluses on WOW | 
 "words": I dreamed of getting an M35 for years so you'd think I ran a great risk of being disappointed by such high expectations | Like almost every Christmas which never lives up to my visions | The M is better than I could have imagined | I do wish it got better mileage but my average mpg of 22 combined is just fine for what I am getting to drive | 
 "words": Wow | What a fun car to drive | I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment I get into my car | Plenty of passing power handles like a sport car and I love the firmness of the suspension | This is truly a luxury sports sedan for a person not looking to buy a 2-dr sports car | Everything I am looking for in a sports sedan | The interior is beautiful and everything is laid out nicely | Plenty of room front and back | Did I mentioned the car handles awesome | I love the way the car look | very clean | 
 "words": For what would otherwise be an under-powered luxury sports sedan that is an excellent value the steering issue called tramlining makes the M35X an unsafe highway car | Everything else is wonderful comfort electronics etc | 
 "words": Right after Thanksgiving my local dealer was having a big sale and I bought an 08 M35X | Drove it home in a snow storm and the all wheel drive is excellent | The command center is filled with everything you can imagine | Jukebox Ipod integration satellite radio CD | Rides out great | Very luxurious interior and the 3 | 5 really moves when you need to | I have only put about 6k on the car so far but love it | As soon as my wife's lease is up on her car she wants the G37x | 
 "words": The M35 AWD is an electronics powerhouse with an amazing array of safety and convenient features | Unfortunately it suffers from a serious steering problem called tramlining which makes the handling not only unsatisfactory but also dangerous | I replaced tires twice before I learned from a conscientious mechanic of an Infiniti dealership that the problem is with the steering rack which Nissan refuses to replace | Based on this shortcoming I would place a BMW and an Audi ahead of an Infiniti | 
 "words": I test drove a few cars including the new 2009 TL a 2008 E350 and a 2008 528I | The Infiniti held its own against these three fine vehicles both on performance and luxury comparisons | Both the BMW and the Mercedes are excellent vehicles but comparably equipped would have cost me 10k to 15k more | The TL costs slightly less but felt a little smaller and although design tastes are subjective I liked the M's feel much better | 
 "words": Bought car in Oct '08 | So far so good | I'm really impressed with the handling and manual shift combination | It's truly fun to drive | 
 "words": The economy stinks right now and I was able to get a 2008 M35 with about 10000 miles for what I thought was a ridiculously low price | We were looking at Honda CRVs and other mini SUVS loaded | I hate SUVs and convinced my wife that this was the car to buy and now she loves it | The driving experience is almost as good as the BMW 745 and it has a ton of features | I recommend the base model because the sport model has a really stiff ride | It has a nice isolated yet sporty feel | For the money I don't think you can beat it | Against its competitive set it is a good value and a great car but at the prices you can get now it is probably unbeatable | 
 "words": We bought the M35x in October which means it was almost last years car | Problem was tramlining or the movement of the car over uneven pavement | Ever drive on a highway that's been used by a lot of trucks | This car will jump all over the place | I researched and got the tires replaced with Michelins by dealer | Tramlining decreased by about 75 | Yes this car eats gas | My 04 Murano with same VQ35 engine gets a lot better mileage | A lot more comfortable than our 2003 Mercedes C320 and hopefully a lot more reliable | I didn't want AWD but in NJ all that's available is AWD | Too bad | 
 "words": My M35 has been a pleasant car | As someone going for more of a relaxed ride the M35 was nice but I wish it would be a just a bit more soft | Then again this is a sports car and performs like one too | The interior is beautiful the navigation is nice and the rear seat room is actually quite good | HOWEVER this car is a gas machine | If you want a fuel efficient car look toward buying maybe a GS | I've gotten a combination of 18 mpg which was expected but disappointed because it's only a V6 | 
 "words": M35x drives real nice | Sporty and firm ride with no body roll | Plenty of amenities with navigation system | This is a sporty car with a growl and not a smooth and quiet ride | 
 "words": We purchased the M35 since it was such a great value at the time compared to the Mercedes E350 we almost bought | The M35 feels solid with predictable handling and the optional technology and advanced technology packages round out the car well | While not as quiet and smooth as the E350 it's a solid car with respectable performance and comfort | Reliability likely won't be a concern with a standard 60K mile warranty | Wind noise is somewhat noticeable at highway speeds gas mileage a bit disappointing and the performance tires transmit some road noise into the cabin | But for the deals that Infiniti is offering right now it was simply a no-brainer | A fine car and a no-regrets purchase | 
 "words": Purchased the M35 with the technology package in July 08 | For the most part it is a lovely car but it seems like it is missing some comfort items | It swallows gasoline instead sipping on it | The ride is nice and quiet and it has PLENTY of room inside and a ton of style outside | 
 "words": Just purchased an M35 with the Tech and Sport package and I love the car | It is a perfect combination of sport and comfort | My previous two cars were an 04 Acura TL and 01 BMW 530i | I considered the Lexus GS and BMW 528i | The Lexus was not sporty enough and the BMW was not as good a value | With the Tech and Sport package this car has all the goodies I wanted at a great price | This is a car my whole family likes | Plenty room in the back for my thirteen year old daughter and her friends | All the technology a thirteen would want | My wife enjoys the heated and cooled seats Texas as well as the navigation bluetooth sat radio and iPod connection and we all like being seen in it | 
 "words": This car is almost perfect if you want a more sporty ride | The suspension gearing and exhaust all are more sport oriented than the Lexus type comfort some may anticipate | The steering is the only non-sporty aspect of the M35 | It is overly sensitive and loose at center | Constant correction is required at highway speed | The V6 leaves you wanting at times but that is why they offer a V8 | The car needs more gears | The new FX 7 speed transmission should fix this | The M35 cost less than some of its competitors but I think it lacks a few features if you look closely | Infiniti is learning and will pull it all together with the next iteration | 
 "words": I usually lease an SUV to carry equipment for my company | My last was an Escalade ESV | But now I don't carry much anymore so I wanted a car and much lower monthly payments | I drove the Mercedes E350 BMW 5 series Audi A6 Cadillac STS DTS and Lexus forget the model but was the same size | I want the latest features | I was used to the backup camera | I think it is a safety feature and I will not buy a car without it | I want navigation and satellite radio | I want rear side etc air bags | I want electric mirrors electric cool heated seats | I want a quiet and not-underpowered car | I do not want to spend 1 cent on fluff sport packages chrome wheels etc I am over 40 | 
 "words": I switched out of my E Class Mercedes after years of electrical problems into one of the best cars I've ever owned | The quality of the car is unsurpassed the dash beautiful and the seating absolutely comfortable | My Mercedes was anything but reliable with numerous problems and never dealers never able to fix them on the first second or maybe the third try | On the other hand the Infiniti M35x is perfect | There's room for five and large trunk and a great sound system | My only complaint is the awful gas mileage | In the city it averages a bit over 14 and on the road barely 21 | With today's gas prices I don't care who you are that kind of mileage is unacceptable | 
 "words": All around a nice vehicle | A bit pricey compared to other models but better than BMW | Very nice ride and a lot of fun to drive quiet at highway speeds but it could have a little better mileage | Very nice electronics package | Could face very stiff competition from the new Lincoln MKS mileage-wise and price wise | But all around a very nice vehicle and fun to drive | A 9 out of 10 | 
 "words": Bought M35S and am very pleased | This car is exciting to drive and turns heads | HVAC is top notch cools down quickly even in MS | Road noise is barely noticeable | Seats are supportive comfortable and cooled | Great touch | Would buy another one immediately if stolen | XM iPod make the car very enjoyable on trips | If you want a classy sports car this is it | Own a 2007 FX-35 too and will remain brand loyal | 
 "words": I find the M35 to be at the top of the list in this class | The build quality is outstanding and the ride non-sport is very comfortable | Reports have indicated that road noise at speed is more than it should be | I think most cars with sport tires and wheels of this design will transmit a bit more noise to the cabin at speed | It isn't enough to even be concerned with unless you are an absolute freak about total silence | The exterior design is eye catching and the interior is by far the most impressive I have seen in any car | The drop in Lexus reliability and the unsubstantiated excessive cost of the BMW took those two off my list early | A great car and a real value | 
 "words": My husband and I bought a new M35 in February | On May 10 we were in a series accident with a 1999 truck the car and truck was totalled | A very bad accident that could have taken my husband's life with the truck hitting in the driver's door but because of the excellent safety features of the car especially the curtain airbags our lives were spared | I only had the car for 3 months but it was a great car and I loved it and will probably buy another one when I'm able to drive again | 
 "words": Had an 06 M35 Sport got this M35x when lease expired | Have had 2 J30s an early Q45 and now second M35 | All I have ever done is put in oil and follow maintenance schedule reliability could not be better | I looked at A6 Acura RL MB C and E class and BMW 5 | Previously have owned Audi Acura BMW but enjoy the M35 the most | The ride is so much more comfortable in the 35x than the Sport and quieter too | Yet it is plenty firm with good road feel | Very fun to drive | 
 "words": Very pleased with the M | The only complaint would be fuel mileage | The M35 is lower than several others in this class | 
 "words": I used to own the Q45 and switched for all wheel drive Ausi A8 | After 8 years of German cars I am back | This car is really well thought out and is quality throughout | It rides great although i might have preferred the 8 cylinder M45 | It has plenty of get up and go so maybe i will get used to it | Everything else about the car from the handling comfort appearance and space is fantastic | I am a big guy 6'3 and I have plenty of room for me and the person sitting behind me | The stereo is very good and it doesn't matter what your source of music is the car can handle it | I looked at the Acura RL Lexus GS and the Audi A6 | M35x was the clear winner | 
 "words": I had the 2006 model and just purchased the 2008 model with the sport package | This car is far better than any of its competitors and comes with an abundance of standard features | The ride is sporty yet comfortable | The interior is well appointed and well thought out | The navigation system is by far the best and most sophisticated one out there yet its very easy to use | You can talk to it via voice commands while driving most competitors force you to type in directions while in park | Buy one you wont regret it | 
 "words": I traded me FX35 with sport package in for M35 with Tech Sport | M35 drives similarly to FX35 which was fun to drive but a little quieter | Test drove GS LS A6 A8 XJ XF and found the M to be a good mix between comfort and fun | But Lexus is a step ahead in term of technology | Interior design is what sold me on the car | A6 A8 are too confusing GS LS are too boring XF is as good if not better but less room in the back | 
 "words": I traded in my 2006 M35 for a 2008 M35s after 34 months because I was very happy with the first M35 and after looking at other cars in its class believe that the current Infiniti pricing and financing deals make the choice for me | 
 "words": It's the perfect car for me | I considered Cadillac CTS Acura TL Lexus ES even the G35x but the M35x had them beat with styling features and yes value for the money | As a music lover I can't say enough about the integrated iPod hookup hard drive flash drive and XM radio | I'm sure there are audiophiles out there who will complain about the Bose stereo but believe me it's fine | You'll hear better worse depending on whatever other car you're interested in | Controls are easy to use | comfortable seats heated cooled | nav w backup camera is dandy | Bluetooth voice activation is intuitive | and of course it looks fantastic both inside out | Drive it and see for yourself | 
 "words": Excellent overall sedan with great electronics fully integrated with one another and easy to use for the driver | 
 "words": An absolutely great car from top to bottom | I drove EVERYTHING in this class | Nothing comes close | Yes HP is down a little but other pluses totally outweigh that | Interior is very comfortable | Exterior is sportier than '07 | Ride is exceptional | 
 "words": I drive on highways a lot and need an easy to use tech interface and this is excellent | Easy to use intuitive and activated through voice commands touch screen and toggle switch | Quieter than I thought it would be and very comfortable and responsive | Great car | 
 "words": The 2008 Infiniti is far superior to the 07 model inasmuch as the exterior has had a much needed facelift revised front and rear fascia grille rear fender panels rear deck lid and taillight design new chrome accents and 18-inch sport wheels | I passed on the 2007 model last year when car shopping for a friend but bought it for myself this year | The interior is roomy and all controls are within easy reach | The view from the cockpit is good and the hood doesn't disappear from view as with the Acura | Good all-around handling for the money led me to choosing the M35 over BMW Acura Lexus and Mercedes I tested them all | 
 "words": I looked at BMW Audi Lexus and Mercedes in addition to Infiniti | The M35 with Sport pkg Tech pkg and advanced Tech Pkg came in near or below the base price of most of the others | The Navi system is among the more intuitive I've ever used and the 14 spkr Bose 5 | 1 system is wonderful | The 19 inch wheels and Z rated tires take corners most cars would balk at without even chirping the rubber | The engine is great in most torque ranges but could use a few more horses from a starting stop | The G37 engine has more power than even the M45's V8 which makes no sense at all to me | I've only had the car for a month but so far I am pleased with the purchase | It's a lot of fun to drive |
