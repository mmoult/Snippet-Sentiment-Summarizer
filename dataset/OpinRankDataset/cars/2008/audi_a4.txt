 "words": Purchased this as a cert pre owned for a great price | Had only 10000 miles on it and jumped on it | Very enjoyable to drive and love the comfort of the seats | Was looking at G35 also but for the money the Audi I thought was a better car | 
 "words": This is my first Audi | I was driving a 6 cyl | VW Passat before this and had never owned a 4 cyl | car so I was a little nervous about getting the 2 | 0T | I am pleasantly surprised with this motor | Although there is a little lag pulling out into traffic now and then I can't complain | Fit and finish are superb and I love the way it looks | I leased in July 2008 so I can't wait to see what 2011 has to offer |

 "words": I bought this car about 5 months ago and it's awesome | The only things I don't like about it are the cup holders under the arm rest and the slight lag out the gate | The lag is random | It's weird but it depends on the day | The engine is definitely affected by extreme temperatures | 
 "words": We looked high and low to find an A4 equipped with the 3 | 2 six and the manual gearbox | We decided to factory order one and discovered that production had already halted to make room for the '09 B8 model | That one wasn't available with the six-speed manual so it looked like the less intersting 328Xi was going to get the nod when the dealer found a car equipped like we wanted basicly equipped with everything in Riverside California | I was going to be there on business and I arrainged to pick the car up there and my wife it's her car drove it back to Tulsa | She and I love the car | From the GPS nav to the smooth shifting six- speed it's a sedan that puts a smile on your face | 
 "words": This car looks great and drives even better | It has comfortable seats and the engine runs very smoothly | The A4 convertible is a cross between a sports car and a luxury car and it clearly has good features of both | While there is always room for improvement I am very pleased with how it handles and the multitude of features | 
 "words": My 2008 Audi A4 Quattro burns oil at a rate of 1 quart per 1000 miles | The oil level warning came on at 6000 10000 and 14000 miles | Each time I had it checked at the dealer where it was purchased and was told each time that no leaks were found and that it was operating normally | They also measured the aforementioned burn off rate according Audi guidelines and informed me that it was well within Audi specifications and no action is required | These engines are problematic and Audi knows it | 
 "words": Really pleased with my lease of this car after one year | Only one issue with a brake light sensor after 1 year of ownership and the dealer fixed it right away | Highway mileage is fantastic but pure city driving gives poorer than I hoped | But overall power and handling are the best | This is the funnest car I've ever driven | Trunk space the best of all convertibles I tested | 
 "words": I started out gunning for a Saturn VUE | But it does not come with a moon roof so I tried on the Audi A4 quatro for size performance finish | It does not disappoint | My first reaction to driving it A little noisy | Initially reminded me of a diesel albeit a fairly quiet one | The noise level is most noticeable when first accelerating | Once under way the noise level recedes and is forgotten | Finish performance wins raves | Safety features brakes road stability guages placement underscore diligent design engineering | This car gives you the feeling it was designed by engineers who like driving cars | Cars that envelope you in comfort | safety | Road stability is totally reassuring | 
 "words":  I am an america living in Germany and have really been able to push this car to its limits | For a four cylinder this car moves There is a significant lag in the turbo when not in the S setting S-lines At 140 miles an hour for 40 miles I averaged about 19 MPG and same road at 70MPH 33 | 6 MPG | 
 "words": I bought this car in brilliant black with black leather interior after researching and test driving cars from the famous five BMW 1 and 3 series Infinity G37 Lexus IS Acura TL | In terms of exterior looks and interior quality and design Audi beats all the others hand down | I have always had a soft corner for Audi when compared to BMW a personality trait of always siding with the underdogs | This car has however met and exceeded my expectations in nearly every department | It drives and handles like a charm in all driving conditions | There are however a few issues that I had hoped would be resolved in the 2009 model but they remain largely unaddressed | They are discussed below
 "words": This is my first car in 15 years live in NYC | I have the manual A4 titanium iPod Bluetooth | The car has been a blast to drive although 4th sounds like it should be 6th | The car moves perfectly and the finish is just as every review indicated nothing I would change about the interior | I have been averaging about 27mpg the first month not bad considering Manhattan traffic | I am really glad I bought the 2008 as the 2009 looks far too much like a BMW | As for reviews about it being a bit slow out the gate I'm not seeing it and am sure it is not worth the MPG trade off to have purchased the larger engine | 
 "words": This is my 3rd A4 Avant 1999 | 2003 | 2008 | I recently had to retire my 1995 Alfa 164LS | I purchased this to drive along with our 2003 A4 Avant | The plan is to retire the 2003 and keep the 2008 once Alfa returns to the USA | The car is quite sporty in nature | It appears as if the new A4 will have more driver right leg room but it is unclear whether the new Avant will be offered as a 6 speed | We only have had manual transmissions with sport suspension | The 2008 2 | 0 engine is more throaty and powerful than previous models | The four wheel drive sticks like glue | The 2 | 0 torque is limited but the acceleration is fine with little turbo lag | Forget BMW and go for it | 
 "words": My other vehicles are 911 turbo Mustang GT convertible Cayenne S | This vehicle has become my favorite | I can drive it over highway 17 in California with vigor | I drove it to Tahoe with the family a roof box and a lot of gear | It was a blast | It compensated well on icy patches and blasted through the snow | I can put my golden retriever in the back pick up the family and still enjoy the ride | The S mode and paddle shifters make this a stealth sports car | I enjoy the S suspension features and the mileage of the 2 | 0T | It feels like a Porsche station wagon | I predict that these wagons will see a resurgence in the near future | The Avant gets 22 around town and 28 highway | 
 "words": Our experience with the A4 has been great my wife loves it | Very economical with gas | As the first time owning an Audi I was not totally sold the first time I drove the car | I immediately noticed the jerk as if I was driving a stick shift vehicle I was told it was the SVT in the vehicles transmission | I only different from our Acura TL and former Lexus model was the oil light came on at 4K miles because shortness of oil | The car ate the oil as if it were candy | Audi told us the vehicle does that within the first couple of 1000's miles | Very small car with great fuel economy joined with a sexy exterior look | 
 "words": The Audi A4 a compact car with plenty of room for the front seat users | It is not intended for 5 passengers | The 2 | 0 liter is very strong for a 4 cylinder so you need to keep in mind it can't be compared to a 6 | Interior is very well built | Exterior is very sharp | This car has all the power anyone should need | If you ease up on the pedal it will get very good gas mileage as I have experienced 29 miles per gallon so far | You can get a larger car if you pay 15 to 20 grand more or you can wait for the 2009 model that will be larger | This car compares to all its competitors and is better in some ways than 328Ix C class G35X | 
 "words": I have had this car for two weeks now and so far I am very pleased with the performance | I love the way car handles yet maintains a decent fuel economy | It makes me go look for some curvy roads | Strongly suggest this car if you enjoy the driving | 
 "words": Have had this for just over 2 weeks and 800 miles and so far I'm very pleased | I do wish the 2 | 0T had more power but I knew going into it that it was a trade-off for better fuel economy | Setting aside the lack of power at the low end I love the way the car drives and handles | Been in one early spring snowstorm so far and it held the road beautifully | Quartz Gray color is stunning | 
 "words": The car is just gorgeous and a blast to drive | Went for the throaty 3 | 2 over the 2 | 0 and I'm glad I did | Not only for the engine but also for the equipment that's standard instead of optional | It's fast and handles like a dream | I actually want more snow | 
 "words": Had the car for 5 weeks and loved every minute | Hit 2115 miles oil pressure light came on and car died | Threw a cam needs entire engine rebuilt possibly major design flaw with 08's | 4 weeks for repairs so far and I still don't have it back | I'm trying to get Audi to get me into a brand new replacement vehicle but they aren't budging they just want to fix it | I didn't pay a premium for a rebuilt car | So much for Audi quality
 "words": My first Audi drove a 1 | 8T jetta for 5 years | this is one sweet ride | Gone is the turbo lag I had in Jetta probably due to the Audi manual transmission | Nice smooth shifting very good acceleration fuel mileage has been in upper 20s but car only has 2000 miles on it | The appearance of the grille is very sporty and somewhat mean looking | I got basic car with 17 wheels leather bluetooth and iPod | The interior is beautiful and very comfortable | The ride is smooth and does this car love curves | Overall the cost of this car is very reasonable | Overall very pleased at this point | Highly recommend anyone taking a look | 
 "words": I have an '04 Jetta and i'm completely unhappy with it probably because I have owned volvos before | I have had this car for about 4 days now and when I get into the car I feel like I am in the Jetta | The console is still small with the small cup holders underneath the ignition jingle never stops until both the driver and passenger have thier sealt belts on and just all the little things about the Jetta are in A4 that would make you skeptical to pay 41000 for it | The turbo charger has a delay when u push on the accelerator | I do have to say though that the seats are comfortable and the styling outside is excellent | 
 "words": It's indeed a dream car | The design is excellent top execution and materials | Everything is balanced with very good taste | The danger in this price range is sending the message that you bought the car to show-off | On the contrary A4 shows that you have a fine taste of spending your money let's admit it it's not a cheap car and everybody sees that | The 2 | 0T has only 200HP but is really powerfull provided that you now how to drive a 4 cyl Turbo engine i | e | buy a manual transmission and do not ask the engine for maximum thrust at 1500rpm | Downshift step on the gas and see what a Turbo engine can do | For me A4 is the ideal compromise between price aspect and driving experience | 
 "words": There are not enough superlatives to accurately describe this car | Fit and finish are fantastic | It offers superior comfort I'm 6'5 handles like a champ provides surprising power from its strong 2 | 0 turbo and provides over 30 highway MPG | This is a very special automobile | 
 "words": This is my third Audi and by far my favorite | I enjoy the throatiness of the turbo and think that the new 2 | 0 is one of the ten best engines in the world | I confess to dropping quattro this time both to improve fuel economy and to free up enough to spring for the S-Line | Sure all new 2008 sedans have S-line styling on the body but not the 18 wheels sport suspension and superb interior trim | My advice is to spring for it as you hardly ever see the 18 wheels on A4 and it enhances the look tremendously | I am delighted too with the granite gray color which shifts with the changing light and weather | always a pleasure to come across it anew | 
 "words": We have only had the car for a month but we are loving it so far | The ride is very comfortable and quiet yet the vehicle holds the road extremely well | The styling of the car is beautiful inside and out | 
 "words": I've looked at everything BMW Acura MB Lexus etc finally settled on the Audi and haven't regretted it since | The car is a pleasure to drive and it's obvious that someone put some thought into building this monster | Fun to drive beautiful inside and out can't get enough | I didn't go with any of the extra options they're a bit pricey and don't really add much to the experience | I think you can figure out when to turn on the lights and wipers | 
 "words": I've only had it for 3 days but I love it so far | Good performance for the engine size and handles great | I was torn between getting a pure sports car or pure luxury car but the A4 has enough of both to please me | The Sport setting on the auto transmission is great for playing around but sucks the gas too much for day to day driving | I also can't wait for some snow to test the AWD out | 
 "words": Just picked up a new 08 A4 2 | 0T Quattro with Sport Suspension | Previously drove an 06 A4 CVT front wheel drive | After driving the front wheel drive Audi for 2 years and really liking the way it handled I was amazed with the Quattro's road handling prowess | On the way home from the dealer I was on the freeway and naturally fiddling with the stereo adjustments and didn't notice that I was approaching a sharp curve to the left while making a transition from one highway to another | I entered the corner at about 65 40 advised and started to go for the brake but as I turned the wheel the car simply took the corner like it was on a rail | I kid you not | 
 "words": Looked for a wagon not SUV with some style and performance settled on the A4 with 6-spd and am extremely happy so far | This car is as fun to drive as my 325i and much more than my CLK430 and can carry stuff to boot | I have had no reliability issues after 3 weeks | I know this isn't the final word but no horror stories | So far I get about 25 mpg around town suburbs not city and more like 29 hwy a little less if I feel like having fun | It is not really a lightweight car so this seems acceptable | Interior is very quiet and comfortable my first 5-hour road trip flew by | Can't wait to see what quattro can do in the snow | 
 "words": I just picked up my new Audi A4 quattro 2 | 0T and can't get over this car | I've only had it a week but I've been entirely impressed thus far | The feel and ride are just great solid and smooth | Handling is sure and secure | I owned a 2001 VW Jetta GLX previously and was a little unsure of going back to a four cylinder but the power of the 2 | 0T feels even better than the V6 in the Jetta | I was also concerned about engine noise and gas mileage | The growl of the Audi exhaust makes me smile and I'm getting about the same in mileage as I was in the Jetta made the switch back to a 4 cylinder worth it | I got the Audi loaded up with extras | 
 "words": The car can be summed up in one phrase performance and luxury in a compact design | I drove a 2003 and 2005 3 | 0L A4 prior to getting this one and the performance stands up well | There is definitely noticeable turbo lag but this can probably be overcome by changing driving habits | The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit throatier than I'm used to | The car handles extremely well though hugging curves and accelerating very smoothly | The now-standard S-Line exterior features definitely give the car a sportier look | The interior is outstanding | The layout is getting better and the list of available features is exhaustive | In all a great car |
