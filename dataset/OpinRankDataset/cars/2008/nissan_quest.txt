REVIEWS
 "words": My Quest is Awesome | It gets great gas mileage that ranges between 27-30 MPG on the highway | Tons of space | Phenomenal acceleration | Maximum performance is obtained by using 5W-30 Valvoline SynPower Oil or Castrol Edge Synthetic Oil | Have not had any problems with it at all | Absolutely the best Mini-Van option on the Market | I got a great deal that Ford Toyota nor Honda could match | The fold down rear seating options come in handy for moving days or hauling delicate items | Would buy again it opportunity arises | Great amount of features for base model | This van gots it all | 
 "words": Lots of space | Got a good deal on it so it was a great value | Drives very much like a big car | Good power and pretty decent gas mileage 18 city 24 to 25 highway | Agree with others that the body structure is a little loose | 
 "words": I traded in my 2000 Quest SE which we loved dearly | I thought it would be hard to see it go but na I don't look back anymore because this performance and ride surpasses the old | Our 2000 model was fully loaded but this is definitely a upgrade | This is our 3rd car and it is hard to stay out of it | I got a unbeatable deal which made it very affordable which Honda didn't offer | For the options I have in the Quest SE the only honda model that could compare is the Touring but the price was ridiculously much higher | Nissan Delivers | 
 "words": We needed larger transportation so we checked out Honda Toyota and Nissan | The Nissan had what we needed and at the right price | We drove 300 miles to the shore the next week and got 29 | 6 mpg all highway with cruse control | Mixed driving is 21 mpg | Love the tinted glass on the base model | It carries everything you need to take the family on vacation | It is also great for getting on the highway very good acceleration | 
 "words": This car is excellent when it is new | VERY new | Because at 4 months it is old yet | the interior sounds like if the car was 10 years old | Wind rattle vibrations | Customer support overlooks my problems with arrogance | Nothing abnormal they say | 
 "words": I have owned my 08 Nissan Quest for 5 months now and have put on 4800 miles | I have had it in the dealer one time and that was for the first oil change at 3000 miles | The van is beautiful to look at I love the auto hatch door | It is very convenient to have it open and close with the touch of a button | Also the dual sliding doors both work and I don't notice any rattling | The fold flat rear seats are quick and easy to manipulate and came in handy when I was moving some furniture | My gas mileage is great not as good as my Odyssey with the VCS engine though | I am averaging 24MPG using 87 Regular gas | I have flat terrain and avoid highways | I recommend | 
 "words": My wife and I have owned an Altima Pathfinder two Maximas and three Quests 2004 2007 2008 all SEs | Our first Quest was great mechanically except for the sliding door rattles that Nissan fixed the next year | We found the road noise to be quieter after replacing the Good Year tires with Bridgestone | 2007 had front end issues fixed under warranty no door rattles but we got hoodwinked by the Michelin PAX tires so we just traded for the 2008 | I think it will be quieter again after removing the Good Year Eagle tires | I have had Eagles on other vehicles without the road noise but not the Quest | We have loved all of our Nissan's | They have rarely if ever had to visit mechanics | 
 "words": My SE Quest includes dual DVD screen navigation system | The main reason for purchasing the Quest because all my family members like the style interior designs of the van even though I am not very confident of the long-term reliability of the Quest | However I was willing to make the bet | It is no question that the Quest has much better exterior and interior designs comparing with other major vans Odyssey Sienna etc | The only thing I did not like is the uncomfortable front seats | But the van is much quieter than Sienna or Odyssey | 
 "words": We looked at all minivans before looking at the quest it was our final stop | I test drove it and loved it | It does drive like a car and is very comfortable | I love the room inside | The seats are very comfortable | I am getting the average minivan gas mileage so i cant complain about that | I would recommend this van to anyone and for what you get for the price compared to odyssey and sienna its a great deal | I also love that all the seats can fold flat without having to be taken out of the vehicle | 
 "words": With a large family of 4 children we are forced to drive a mini-van | I've owned 2 prior mini-vans in the past always felt like I was driving a mini-van | With the Quest not only does it not look like your average mini-van but you feel like you're driving a luxurious car not some soccer mom vehicle even though that's what it is | The interior is amazing my husband I actually argue on who's going to drive it where as before I could have cared less | I love this van would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the market for a new mini-van w a large family | 
 "words": This is our 1st mini-van and we had our eyes set on Odyssey and Sienna | After testing driving them all Quest twice we decided on the Quest due to the incentive and designs | It drives and looks like a wagon but is roomy as a minivan | The other cars especially the Sienna are very boring but Quest still looks fresh after 4 years since 2004 | The fuel economy is awesome for a 4000 lbs vehicle | I could easily get 26 MPG on the highway | Doesn't feel like driving a mini-van at all | 
 "words": I have only owned it for a month but I can say it has great power for a minivan | I can get 25 mpg Highway when trying | Have maxed out at 26 | 4 I have fun with the MPG display gauge and Tire PSI which i set at 44 PSI | Automatic hatch is great but the cubby hole where the 3rd row can fold into is great for food shopping | I feel for the money its a good van | 
 "words": We my wife and I cannot be more happy | I love the acceleration space comfort sound and the feel driving this car | 
 "words": We purchased the Quest about 2 months ago and to my surprise have had no real issues | This is our first minivan and I was leaning hard to the Sienna simply because I have owned Toyotas in the past and have had no major problems | After much research we went with the Quest because of the incentives offered at the time | We got much more van at a lower cost than the Sienna | Happy so far but only time will tell | 
 "words": We have owned 3 previous minivans and have been pleased with all 3 for there everyday and vacation utility to haul 4 children a bunch of luggage and still not break your back at the gas pump | When we started out this time we set ourselves on the Odyssey EXL w DVD or Toyota Sienna XLE | These are suppose to be the champs | We loved the Honda versus our prior Chrysler TCs for the style and build | We favored the Honda over the Sienna's styling we were buying the Honda | I decided after further research to look at the redesigned Quest 3 | 5 SE | We were instantly impressed by this luxury sport vans handling | This blows away the concept that minivans have to be boring unimaginative people movers
 "words": This is our 3rd Nissan Quest previously had a 1994 2004 and now the 2008 | I love this van I am 5'9 my husband is 6'3 my sons are 6'6 and 6'8 and I have two young daughter's as well | Would you believe there is room left over | We are going camping next month and we will definitely have a better time with all the space | The look and feel of the car is beautiful the sound system is awesome | 
 "words": Just bought the '08 Quest | Car drives excellent and has a lot of room for my child his stuff my huge dog and all of his frisbees and all of our show equipment | I traded in an '01 Sentra that was exclusively maintained at the dealership and ran trouble free for us till we decided on a bigger vehicle | The van is very nimble and drives more like a car | Did consider the sienna and the odyssey but the quest simply drove better and felt better | It was also cheaper by several thousands | 
 "words": I went from driving a 5 speed Turbo VW Passat to this Quest | Overall I'm happy with it but I do miss driving a sports sedan | We considered the Odyssey Quest and Sienna | The Quest was the best value that particular month and we've had 4 great Nissans before | The acceleration steering and braking are great | Tons of power regardless of its size | Very comfortable to drive | The interior is great and I think the exterior offers the best styling in the minivan category | The cabin is a bit too noisy | I think it's weird to have only one power sliding door | I love being able to make all the seats flat wihtout having to remove any | 
 "words": I purchased a used 2008 with 500 miles | At the time I wondered why anyone would trade this vehicle with under 500 miles but was taken with the style and the lay down 2 row seats | Long story short after my first long ride over 100 miles I took the van back to the deal complaining of hard ride that left my kidneys aching for two days | After some counseling we exchanged tires used nitrogen reduced tire pressure tried every seating position with electronic seat and manual lumbar adjustment during the next week all to some relief but still could not get comfortable | Talked to managers other salespersons all to no avail | tried leather seat vs cloth no
 "words": We have 6 grandkids so Mamaw decided she wanted a new minivan | We got the Quest | I love the features the ease of operating the features particularly the electric sliding door and power liftgate | The front and rear air is a real blessing and I love the fact the antenna is in the rear glass | I wish satellite radio had been included instead of an add on | The only thing is the trip feature says we are only getting about 19 | 3 per gallon at the moment | I hope it's lying | This is the only thing I would not like about this van | I would buy another in a heartbeat | 
 "words": We just bought a 2008 Quest after looking and driving other makeHonda toyota but in my own opinion this is the best among them in terms of performance comfort finish quality and value | This van runs like my E 350 MB very smooth and responsive and more features for your money | Reliability and dependabilty I like nissan this is our fifth nissan car | 
 "words": The Quest is a fun to drive take everyone and everything van with multiple seating arrangements without removing a single seat or head rest | The ride is smooth and effortless but still fun to drive | Still getting used to the navigation system but the 3-D view that it offers is great | We gladly would recommend the Quest to anyone considering buying a minivan | 
 "words": Great car | Been debating b w odyssey sienna crossovers | Very happy with quest | Wasn't thrilled with a minivan but this is acceptable | Coming from an Audi so quality and road noise are not as nice but the amount of room is great | Kids love the van | 
 "words": We used to drive a 1993 Nissan Quest and just over a year ago we finally sold it | We replaced it with a 2000 Dodge Caravan | Probably my most regrettable choice ever | We just purchased a new Quest 3 | 5 S and couldn't be more thrilled | I wouldn't even look at another brand of minivan and will replace this one in many years with another Quest | The interior design is so comfortable for my family of 6 | The exterior is very stylish | We love it | 
 "words": I have only had this car for less than a month but have been driving a mini-van for the past twelve years | This is by far the most drivable mini-van I have ever owned | It handles like a car | The Bluetooth is a wonderful plus | The only thing I feel I have to get used to is the body style is longer and wider than the last two Chryslers I have had | It makes parking a little more challenging for me | 
 "words": We just bought our Quest SE model after months of looking at the other minivans including the new chrysler and looking at the GM crossover vehicles Acadia and Outlook | You just can't beat the interior volume in the Quest and the beautifully finished interior | The Mazda CX9 interior may be the best in the crossover market but in our opinion the Quest is a close second | The Sienna interior is a bit long in the tooth and the Odyssey is nice but doesn't have the skylights or the factory trailering option which is key for us because of our hitch mounted bike trailer and cargo carrier | The other minivan hitches significantly reduce ground clearance |
