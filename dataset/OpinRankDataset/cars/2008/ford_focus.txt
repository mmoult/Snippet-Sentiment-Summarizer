REVIEWS
 "words": I am very happy with the purchase of my 2008 Focus SES except for 1 thing | It came with the Moon and Tune Package | But the treble on the radio fades in and out constantly | A mechanic rode with me and told me it's because my Sirius-capable radio is being interrupted by all the towers in the area and the only possible fix would be to renew my subscription | It drives me crazy | Does anyone else have this problem | Not sure I agree with him | 
 "words": I bought the car new | At 33000 miles I have replaced the tires had several minor problems fixed and as of today I have my third transmission | After the repairs and frequent tows I have contacted Ford | But instead of helping they congratulated me on buying the extended warranty | I have always owned Ford products but after today and Ford's response to my lemon I will not own another Ford once I can get rid of this one |

 "words": I love this car but it is chewing up the tires | At 30000 miles I put on a new set of tires | Now 12000 miles later it appears I need to replace more tires | I have them rotated at every oil change | But I can now see obvious wear and it appears that the car is out of alignment since it has a wicked shake at around 65 mph | Car is great but it is eating up the tires |

 "words": I owned a 2001 Ford Focus ZX4 and was so impressed I bought another one | The 01 handled like a slot-car while the 08 handles more like a rear wheel sports' car | The gas mileage in the 08 is quite a bit better than the 01 | The fit and finish on both cars were good | Very impressed with SYNC | We have 2 cell phones and SYNC seamlessly works with both | The only thing I would change is the inside door handles on the coupe which is in an awkward spot | Forget iPods I have all my tunes in a thumb-drive and I can tell SYNC what to play how cool is that |

 "words": Biggest mistake I ever made was buying a Ford Focus | Its used up 17 tires in 80000 km | 3 of the tires were legit due to nails found | But the remaining were due to bad alignment crappy suspension and dust dirt in rims | I will never buy a Ford product again | Also the amount of dust that gets through the stripping around the doors is insane | My car is always filthy but I was told thats just a Ford Focus its how they're made | Its fun to drive and good on gas but its the biggest mistake I have ever purchased |

 "words": I live in Calif so this car is almost polution free with the PZEV system grilling a burger produces more Hydro Carbons than a 100 mile trip it may cut into the MPG but I am getting 31 combined in the LA area and 36 on a recent road trip along the california coast with varing speeds and hills and with stops in towns on the way | So I am really pleased with this fun to drive car | My business partner bought a Toyota Yaris as it gets 37-39 but on highway speeds the road noise is terrible and the stearing is by wire so it does not handle near as nice as the focus and is very slow to get up and going compared to the focus 1 | 5 vs | 2 | 0 | for just a couple of mpg I will take the power any day
