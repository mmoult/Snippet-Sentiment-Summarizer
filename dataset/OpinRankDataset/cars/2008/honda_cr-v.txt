 "words": The crv is a top car when you have all the boys toys installed but the downside I have recently experienced on my less than 22months vehicle is that both my front Yokohama 245 45 19 inch tires had to be changed due to the service dept inspecting the tread and recording the tread at the limit of 1 | 6 mm | I find this disappointing given that I have done only 13000 miles from new and no erratic driving | This is too costly |

 "words": We have owned this car for almost a year and are very pleased with it | We shopped for the Rav4 Equinox etc but the CRV came out ahead | On a long trip recently which included a mountain pass we got 33 mpg | It's cute handles well and is great in the snow and on ice | On the down side the tires that come with it are garbage and several people have had to replace them after only one year including us | The folding rear seats are a VERY poor design | They wad up behind the front seats and give you almost no extra room | Honda designers should take some tips from Rav4 rear seats and have them fold once and completely flat | Also the hatchback when opened can drip muddy snow and rain | 
 "words": I am very disappointed with the upholstery on my CR-V | This car is 16 months old and the seats look worse than my 2002 Odyssey | This material does not clean up and shows wear at an unacceptable level | I bought Honda because I expect 10 years before I trade and in this case I may soon be trading- maybe not Honda |
