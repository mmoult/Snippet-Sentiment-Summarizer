REVIEWS
 "words": this car was bought new sight unseenWhat a mistake | Interior has little to no design | If you like plastic you will love the interior because other than the uncomfortable seats it is all plastic | Cup holders are non functional in the standard shift model | The back seats serve no purpose | exterior look is ok but needs some accents | Handling is not very good at higher speeds | Engine has some power but nowhere near as responsive as the older models | 2000 and olderThe best way to describe the ride is to drive a dump truck with concrete wheels | Needless to say the 2008 mustang gt is not a good choice | Try the new chevy camarobetter looks and more speed | 
 "words": Always wanted a muscle car but got married young while my friends were driving Mustangs Road Runners and Corvettes | Now they are driving mini vans while I am cruising in my GT convertible | Started talking to my wife about getting a Mustang since the 05 hit the dealers not really thinking that she would go along with it until one day she said if we get one can it be a convertible it was then that I knew she wanted it as much as I did | I hesitated about the convertible since I never had one and I remember the old rag tops leaking with lots of wind noise | I test drove one and found it to be pleasanty quiet with the interior of the roof very plush hardly looking like a convertible | 
 "words": Purchased this 2008 Bullitt in January 2009 at Ford employee pricing plus 2000 rebate | The exhaust note on this car is incredible- every time I start it I feel like an 8 year old who just stole the keys to the Batmobile | Edmund's review of this car lauds the shifter they weren't kidding- incredibly smooth | Fantastic seats great appearance | Fuel economy is poor in town given the low gearing but I've averaged 25 at steady 75 mph on the highway | 
 "words": My car has the shaker stereo leather etc | I was surprised that the Radial T As it came with stunk got rid of those tires and replaced them with some hot Falkens now it handles GREAT | It is really just a two seater tho don't really know why Ford had to design the rear seat with the back practically straight up but it makes sitting back there a painful experience if more than a couple blocks | The front seats are great and LOTS of leg room | You can see the seams in some of the plastics which detracts from an otherwise well executed interior design | I bought the V6 thinking it would get better mileage I shoulda got the 8 I think it mighta got better mileage | 
 "words": This car does more than expected for the price | The 300 horses give a fun launch from a stop and provide pretty good high speed acceleration | Floor this car at 100mph and in seconds you are at speeds you shouldn't be doing not that you should have been doing 100mph in the first place | But the car performs well at high speed | What really impressed me was the ability to take corners with this car | This car eats turns for breakfast and you would have to spend a lot more money to equal the handling of this car | Now is the car comfortable hitting potholes | No and it wasn't meant to be | So if you want above average power and looks for a fairly low price this is a good choice | 
 "words": The Mustang GT is the musclecar buy of the last 40 years | It goes well stops idles and cruises like a dream | It runs on 87 gas and gives all 300 Horses doing it | The car is when driven responsibly the safest sporting car in the U | S | A | The visibility is excellent the exhaust note is hypnotic | The stock stereo has cheap made in China speakers that sound anywhere from ok to very very poor especially at volume | The a c is iced cold anytime right away | The ergonomics and controls are sheer simplicity | The retro design of the interior with the satin aluminum package is a work of art | The plastics are thick and affixed very well | The surfaces may appear cheap but they are strong | Wow | 
 "words": As a former owner some25 years ago of a v6 mustangII holly crap | It's been 25 years of boring dependable toyota trucks | 6 be be exact | I finaly had to try one | Took my 20yr old son with me for a test drive | been loving it ever since | needles to say it's one car he won't be driving | It's a 2008 left over 4 | 0 premium with pony package | I'm allready having factory cold air induction installed as we speak and will probably go for dual exust | hav'nt had this much fun in a while | Hope it last a lot longer than my75 did | 
 "words": I purchased my 2008 Mustang V6 with Pony Package at the beginning of 2009 and I love it | You can't beat the beautiful styling for the dollar | Pony package adds a performance look with fog lamps and Bullitt wheels | GT handling package really makes cornering a BLAST | Mine also has the optional Shaker 500 audio system which I HIGHLY recommend if you are a music fan | Fuel economy is OK I would have expected better from a V6 but it's not all that bad | The enthusiast in me can't help but want just a little more when I press the gas pedal but this car has PLENTY of pep for most people and it sounds really cool when accelerating | If you want power I suggest paying the extra for a GT | 
 "words": A great car | It is what it is a pony car with gruntstyle and flair | I get positive comments from 10 to 80 year old guys and dolls | My Acura rarely gets attention like the Mustang | 
 "words": My main focus is to drive a car that doesn't make feel bad about the purchase price or the fuel economy | My V8 gives me 24 | 7 MPG combined city highway | I have the power when I need it and the smooth ROAR to brag about it | I didn't pay through the nose like I would have with some other performance cars and the looks are great | It doesn't have the girlie bells and whistles like my wife's car does but I didn't have to pay for them either | It's athletic handsome inexpensive to maintain and it's american made and proud of it | Don't just buy one buy two for the price one foreign made | When you're old and cranky spend your money on a luxury expensive car that only an expensive mechanic can fix
 "words": I imported my 2008 Black Mustang Convertible pony package from US to UAE United Arab Emirates being a sports car lover for years it was my dream come true but from the first day itself I was disappointed as far as comfy quality and power are concerned | I thought Dodge Charger is more refined and comfortable mustang behaved like my 1997 Ford Explorer though I thought Explorer is better in comfortability | But the moment I drop down the top it became totally different species all together | I became the center attraction and it was fun to drive around in neighbor hood with loud music on | Better than my 1999 Camaro Convertible | All complaints are vanished | 
 "words": I just purchased 4523 in 2 09 and I love this car | I have been in the market for a new car for 5 years and I test drove many cars like the 350Z RX8 370Z EVO VIII IX and X all of which are very nice cars and definitly worth considering | The Bullitt is suprisingly comfortable and head space is very generous | At 6'7 this something I need to consider | Ride is firm but not overly stiff | Nothing beats the power and torque curve of a V8 | The other vehicles do not have that brute force authoritative power that the Bullitt has | Also all of the afore mentioned vehicles require 91 octane fuel and the Bullitt does not | Bottom line This car is fun fast and relitively practical | 
 "words": First and last FORD I'll never buy a Ford again | I agree with everything the editor said in his review about the mustang it's a really nice car for the first 5000 miles or so | Check out the TSB service bulletins for the mustang before you buy one | Many problems engine misfire water leaks by the buckets from dashboard auto tranny failurescan't fill gas tankand Ford is the worst at fixing the problems | They give it the sunshine treatment for the expensive problems until your warranty is up | I have replaced the trans a c comp alternator 3-batteries power steering pump and more | 
 "words": Ford got the Bulllitt Mustang right in so many ways I love the low-key retro styling cues throughout | No stripes no fins no flames and very little chrome | Slick shifter engine pulls hard and has a satisfying muscle car exhaust note | I owned an '86 GT and this thing handles like it's from another planet | You can actually throw it around curves without the rear end breaking loose at the slightest tap on the gas | Excellent seats and very comfortable on a couple of 300 mile road trips | I'd like another 200 HP or so as the car does run out of power before I'd like but I couldn't afford the Shelby GT 500 | I rarely get to drive it that hard so it's a mild criticism | 
 "words": As far as comfortably priced and comfortably equip sports muscle cars go this is the best I have ever driven | With leather and an appearance package tacked on to this little V6 you don't need much more | With 210 horsepower I'd argue there was more this V6 will kick any little 4 banger out there to the curb while not quite being dangerously powerful | If your looking for power and style with a reliable name and company look no further | 
 "words": This car is an absolute blast to drive | Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want | I will line up any Toyota Honda Nissan etc | against this baby | For the price it can't be beat | First off the torque is unbelievable | HP is immediately available | No need to wind this baby up | You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear | I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it | Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane | Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat | 
 "words": This car is an absolute blast to drive | Who ever said American car companies don't build cars people want | I will line up any Toyota Honda Nissan etc | against this baby | For the price it can't be beat | First off the torque is unbelievable | HP is immediately available | No need to wind this baby up | You won't want to play the excellent 500 watt Shaker stereo radio as the exhaust note is the best sound you will ever hear | I test drove 20 different cars but when I got in this one I knew I was going to have to purchase it | Very easy to have fun driving around town and you will get 17-24 mpg on 87 octane | Fill the tank with 91 octane and hold onto your seat | 
 "words": If you want a mean sounding torque pounding rumbling V8 with a 5 speed like I did with modern day comfort the Mustang GT is it | Leather seats are comfortable | I installed 3 | 73 gears lowered the car 1 | 5 inches with Ford racing springs and added the FRPP GTA axleback mufflers that come on the Bullitt Mustang | The car is set up the way it should be and with the mods still under 26K | The GT is raw and the ride is a little on the rough side but it's so much fine to drive | Gas mileage for me is around 20 overall | If you want quiet and refined look elsewhere | If you want a solid fun RWD V8 at a great price with unlimited aftermarket support get the GT | No regrets at all | 
 "words": I have owned a few Mustangs and typically leave the exterior plain and spend the time and effort on modifying the engine and suspension | My wife and I both saw a 2008 Bullitt in the Highland Green and were immediately drawn to the car's understated simplicity of styling that made the cars we loved as teenagers such classics | Then I drove one | The changes are subtle from the 2006 GT I have been driving for 3 years but the suspension is firmer and the shifter is more precise | The power difference negligible over the GT but the car just looks and sounds right | If you grew up driving V-8 muscle cars in the 60's and 70's or wanted to and couldn't afford to this is your car | 
 "words": I have the V6 deluxe auto | Its performance does not equal the T-bird but it costs much less | The ride is not as smooth as the Marquis but it's not luxury or as expensive | It handles much better than the diesel F-250 but that's expected | Sometimes the manual adjustment for the chairs gets annoying especially while driving but I guess drivers should adjust everything first | Cruise control is very precise and simple and even thought the media controls aren't mounted on the wheel they are still very close | I control radio etc with my wrist resting on the stick | A bit bumpy but great handling
 "words": Three to four dollar a gallon gas prompted me to look for something besides my 3 4 ton truck to drive | I didn't want to spend more than 20K but still wanted something fun to drive | I seriously looked at the Solitace Miata and Mustang | The Pontiac and Miata were at least 8K more for compariable cars albeit they were rag tops | Ford was offering 5K in rebates bring the price down to 16K drive off | The base Mustang comes with many of the desireables that are option on the other models | I have taken two trips over two hundred miles and and averaged 30-31 mpg on both trips | Combined city hwy driving this week averaged 24 mpg | The car is a blast to drive and looks great | I am very pleased | 
 "words": I love to drive this car | It's my first muscle car after owning 335 horsepower Audi A8 231 horsepower VW Touareg and 400 horsepower BMW 7 series and I have to say that I'm really impressed | I knew not to expect much from the interior comparing to the German cars I've owned but I never expected the car to be so fun so fast and so | drivable | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 mustang V-6 base model in Vapor silver | The car looks great is quite comfortable is well equiped and performs very well for a v-6 5speed | I have had BMWs A Corvette C-6 and some other great cars and this little Mustang measures up against them quite well | Very nice car for the money | 
 "words": I am 19 years old and own my dream car | Evertime I look at it in the parking lot I think what a cool car then realize it's mine | Magazines complain about the handling but the stock tires are rock hard since Ford expects people to actually drive the car unlike other manufacturers this means they last longer | For the price you simply can't beat the performance you get back in return | As far as the interior I think the design is brilliant and very clean looking but most peoples complaints are the materials being on the harder side | Even though Ford sells 130K of these a year people still smile and wave when you drive by | 
 "words": I love this car | I have the 5 speed automatic and it performs without trouble | Sure the gas mileage isn't that great but really who would expect that from a muscle car | The only trouble is the really noisy top latches | The rattle like crazy with the top up | At first no rattles but as the weeks went by the latches were rattling like crazy | Ford replaced them and they were fine for a while now they are rattling again | 
 "words": The Bullitt Package on the 2008 Mustang makes the car a road racing machine right from the factory | The upgrades transform the car into a fun to drive and great looking machine | 
 "words": I've been wanting a Mustang for as long I can remember | I always wanted an older classic one but they have become too expensive | I finally bought one this year and I love it | She rarely gets out since I drive my company truck most often | But when I do take her out on Sundays I'm amazed how nice she drives and how sporty she looks | I wouldn't change my Stang for anything | 
 "words": This is my first Ford I am a GM man | I wanted a sports car convertible made in America | This was my only choice | I don't understand why Ford doesn't make Mustangs stock that is high performance | Yes you can purchase from Saleen Rouch etc with all the goodies why not from Ford at least as options | I added a hurst shifter chrome 20 wheels side stripes things to make it look better | I must admitt I do get a lot of Nice Car comments | Probably because I have over 100 coats of wax on it | Mine is a candy apple red | I do love the sound system I wished they had a hood scoop on my car even though it was a fake | It does look good | I purchased this car off the lot | My Camaro was fast
 "words": I work downtown Los Angeles and park at the country club with all sorts of exotic cars let alone your M6s S8s etc | but the valet guys favor my car | The people from GAS Pimp my ride spruced it up with 20 inch Boss wheels Bassani exhaust cold air in- take computer chip and Eibach lowered suspension | In all I've spent an extra 10k on extras and it was well worth it | This care simply can't sit still and it's made to gun it with a mighty roar | I'd only wish I would have used the 1200 bucks for the stereo and gotten an after-market system | 
 "words": I have been wanting a Mustang since I rented twice on business trips over the past few years | The car is just 100 fun to drive and own | People smile when you pass by and my kids think Dad is the coolest | The car handles well for an solid axle performance car | The ride is not rock hard but firm | Gas mileage is actually decent getting between 19-25 mpg if you keep a light foot | Push the pedal and watch the car go | If you need even more power get the 500 HP Shelby GT500 | This will do the job on your Hemi Challenger and the new Camaro | The 18 rims and tires are a must they fill out the wheel wells nicely | Shaker 500 audio is almost audiophile quality | Have fun |

 "words": Love driving around in my Mustang | The ride is a little harsh but then again it is a sports car | Very responsive handling and performance for a V6 | Gas mileage is good considering my right foot is heavy | Got the interior upgrade and it looks great | Love the retro look since I always wanted a 69 Mustang | I have the Pony package and have tinted the windows and put the Roush quarter window covers on it looks impressive | Bottom line is it is fun to drive and doesn't cost an arm and leg | New Challenger might be more powerful but when you drive in Vegas you can only go so fast to the next red light | 
 "words": Lifelong owner of sport sedans from Far East or Europe | Living out a childhood vision of owning a sports car with a great American V8 | Car is engineered around the powerful engine not much else | Unlike products from other domestic makers the understated styling and lack of cheezy exterior add-on is quite appealing | Obviously this is a recreational vehicle so it does not dissappoint great engine sound accelaration is pretty linear and suspension is a good compromise | Not meant to make social statement so no complaints about 15 to 24 mpg | Overall not a perfect car and not for everyone but just a fun personal toy to have in your garage | 
 "words": Had my convertible now since May | My 2 year old loves going for a top down ride | The wife even likes it | I love the car but it is nowhere near perfect and is about to get some serious competition | 
 "words": Back in 02 I owned an LS1 z28 camaro and loved it | It had speed looks and its only downfall was its drivability in the winter | As a result I purchased an 05 Subuaru sti which i also loved | However I put a lot of miles on it so I decided to trade it in and go back to the muscle cars by getting a Ford Mustang | This is anything but a muscle car | Maybe I've been used to cars that were actually fast but this car isn't at all | It feels more like a v6 honestly | The looks are very nice and the interior is ok | The drivability and handling of the car is average at best | Overall I'm very sad that I purchased this car | It's not what I thought it would be and I look foward to trading it in |
