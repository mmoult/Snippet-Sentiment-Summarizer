REVIEWS
 "words": I have owned at least 7 brand new cars in the past 15 years | Will not buy a Subaru again | My car is less than 2 years old only has 8000 miles on it the rattling noise while driving is very disturbing and annoying | I read the same feedback from another owner too | And when you fist turn on the engine for the first 3 minutes it sounds like a diesel truck | Is this because the engine is tilted 90 degrees and there's no oil around the pistons going side to side | Very disappointed not to mention that there is hardly any room in the back | I will definitely stay away from Subarus | This was a worse experience than my last new car Nissan Sentra 2 | 0 | 
 "words": Have owned this 2 | 5i for 2 years without any problems | Bought new and has only been to dealer for maintenance checks oil change tire rotation | Fun to drive | Back seat passengers are a little cramped though front seats are very comfortable | Mileage is better than EPA | Gets at at least 20mpg in town and 29 on the highway | Cargo area is wide and long | Have hauled a Hoosier cabinet and a large entertainment center | Would be nice if hidden side storage compartment doors would stay on only thing on OB that is flimsy | Love my Outback | Best decision ever made | My OB 2 | 5i is a PZEV and it is not loud | In fact my neighbors call it the stealth car because it is so quiet | 
 "words": I've had my Outback Turbo XT with manual transmission for just over a year and I must say that I've found the perfect match | I love how I can change the driving style by a click of the button if I want to accelerate off a red light like Andretti I can by flipping the S button and boy do you feel that power | If I want to take it easy on a longer drive or in traffic and conserve gas flip it to I and I can rest at ease knowing my car is doing its best to conserve energy | The fact that the clearance on my Outback beats most large SUV's is phenomenal for a car this size | I've gone off- roading in Big Bend and I've been able to go down trails Explorers couldn't dream of tackling | 
 "words": Overall very nice car | Leather seats are luxurious and comfortable | Decent MPG for AWD system | Accurate Navigation system | Nice cargo room | Back seats are a little too cramped | I've owned 4 | 9L V8 4 | 5L V8 3 | 5L V6 | Maybe this is why this Outback seems so so so so so slowwwwwwwwwwww | I make sure engine revs at around 6000 rpm and this car doesn't pick up speed quite well | I should've got XT or H6 version | If you don't care about acceleration then this car may be the perfect car | 
 "words": This car is designed for driving in Maine | It handles superbly in winter conditions | The low roof makes it perfect for hauling kayaks | My avg gas mileage was always 25 in mixed driving | Last week we were in an accident in which the car rolled 1 1 4 times | My wife and I walked away with scrapes bruises and a stiff neck | Of course we were wearing our seatbelts | The car was totaled | I'm looking for another Outback to replace it | 
 "words": This is a comfortable and well performing car | I use it to tow my pop-up camper and kayaks and it's one of the few 4 cylinder cars with a high enough tow rating to do this | The AWD comes in handy in some state parks when trying to maneuver in campsites and gives a solid feeling while driving in heavy rain and snow | My gas mileage is higher than the EPA numbers which makes me happy | The load floor is long enough to swallow a lot of cargo for our family visits | 
 "words": Had the car one year kept having a burning smell that dealer couldn't fix | Deal pedal had a cheap plastic button holding that and the carpet down and mine had a horrible squeak | Took to dealer 4 times no fix | Had lots of rattles and the car seemed weak no power | I made a bad decision when I got this car and traded it in | 
 "words": I purchased my OB LTD w VDC on 4 30 08 and the car was plagued with various rattles coming from several different places | I was totally unhappy with the vehicle | I'm happy to say almost a year into owning the vehicle all the rattles have stopped | Now the vehicle rides like a new car should tight and quiet | So now I'm happy with the purchase and I enjoy driving the vehicle | Maybe the bugs had to be worked out | 
 "words": This was my first Subaru | My past 2 cars were Toyotas | I thought I'd give the OB a try | First complaint is the shockingly LOUD engine warm up due to the PZEV | It sound like a big rig truck from Mexico | I have started to notice quite a few rattles in the passenger compartment | It inconsistently shifts on hill climbs | But the biggest concern is the clunk from the rear end or transmission at slower speeds | It is at the dealer now but I'm told they were unable to reproduce the clunk | At 5000 miles a car should be a pleasure not a concern | Regretting my purchase | Going back to my trusty Toyotas | 
 "words": You'll be hard-pressed to find a family-sized wagon in this price range that has a decent reliability record | I opted for the Outback because of its very smooth ride and generous cargo space compared to similarly-priced SUVs | I have not been disappointed | Enjoyable to drive | City mileage for me 17 is a little disappointing but highway mileage 29 has been a pleasant surprise | I wish at times it had a little more power but in most cases it is more than adequate | 
 "words": After 3 years of researching I decided it was time to downsize from my Ford Excursion | I love my Excursion but couldn't stomach the cost of driving it any longer | Even though the Subaru is a world apart from my bus I am getting used to the small size | The Ltd's fit and finish compared to other crossover vehicles was far superior | It is smooth to drive and after two tanks I've averaged 28 mpg in mixed driving | I'm 6 foot tall and with the much loved sunroof the head room is tight and the leg room is adequate while the backseat's leg room is snug for adults | I enjoyed driving the XT but with the premium fuel requirement and decreased mpg I couldn't justify it | 
 "words": Have a 2002 WRX wanted a vehicle with power and handling that had more room more ground clearance and more comfort | The Outback XT fit the bill | The WRX is fun and to this point bullet proof | The Outback does not corner as well but is a fast and much more comfortable | So far so good | 
 "words": Great vehicle moving upscale to compete with the likes of Audi and Acura in the AWD crossover arena | Too bad they got rid of the steering wheel buttons paddles on the limited went to other controls for stereo and cruise | The iDrive system is cool maps the throttle response and upshift points to economy sport and sport sharp | If you keep it in economy expect mixed driving mileage at about 22-23 | In sport or sport mode expect maybe 16 mpg and lots of tickets | 
 "words": Just traded in my '01 Outback for the '08 Limited model | I had doubts about buying another Outback the last one was not much fun to drive and there were some leaking problems after 90K | After test driving all the comparables the Outback was the only one that fit the bill reasonable gas mileage good safety ratings reliable good roof rack for the surfboard and can hold 25 bags of mulch in the back when needed | So far so good | The '08 is lots more fun to drive than the '01 the sports shift option helps | A little more power than the '01 and a generally smoother better ride | I'm told that the leak problems have been resolved time will tell | 
 "words": This Subaru does well in snow is somewhat fun to drive and gets good mileage | However the interior is too small | There just is not enough leg room | When you look at the specs it appears there should be plenty of leg room but the seats are at an odd height or something so the numbers are very misleading | I'm actually thinking about selling this thing since I don't have enough leg room up front with a 4 yr old in the back | 
 "words": Car is very LOUD at first start-up cold after sitting overnight | Called Subaru about this | Said this is normal for 2 | 5i PZEV vehicle | I mean LOUD | It does quiet down after it warms up | When I went for test drive the car had been warmed up by dealer | Same thing when I went to pick-up car from dealer after purchase | I think that they were trying to hide this from me | I was told that only 2 valves are working at a cold start in order to heat up the catalytic converter faster to achieve the partial zero emission vehicle claim | Sounds like a class action suit in the making for premature engine wear in about 2 or 3 years | I would not have bought this car had I known this | 
 "words": I had a 2004 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 crew cab | I no longer need the truck to go into the woods | Several friends have Subarus | They always talk highly of them | I traded my truck in and got this vehicle | At first I wasn't pleased | It is a vehicle that takes time to get used to | I just went to NYC with my vehicle | I got 33 mpg 27 mpg in the city | If you obey the speed limits you will get very good mileage | If you need to punch it when driving it is very slow to respond | The back seat isn't made for adults | I do like the dash board display | If you need to replace 1 tire then you need to replace all 4 of them because of the symmetrical awd | Thats something they don't tell you when you buy the car | 
 "words": I love the way this car does what it does | Traded out of 1 2 ton full size pick up | I am very impressed w interior design layout and comfort | I have big feet so the pedals could all use some more spacing but is not a problem | I like the aux audio jack but wonder why its hidden the console compartment | This does make it easy to hide what you have plugged into it | Hmm | The engine power is adequate and fuel economy is great for AWD vehicle of this size | Handling and ride comfort are excellent | Note on the cruise control | would like to tap the accel decel buttons a number of times and have the speed change the corresponding number of MPH | 
 "words": As the title implies we got the car simply because no one does better in this category | Not because we are completely happy with it | We have had long and good experience with 2002 model | Quality apparently still holds | Gas mileage is somewhat better than sticker EPA estimate | Performance is appropriate for the purpose | Comfort is good and slightly better vs | 2002 | Design is clean and appropriate for the CAR Wagon what it should be Subaru please remove it from the SUV ranks | Minor ergonomic design errors location of handbrake and pedals | Major utility design errors wheels cargo space | 
 "words": I absolutely fell in love with this vehicle after I saw quite a few on the road driving around | After doing my research and going to this website www | edmunds | com and Subaru's website reading all of the great comments people had on this particular vehicle I was sold | I got the sport package with the heated seats and the heated mirrors | I think the heated seats will help me in those cold winter early mornings to work when i have to clear the sidewalks at a school where i work at | 
 "words": This car has way too many rattles ticks and squeaks | It's driving me crazy and this is unacceptable for such a new car | The rattles started one week after my purchase | I've been a big fan of Subaru for years but not sure I'd buy another one after this experience | If you're thinking of buying one definitely rent one for a couple days first | A new car should be quiet for the first few years | The car looks good but kind of too small for a family | Black leather interior is hot hot hot in the summer months | The huge sunroof is cool | The fat leather wrapped wheel feels nice in the hands | 
 "words": We just purchased an 08' Outback 2 | 5i Limited with the LL Bean package navi and VDC | We really like this car | The 2 | 5 base motor is plenty powerful around town where it sees most of it's activity and after it's first fill up we can proudly report 28 mpg | The seats are outstanding the build quality is as good as a Lexus and the huge panoramic roof is awesome | Also Subaru safety along with the excellent AWD system should help us weather the New England winters with ease | Seriously if you are looking to buy something like a RAV4 CRV or Forester give the Outback a try | It is well worth your time | 
 "words": I love Subarus and this is my 4th one | Overall I'm very happy with the car | Love the huge sunroof and leather | Comfortable quiet highway ride | But from somewhere in the rear cargo area there's a tick type of a rattle and it ruining an otherwise good car | It started one week after I drove it off the lot | Still trying to find it | Sometimes the sunroof rattles not all the time | Usually after hitting a big bump in the road this sets all the ticks and rattles going | Kind of frustrating for such a new car | If you own one make sure you set the SRS on the stereo to on | It makes a huge difference in the sound quality | 
 "words": This is the 4th Subaru I've purchased | My last one was a 2002 Outback which I found comfortable to drive | I've owned my 2008 for about 2 months and am looking to get rid of it | I started getting back pain within a week | There isn't enough foot room between the brake and gas pedals to place your foot comfortably on the gas pedal | In my 2002 the passenger side didn't have enough leg space | Now the 2008 does but at the expense of the driver side | 
 "words": This is our second Outback 2 | 5 5spd | Our first qas a 2006 Limited 2 | 5 5 spd that had a persistent air conditioner interior leak that we rolled over in at 45 mph and walked away fine | We replaced it with our current vehicle because it has the VDC | This Outback is great | the fit and finish is perfect | The XT should be purchased with the 5spd | the power of the engine in Sport and the delayed shifting is a great experience | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Outback wagon and is the best so far | It rides and handles wonderfully and I actually get better mileage than the EPA sticker indicated | 
 "words": For those of you considering the PZEV option you should be aware that when started cold some Subaru's will produce excesive vibration engine and exhaust noise | This is due to changes the ECU makes to the timing to quickly heat the exhaust catalyst to reduce emission gasses | Once warm the car starts smoothly as you would expect | The sales rep asked us to wait in the showroom while he brought the car around for test drives so I didn't discover this characteristic until I started the car the morning after purchasing it | Otherwise the car does exactly what I expected and I'm pleased with it | 
 "words": Replaced my 2006 Outback sport with the larger version | Nice upgrade and significant price increase | I liked the AWD and style of the 08 | Car handles great | Constant problem since I have owned the car is the transmission | It has been fixed twice the third time the shop could not duplicate it Going in again tomorrow | The transmission shifts hard and clunks feels like it is slipping | It was really bad the first 2 times | Now it does it under 40 MPH in city traffic | It's driving me nuts litterally | 
 "words": Previously owned a Ford Explorer so skeptical about power of 4cyl but you can't have it all and I have been pleasantly surprised with performance gas mileage | Getting 20city 29 hwy and it's plenty zippy for that king of economy | Brakes a bit unresponsive long braking distance taking getting used to but drove in the Carolina mountains and handled like a dream | 
 "words": I've had my Outback for 6 months and have put over 8000 miles on it | Initial impression of quality is good | I bought the car due to its safety features additional room for my family and reputation for quality | I haven't been let down | My only real gripe about the car is the lack of horsepower | This car could really use an extra 20 hp | Not a big deal since I'm not out to win any races | However the car is slightly under-powered in my opinion | 
 "words": This is my first Subaru | For a utilitarian vehicle it rides better than my Honda Accord | It handles great and I really like all the safety features | Easy exit entry with the higer ground clearance | Sunroof is noisy when only wing is opened | Mileage is 25 mixed and 30 on the highway | Good looks and sporty feel | 
 "words": Needed a 4 door wagon due to the new addition to my family | So I test drove an Audi A4 Avant 2 | 0T and 3 | 2 versions and the Subaru Outback 3 | 0R was on par with the Audi Avant 3 | 2 | Went with Subaru and saved 14K over the Audi | Also plan to do a lot of outdoor family stuff biking camping etc so the additional ride height with the Outback made sense | I still have yet to open it up cause it's still in the break-in period but this an excellent overall value | This car feels like I'm still driving my BMW | Subaru got this Outback right | Can't go wrong with Japanese build quality and a German driving feel at a Japanese price tag | 
 "words": Replaced gas-guzzler 3 4-ton | 05 Chevy pickup with the | 08 Outback | My requirements | better mpg able to pull motorcycle and its trailer high ground clearance w 4-WD or AWD to traverse the 2-track to my cabin in Michigan | s Upper Peninsula handle winter snow carry my radio-controlled planes and R C equipment ease of front seat access for my 85- year-old mother | Went to test drive an | 09 Forester and while waiting saw the Blue Silver Metallic | 08 Outback and changed the test drive | The test drive on poorly maintained paved roads felt comfortable and has proven so | There is a very solid feel between the car and the road | Good value | Better than a SUV for me | I like it a lot so far | 
 "words": So far so good | Wish it had better gas mileage but I knew what I would get before I bought it just did not know how much gas prices would rise | 
 "words": We looked at a number of small SUVs and wagons and went with the Outback for a number of reasons comfort MPG and functionality | The other small SUVs did not ride well and seemed cheaply made including Toyota and Honda | The ride quality in a wagon is way better and does everything I need it to do | MPG 28 hwy 22mpg city has been better than advertised which is rare | Great resale in Colorado and low operating costs | Only 500 miles on it so far so I can't comment on long term reliability | 
 "words": I've had my Outback 2 | 5i 5-speed manual for about 6000 miles and I'm very happy with it | It gets good gas mileage is fun to drive handles well deals with lousy weather very well has plenty of room and looks great | My mileage has averaged 25 | 4 mpg overall since I bought it with a low of 22 | 2 mpg and a high of 30 | 3 mpg | That's good for an AWD vehicle | With the 5-speed manual it feels lively and energetic and the manual transmission shifts very easily | It's a great all-around vehicle that can handle pretty much anything thrown at it and do it very well | It's a practical car that's enjoyable to drive | 
 "words": The Outback handles great in every day driving around town or on the highway | Steering is light and responsive | The Outback's 3 | 0R engine delivers plenty of refined power with a hint of growl | The transmission delivers that power unobtrusively | I normally leave SI drive in Intelligent mode but when necessary sport sharp mode S provides that extra punch | The Outback's raised ride height means more suspension travel take that speed bumps | and it has a smooth ride over rough surfaces | I think the Outback looks the part of a luxury wagon | The interior is upscale and comparable to my 2004 Passat | The materials feel substantial and fit and finish are excellent | Braking is very sure | 
 "words": It was tough to trade in my boy car WRX for a wagon but that's what kids will do to a guy | But with the XT one does not have to sacrifice some fun | Not quite as much fun as an audi s4 wagon or bmw 335xi wagon but a good 'total' package | 
 "words": Love the car | Did a lot of research before I bought it | I used to have a BMW 328i | driving my new Outback reminds me of the BMW | Great steering and braking | Like the 5 star safety rateing too I feel very safe and protected | I also like that I can tow my popup camper | I plan to keep this car a long time and feel it will last as long as I want to keep it | Will diffiently recommend a Subaru to anyone who is looking to buy a car | 
 "words": This is my fourth Subaru Outback | For the last 4 years I drove a Volvo S60 | The Volvo was a great car but had no clearance and was very expensive to maintain | I was excited to get back into a Subaru | I did have a problem with a tire when the valve stem came out while adding air pressure | The first dealership could not replace the original stem did not have the part and charged me for a replacement | It took a second dealership to get it right under warranty | I am also experiencing an electrical problem the radio display and wipers will cut out randomly | They are always working when I take the car in so to date the problem has not been fixed | 
 "words": Had a 1995 Legacy wagon that aspired to be an Outback | Years later I bought the car I always wanted | My big feet took some getting used to in the footbox not to say that it is cramped but pedals are closer than my Honda | I am no WRC racer but I do like how easy the clutch engages and shifting action feels great | Is surprisingly responsive when passing especially for a four banger that is a bit heavy in the hips | Excited for the snow and rain I'd like to see how the AWD handles it | Mileage is better than expected 27 in 50 50 city hwy as long as the dash computer is correct | 
 "words": We've had the Subie for about four months now | I am very happy with it | The lackluster acceleration is noticeable but the trade-off is very good fuel economy with standard fuel 25-29 mpg I suspect the tranny largely to blame for the slow feeling to the car and a fifth gear would help mpgs too | The stereo is quite weak and there is no rest for my elbows on either side when driving this car | That said the car has generally been delightful | Coming from Volvos I am impressed with the comfort of the driver seat the value half the price of the XC70 safety gas mileage and reliability | I'd strongly recomend this car-but realize that there are compromises made for mpg low price | 
 "words": This is my fourth Subie | I have owned all sorts of cars from a Mazda Miata to a Mercedes CLK AMG Mercedes SL Jaguar XK Jaguar XJ8 Lexus and several others | Subaru is one of my all time favorites especially the Outback | This is a reasonably quick versatile car with reliability second to none | This is truly one of the most comfortable vehicles you would ever want for a long trip | The ride is quiet and smooth and gas mileage is suprisingly decent | I average about 17-20 in city driving with 26-30 highway | Handling is much better than most SUVs the driving position is high with excellent visibility and it has character | Great value | 
 "words": Many improvements over the 2001 L | L | Bean we drove for 160000 miles | Has more than adequate power on the road | Find traveling to be very comfortable | 
 "words": Don't plan on the Subaru folks going out of their way to provide amenities | I have never seen a car with so few compartments for storage | No open area exists to put down your house keys so I stick mine in the very small ashtray | There is a useless added-cost armrest which makes one lose more storage space | The lighting is red for night driving so I feel like I'm on the late shift at a nuclear power plant | There are no night lights for the glove compartment or to find the Door Unlock lever | The cupholders cannot be taken out for cleaning and are not too versatile | The wind noise is better than in my last car a Forester which was very noisy | Outside visibility good | 
 "words": I like the combination of great looks dark gray good economy 23 | 5 mpg 70 city while driving briskly and the comfort of the interior | Absolutely zero problems in 19725 miles | Love the extra large moonroof and the AC copes easily with Phoenix summers | The car is everything I was expecting and more | 
 "words": This car replaced a 2001 Nissan Maxima | We got the manual with turbo and VDC | It is such a fun car to drive | It handles great and when you kick in the turbo you pass cars so quickly the drivers mouths are open | Could that be a Subaru wagon | I like the firm ride and tight handling | If you don't like really driving your car buy a Honda Accord | 
 "words": First 4500 miles impressions good handling comfortable quiet decent stereo sufficient not great power averaging 28 MPG | For around 21K 22K I believe this car is a bargain compared to other all wheel drive vehicles | 
 "words": I owned a ML350 of very questionable quality and performance and two discoverys before | I pick an Outback looking for a smaller confortable car paying almost one third of the money I paid for the other cars | A big deal | Great off road and fast in road a lot of space in a not-too-big car | 
 "words": Read all the car tests and test drove15 different cars | The Outback 2 | 5xt with manual shift just made the most sense | Very classy functional exterior design | Instrumentation better than my Audi | I'm 61 this wagon was designed for adults but with the turbo its fun to drive-easily better than a Honda CRV | 
 "words": I traded in a very nice 03 Subaru Baja and stayed with Subaru because of the splendid 5 years experience I had with my Baja | In general the Outback looks just fine and the Limited model has a nicely appointed and comfortable interior | However the MPG on the outback is not very impressive | 24 | 2 hwy recent trip and something under 20 around a very rural town | When compared to my Baja at 29 hwy and 24 town I | m loosing almost 82 miles per tank on the hwy worth 11 | 00 tank at todays prices and subject to increase in the future | All in all really wish I had kept my beloved Baja | 
 "words": I did a lot of research and really wanted to buy my 4th Honda | I looked at the CRV and didn | t like the interior | I am a fly fisherman and like to have a vehicle in which I can lie down and take a rest | I have a serious back problem and need to take breaks in my fishing day | The CRV just wasn | t able to provide a long rear floor space | When the rear seats are folded down there is plenty of room for me at 5 | 9 | Interestingly enough the Honda dealer sent us to Subaru | The Subie us everything I wanted | I am an environmentalist and biologist so my carbon footprint and controlling pollution output is important | So far we have gotten 25 mpg in mixed driving short trips a bit disapointing | 
 "words": After driving only Accords for 22 years I wanted to try something else | Subaru came to my attention on both the NHTSA site and the IIHS site for safety | Consumer Reports gave it high marks for reliability and user reports say 30mpg hwy | I have come to this conclusion after the 1st 1000 miles it is as fun to drive as a Volkswagen Jetta or Passat rated as safe or safer than any Volvo yet has a reliability rating beating both of these | Below 60 mph it is an absolute blast to drive | I don't know why but it is | My wife keeps asking to take it for her local errands | Above 60 steering is more sensitive than a Honda and is taking some getting used to | 
 "words": Traded our 2002 Bean Outback | This one is a much better performer but the interior has been redesigned for the worse | Controls were moved around to accomodate the opt | Nav | screen which should be mounted on the dash | Climate controls placed low behind gearshift audio controls lowered | You used to be able to adjust with a glance now you have to take your eyes off the road | No storage for cds or loose change | The ashtray barely holds a chapstick | Rear seats no longer fold truly flat | Parking brake lever intrudes on drivers right leg | Odometer temp etc multigauge is useless and annoying | 
 "words": Best all around value and functionality from any manufacturer | It's like taking a sedan SUV and sports car and fusing them together | Gets 30 MPG on the highway after switching to Mobil 1 5w-30 synthetic | 
 "words": We purchased an '08 Outback 2 | 5i | The car feels solid drives well and is adequate in interior comfort | The car's engine power is adequate but not impressive | We enjoy the handling of the car the most but haven't tested it in snow ice conditions yet | We've been averaging around 26-27 mpg hwy which is impressive considering the full time AWD | A knock against the car is that we've had an issue with the passenger side airbag sensor | It turns on and off intermittently | We were told it's a safety design issue for small children | My wife is approx 5'4 110 pounds and doesn't always set off the sensor | We find this odd and are researching the issue further | 
 "words": This is our third Outback H6 | We bought our first Outback H6 in 2003 | This was our introduction to Subaru's Line | Since then we purchased 2005 and 2008 H6 model versions of the Outbacks | It is most reliable and fun to drive vehicle and it seems that Subaru just got it right all the way | Every model year gets better and better | 
 "words": I loved my 2002 Outback | My second Subaru is at the opposite end of that scale | This 2008 is like a tunafish can in comparison | Very uncomfortable | Seat does not go that far back and is uncomfortable for a 5'8 driver | Ride is rough Gas mileage is only 22-23 mpg expected more | Tires are small | Overall very disappointed and will never buy another Subaru | How could a car change for the worse so quickly | Can't wait to get rid of it | 
 "words": I have had my Outback for a month | This is moms car and I love it | I have an 11 year old daughter and she and I go do a lot of outdoor things | I have already driven in snow and the traction was great | My neighbors were sliding on the snow and my Outback did fine | I'm enjoying driving this car | I like that everything seems convenient to reach for me | My husband is 6'4 and he actually has headroom | I had looked at the Honda CRV too but I just kept coming back to my Outback and happy that I did | Love driving it get a lot of comments on it even the boys at the carwash told me they like the inside | I'm driving mostly in the city | I'm getting 22 | 8 and look forward to taking this camping | 
 "words": This replaced a 98 Legacy wagon and is an incredible improvement especially the interior | I have the PZEV version and had read that people were having engine problems in cold weather but the recent few subzero spells have been no problem at all | The 4 cylinder 2 | 5 is more than adequate but if you want real umph get the turbo or 6cyl | This has more power than my 98 Legacy yet it still gets better mileage | 
 "words": Subaru has dominated rally racing for decades and it shows | Their full-time symmetrical VTD AWD system and their electronic stability control are STILL vastly superior to the nearly useless slip and HOPE to grip modified FWD systems found on the pretenders | We drove EVERY AWD NHTSA top safety pick vehicle under 40K | I forced my wife to try emergency steering maneuvers at 65 mph | The Hyundai santa Fe and Honda Pilot were scary even the Acura RDX could not match the Outback's go where you point it highway stability | Having now driven the Outback on a lot of snowy icy it has dramatically exceeded my already high expectations | 
 "words": This is my wife's car I have been very impressed | Excellent handling especially in the awful winter we've had in WI | Exterior and interior are very well done | Fit and finish is very good | The wagon utility is unquestionable | I think the car is very good value with the AWD and what you get in terms of extras with the LL Bean addition | Nav system is very good the stereo is actually quite impressive | My benchmark is my 2008 Acura RL AWD and considering the Subie is close to half the price I think it's an extraordinarily good value | My only issue is that considering the cars weight I think the base 2 | 5 liter engine is a little underwhelming | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Outback | I wanted a station wagon but few auto makers have them | It basically came down to a Subaru Outback or a Mercedes station wagon | I opted for the Subaru which seemed far more practical and easier to maintain | 
 "words": This is my first Subaru and perhaps my last | After having a fun and wonderful drive home to Michigan from Virginia my Outback gave me a full light show | Most of the warning lights came on the most interesting being the check engine light | Computer problems | It has been back to the dealer service department 3 times now | It has been in the shop for more then 2 weeks | I bought it on 12 12 07 it has approx | 3100 miles on it and I just made my first payment | The service department has been great but my first Subaru experience has been a headache and a heartache | Will be using the lemon law if the car returns to the shop for a 4th time | Otherwise a great and fun car | 
 "words": I really enjoy the handling and the way the car feels when driving it | With two kids in car seats and two adults up front it feels small inside | But I went from a Ford Excursion to this car | The gas mileage combined city highway and driving it hard is 23 mpg | if you drive it nice it is like 27mpg all highway you can get around 30mpg | The backseat just needs to have more room |
