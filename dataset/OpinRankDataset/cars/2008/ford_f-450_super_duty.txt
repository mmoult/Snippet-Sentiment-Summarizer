REVIEWS
 "words": I had originally reviewed this truck well over a year ago | Since that time I've had the rad replaced twice and then a loss of power problem | Ford replaced the fuel pump but that didn't fix the problem | After 6 months of back and forth they finally figured out it was the high pressure pump | Towing a 18K lb trailer was a challenge on a recent trip when the truck kept losing power | Thankfully they finally fixed it | I have to admit Ford did help out in the way of giving me a rental vehicle and covering everything under the Powertrain warranty | But would I buy another one | Nah | Should have gone for one of those Freightliners |
