 "words": I bought a 2008 certified pre-owned Dodge Magnum SXT silver black three months ago and love it | I needed space for a part-time business photography and did not want an SUV crossover | This vehicle drives like a car and has more space and style then any mid-sized SUV on the road | The '08's are relatively rare as they have a redesigned front facia as well as interior higher-end soft touch plastics nicer center console etc | If you can find a CPO SXT with low miles for a reasonable price- grab it | I searched for 3 months and stole mine | it had 16K miles on it and I bought for 12800 | I plan on keeping this as a second car for years to come | 
 "words": i own a dodge magnum and there's no words to explained the performance and handling on this beast is incredible | One of the best cars dodge ever built | 
 "words": I read every review about the Magnum I could find before buying it as I was concerned about how the AWD would perform and if the 6 cyl was enough power | I live in NY but found the car in Iowa since they didn't make many '08's trying to find a loaded SXT AWD was difficult | I am thrilled I bought this car | The AWD works great in the snow and the 3 | 5 engine moves the car around very well | I am more pleased with the car and the performance then I expected to be | Right now these cars are a great buy and I highly recommend it | Don't be afraid of going with the 3 | 5 V6 it handles the weight of the car fine it does not feel underpowered | Blinds spots are not that bad either | 
 "words": Being 6'4 tall interior room is very important | I've had the Magnum since February and at first was worried about the 2 | 7 L V6 but having driven it to the east coast over the mountains was surprised with the power of the car | Extremely quiet ride nice stereo system | Absolutely zero build problems no mechanical problems with the car at all | Have to join the chorus that is sorry that they are not building this car any more really love it | Traded in a 1995 Dodge Spirit with 120K miles this car is a whole different ride altogether | Also considered Cadillac DTS and Buick Lucerne Magnum has a better quieter ride and is roomier | 
 "words": I love my Magnum | I think it is a great bargain and a well thought out design | It even surprises me its an American car | I've had 2 BMW's and this is way better than both of those cars | I only wish the gas mileage is better | My AWD gets a little thirsty on fuel but at least I recognize its partially due to my driving style | The interior and ride are comfortable and natural and I am surprised by how much stuff I've been able to carry in this vehicle | Its a shame they stopped making them | Hopefully they'll figure it out and bring it back | 
 "words": I went to the dealership thinking I wanted to charger | I started looking at the Magnums but I did not like the headlights | I went home and was reading a magazine that the 2008 model will be the last year but will come with a completely new front end | The 08 front end looks better than the Charger or the 300 | I ordered one immediately | This is the coolest looking car I have ever owned | It is built well rides great and performs great | I usually get a new car every year because I put on about 50k a year but I think I will keep this one at least 2 years | This will probably be a classic as only one year for the new design and the last year with few made | Absolutely awesome car | 
 "words": What a tragedy that they are canceling this car | Awesome power and soundtrack from the exhaust | Fantastic ride and classic hot-rod looks | Good but not great fuel economy but it's a big V-8 so one does not buy this car for the mileage | I ride about 30 mi on 95 every day to work and can't keep it under 90 | Comfortable and easy to drive fast | Love the MyGig radio even though it is a little confusing to use at times | Parts of the interior are a little cheap but it is a Dodge | Not a fan of the Auto-stick trans doesn't work great | Otherwise a classic pick one up before they're all gone | Boo-hiss to Chrysler for dropping the axe on it | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle looking for something that could haul my equipment and have the heart of a sports car | Man | does it ever haul | The car is roomy too | Gas mileage is not so great but the car makes up for it in raw power | I am thoroughly impressed with the SRT8 | No one even sees me coming sleek and fast | 
 "words": Dodge fires the car instead of the people that didn't figure out how to package and market a Fantastic car | I found a rare 29R package with the performance exhaust seats wheels etc | My last two cars were a BMW 5 series and an M3 | The Magnum is the best car I have ever owned period | Well controlled ride quite inside seats are incredibly comfortable very powerful and smooth engine and moves the car effortlessly and will do about anything you want plus in highway driving on my first tank of gas I got 25 | 6 mi per gallon | Crossovers the Magnum blows you out of the water | The Magnum does everything better and for less money | What else do you want | I never thought I would own a Dodge WOW | 
 "words": I wanted a sporty powerful low CG car able to pull a small trailer and haul lots of stuff | This was the only one under 50K | I recently completed a 4000 mi roadtrip and it was great | very comfortable I'm 6'4 and it didn't even downshift going up mountain passes | The lifetime powertrain warranty multidisplacement engine were big pluses | The high intensity headlights are great | turn night into day | I think the interior is ugly | 5 different colors | bad try at a retro look but I'm getting over it | The visibility isn't good and made worse by heavy window tinting | The trailer package didn't come with a hitch or wiring | The my gig system works well | great sound | 
 "words": I thought I would not like the base Magnum SE with the 2 | 7L engine I was wrong | The base engine has plenty of power for my needs | Have you mind if you're in it for power then go for the 3 | 5 or the HEMI | My whole reason for buying is comfort and gas mileage | I strongly believe that the Magnum SE for me is the best bang for the buck | It's a lot more comfortable than than the Charger SE | One other thing it comes with a lifetime powertrain | So what if the motor or trans goes out while you own it just get it replaced for free | Go test drive the 2 | 7L and you'll be surprised | 
 "words": I'm writing this just to express my anger that Chrysler will stop producing this excellent vehicle | Great perfomer has place for 5 tall people luggage | Only minus is the fuel economy in the city | All distances that I drive in a normal day are 3-6 miles with 5-10 traffic lights | Avg 13 MPG | Highway over 24 MPG |
