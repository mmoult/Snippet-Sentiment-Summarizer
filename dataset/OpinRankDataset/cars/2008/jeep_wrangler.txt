REVIEWS
 "words": I bought my Jeep Saraha Unlimited in August of '08 | I traded my Honda Ridgeline because I wanted to drive American | Big mistake | The Jeep is very underpowered | If I even tow an empty 5x8 enclosed trailer I know it is there | When I tow a single Waverunner the Jeep struggles and revs excessively | It is a good off road vehicle if that is what you are looking for | I have had Jeeps before and this one was an improvement in areas like ride and interior comfort | Keep in mind that even with the longer wheelbase the ride is still that of a Jeep | It is a lot of work to take it on a trip of 300 miles of more | It is affected by small amounts of wind and the interior is noisy | Not recommended by me | 
 "words": I traded a 2006 Mercury Mountaineer for this Jeep when it caught my eye at a used dealership | The four door Jeep looks great but its not built as good as it looks | The 3 | 8-liter V6 is a bit under powered for a SUV especially on interstate as it shifts in and out of overdrive | When the cruse is set it will very 5 mph before it shifts | I find the seats uncomfortable especially the backseats they set up to straight and with no adjustment | There is not enough storage for small things like glasses or change | I have the hard top with removable T type tops and the Jeep is fun to drive on a nice day but I think I would take the Mountaineer back in a minute it had more power w better fuel econ | 
 "words": We bought the Jeep in December of 08 and bought the 08 because they were trying to get rid of them for the new 09s | But the Jeep has been amazing | We've yet to use the 4wd but we want to | Its been to the shop once for a mechanical problem | It has the freedom top and we love it | The Jeep has been a good vehicle | The only bad thing is the back seat sits straight up and a car seat is pretty hard to fit in there | But overall a good buy | 
 "words": I LOVE LOVE LOVE my Wrangler | I really wanted the Rescue Green it was the color of my '96 Cherokee but couldn't find it with the options I wanted | I got the S package and it rocks | I do have the annoying door latch rattle and the back lift window has leaked a few times in the rain but definitely not the Freedom Top keeping my fingers crossed | The design of the water drain stinks | water runs right into the car when you open then door when it rains the doors need the hinge stops | They should include the tool needed to take off the back top too | Other than that it's been a blast and I get a lot of Jeep waves flirty smiles for being a little chick in a hot ride | 
 "words": We have owned our Jeep for a little over 1 year and are in the process of having it towed for the 4th time back to the dealer | Three times for the throttle body light and once for a problem we have heard referred to as the death wobble | The entire front end shook so violently that it rendered the vehicle uncontrollable and impossible to hold on to the steering wheel | The Throttle body issue although not dangerous leaves me without transportation and Jeep wants me to buy an upgraded warranty to pay for my own rental | At best the vehicle is unreliable and uncertainty steals the fun out of driving it | The door hinges are rusting under the paint and causing the paint to bubble | Lemon | Run
 "words": I have owned Jeep Wranglers since 1974 and I have yet to be disappointed in any way | I have owned 8 all together and at the present time I'm in a 2008 Wrangler Sahara | I don't work for Chrysler so I don't get employee discounts and I still buy Jeeps | I feel safe and free to travel at any time in any weather that the Michigan climate can dish out | My job depends on me showing up for work every day bad weather or not | And my Jeep Wrangler gives me this feeling | I know what to expect and what not to expect from a Wrangler same as you would from a Corvette or a pickup truck | I am very pleased with all my jeeps and I at the age of 60 years old I don't plan on any changes | Thank you | 
 "words": After 60 years the Jeep as we know it and have come to love is very much improved but sadly with much more to prove | I personally own the 08 Jeep JK Sahara Wrangler California Concept | I got a great deal considering the bad economy but read my other comments below to appreciate my findings | 
 "words": I have wanted a 4-door Wrangler since they first came out | What was I thinking | The first 9 months were awesome fun to drive no issues | Ever heard of death wobble | I suggest you look it up before purchasing any Chrysler product especially the Wrangler | There is a reason it is called death wobble | One reason is it scares you to death | The other is that it could cause you to have a fatal accident | It is a violent shaking of the front end of the Jeep that you cannot control | I found out unfortunately too late that this has been an issue with Jeeps for several years | And people wonder why we don't buy American | 
 "words":  My 6th Wrangler | 5th new one bought on 10 10 07 in Barberton Ohio | Love the Wrangler vehicle but this one does not compare to my other ones | Body style is awesome and comfortability is fine | Problem is the clutch is going out | Never had it off road and I've driven a standard shift my entire life so I know how to drive one | Took it to the dealer yesterday and the tech told me it was the bearing that pushes in on the clutch was rusting | Causing the bearing not to spin properly | Touch the clutch pedal and the squealing stops | They ordered the part and said I could get it put in next Wed or Thur | Then the service writer called me back and said it was not covered under warranty | 
 "words": I traded my 05 Wrangler for the 08 Wrangler in Oct 07 | I like the way it handles and being a Jeep owner for 40 years I appreciate the comfort | I'm very disappointed in the roof leaking | I have given up on the dealers attempts to resolve the problem after three repairs it's worse than ever | I had to remove the carpeting and replace the front seat covers because of water damage | I have electrical problems resulting in the vehicle not starting leaving me stranded 25 miles in the back woods | The jeep dealership has been unable to find the problem | I already have over 50000 miles on the car and have spent lots of money attempting to resolve the problems | I wish I'd keep my 05 Jeep | 
 "words": I have been wanting a Jeep for 10 years and now finally I have my own | I have had it for 2 weeks and I love it | The feeling the community the Jeep life | Yea it sucks gas and it takes 55 dollars to fill up | Who cares | It's a Jeep | i just love it | It is one of the few convertibles for men
 "words": I've owned this jeep 3 months and in the past month have had nothing but problems with it | The fan belt has come off 4 times | The dealership had to replace the motor at 1664 miles put on a new alternator at 1700 miles and it has been in the shop for a week this time waiting for a new power steering pump | Every time I drive it in snow deeper than 6 8 inches deep the fan belt comes off which then causes the power steering fluid to spray all over the engine compartment | Now when I use the heater I have to open a window to get rid of the burnt power steering fluid smell so it doesn't make me sick | I haven't even taken it 4 wheeling yet | These are definitly not the Jeeps they used to be | Don't buy one | 
 "words": This is my first Jeep but after having a GMC Jimmy there's no comparison | Steering is light but responsive corners well and the highway ride is much improved over past generations | Noise is still there but not dominating | Engine isn't a powerhouse but with the 6 spd that's up to the driver and it can go fairly well | No problems with the roof or door seals | Suspension is firm but in town it doesn't have a problem absorbing northern Alberta potholes | If you want a cushy ride buy a Crown Vic | I plan to have this thing for a long time and so far so good | 
 "words": This is my third Jeep Wrangler and the best one yet comfortable and stylish | The all wheel disc brakes are a nice feature very comfortable seats its a blast to drive | Negatives The side doors leak bad in rain there is a TSB23-002-08 Tech Service Bulletin to repair the problem for free | It will take a full day at the dealer for this to be completed | The engine power is less than my 2000 Wrangler on the highways | 
 "words": Had a CJ-7 from back in the day and there is no comparison | This Jeep corners better than my car | True the engine shifts a bit more than one would want and the milage is quite poor but one purchases a Jeep for other reasons | Love the flexibility of the freedom top | No issues with water leakage | 
 "words": I owned a 78 CJ 5 and loved it | Have had trucks every since | All have been 4 wheel drive | My new Jeep has been a joy | Mileage hasnt been an issue since I have driven 4 wheel drive pickups so the 22 I am getting is a plus | Not a speed demon by any means but I am not into raceing | The thing will turn on a dime and handles great | Serves the purpose it was purchased for | It really does turn heads | Stereo is nice addition | Love the 3 peace top | Have had no leaks and wont have top on much in the summer | Heater doesnt keep up with the low single digit but its a Jeep | Will go anywhere | 
 "words": Originaly bought to tow behind our A Class RV | This it does with no problems | After towing down to New Mexico and using on the highway for journeys bup to 300miles and now using off road on the forestry trails etc we can only say what a great fun and accomplished vehicle this is | Easy to use soft top fantastic go-most places great turning circle and handling make it a fun fun fun car | Only downside is after a few months you feel it would be even better with at least a five or six speed auto | No I dont want a manual thank you | Ratio between third and top is to wide | Overall my wife and I rate it a Thumbs Up | Dont try and think its something its not | Just drive it and enjoy | 
 "words": This is simply a fun vehicle | It has good room comfort and good safety features | Can't wait for the warm to take the top off but the Atlanta inch of snow was pretty fun too | Nope not a little Hummer | 
 "words": The new Jeeps are very fun and much more easy to drive | they ride very comfortably | The problem is my door hinge was not bolted on all the way and now the brake light has come on and staying on | No fluid leak no loss of fluid | 
 "words": This is the first Jeep I have owned | I had a salesman who told me that I was buying a fun vehicle that would keep me smiling and enjoying the outdoors and the kids would never want to get out of it | It was not for commuting or long trips | He told me it would be noisy on the highway because of the flat front and box design it would be bouncy and not great on gas mileage | He has been right on all fronts | I did not go out to buy an economy car a smooth ride or fancy interior | Thats not what Jeep is offering | 
 "words": I just bought my first Jeep | Oh my gosh it is awesome | My friend had one in high school back in the midwest and we used to mud every weekend and it would never stall in the water | Then he got a stinking Toyota and you couldn't go through six inches of water before it stalled | I love mine so far | I have only put a hundred miles on it but it rides amazing | I am taking it up to the Sierras this weekend to check out the off roading | The only bad part is it is so nice I don't want to get it dirty | It is nice to own a piece of American History | My wife and I already established we will own this forever | With a lifetime warranty why not | 
 "words": This is my 1st Wrangler and I love it | The drive is much smoother than I expected I love the interior | The MPG could be better but I bought it knowing this | Great SUV I love the style and great look of it | 
 "words": I purchased a brand new 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara and it is junk | 1500 miles and so far 4 problems | Massive Freedom top leak that leaks down on the dash into the radio and speakers everytime it rains | Muffler heat shield loose | Drivers side heat shield loose | Factory Sirus radio TSB issued because radio sounds like speakers are blown out | Trading a used car in because I wanted the security of a new jeep and what a dam mistake | Car has been down at the dealer for 3 days now | Didnt want to give rental until i called Jeep directly | Jeep will only give 40 a day | Jeep quality is horrible along with gas mileage | Cant wait to see what goes next | I reccommend to anyone the life bumper to bumper 
 "words": Wow | After owning my 4-dr | Sahara now for several months I still look forward to every time I want to drive somewhere | First of all the hard tops do not leak if you put them on properly | The most important thing is putting the panels on in the right order and tightening from side to side until both anchors are tight | nuff said | This vehicle can maneuver brake corner and is very smooth | What other vehicle on the market looks cool has one of the highest resale values is a great 4WD it's convertible virtually waterproof and is practical and fun to drive | I would've liked a lil more power but there are upgrades to handle that | good job Jeep | 
 "words": This is the 6th Jeep I've owned | It's very well built | The seats are very comfortable | Sirius satellite radio is awesome | Gas mileage is 16-17 with most being around town so far | The hard top works well with no leaks so far and I've been out in quite a bit of rain | My only true concern is how underpowered the engine is | It upshifts on any type of hill and just needs more torque | There's room in the engine bay for a larger gas or diesel engine | 
 "words": I have had many 4x4's but none of them ever compared to my new unlimited | I now know what the word fun to drive means | It performs in all types of situations so far I have had it on ice in deep snow mud and to a wedding | It recieved more attention then the bride | Thank You Jeep |

 "words": Driving on the open road is terrific have yet to take it off road | Because of the low gearing of the transmission you must be ready to take off when the light turns green | This is were more power is needed without question | Love the seats which are curved like sport seats to hold you in place | 
 "words": I had reservations on buying a Wrangler after reading the expert reviews | But I always wanted a Wrangler- and after seeing the 2008 2 Dr Sahara- I had to buy one | I never even test drove one | now I have driven it nearly 5000 miles- including a 1500 mile trip over the Smokey Mountains w ave of 21 MPG and as high as 23 | I know perfomance is not of my Hemi Ram or Corvette | but better than my Tahoe or Saturn Ion | I expected comments on it's great looking exterior- but nearly everyone remarks on how nice the interior is appointed | The ride is very smooth on interstates-seats are very firm and supportive | cannot wait for summer to take the tops off | Why did I wait to buy this Jeep | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Wrangler | Had an '02 and '04 and just traded in my '04 for the new '08 model | The engine on this model is significantly more quiet and has better pick up and gas mileage than my previous models | The additional 6 of length and width also make the new model much more comfortable to drive on the highway | I got the 2dr Sahara with the MyGig Navigation and the Power Group windows and locks | The MyGig is awesome loaded 2GB worth of music | The new softtop is cool because you can fold back the portion over the front seat without having to remove the entire top | My wife who currently drives a Z71 Tahoe now wants the 4 door Unlimited with Freedom Hard Top | I highly recommend | 
 "words": I love this Jeep it's my first one and I'm totaly satisfied with the ride and reliability | I only have two problems one is that the roof leaks I have the 3 piece hard top and the other is that the front bumper gets damaged to easily | regarding the first problem with the leak I brought it in and the dealer changed the rubber sealthat didn't work I called the dealer back and he told me that this has been a problem with the freedom top and to bring it back in and maybe I could get a one piece top that doesn't leak | The problem with that is the weight you would need 3 people to take off the roofboo | I'm just gonna wait and see what else jeep can come up with to fix this problem | 
 "words": I have a two door automatic with a hard top without the s package | It is a basic Jeep but it will do everything I want it to do and more | I have had 5 previous Wranglers but this on is so superior in every way it is ard to belive | It is a Jeep so jthe ride lets you know you are driving not sitting on a couch | With the hard top it is secure and quiet | It does enjoy gas but I knew that when I bought it | The rear seat acccess is awful but I don't ride in the back seat | Water runs in when you open the door in the rain and goes right into the door storage pocket so only put water proof stuf in it | It is a Jeep you deal with it and sit back and enjoy the ride even if it is a little rough | 
 "words": My Wrangler is the most fun SUV I have ever driven | I am amazed at how the Wrangler can corner like a car | There is little or no lean in corners | Its a little under powered but nothing terrible | The ride is really quiet with the hard top but honestly the ride is bouncy | No blind spots but I did put small mirrors on it | Gets tons of looks from people | The 2DR has very little space for cargo but back seat removes easily | Awesome seat adjustments | Awesome view when driving | You can almost drive this truck like a car | Getting in and out of the Sahara is not pleasant for short people | Seats are comfortable | Stereo dash is high and close | Fog lights are awesome | Bumper is killer | Love my JK | 
 "words": This is my third go-round w the Wrangler | I have owned a '95 YJ College an '03 TJfirst married and have now settled into the 4dr JK w children | The new 4 doors are functional with the new additions to my family and I do not have to sacrifice driving a cool vehicle | This is not a speed machine by any means yet is fully functional for on road usage and the offroad capabilities speak for itself | The gas milage is fair given the ride height and lack of aerodynamics | If you own one of these you are in the club | If you want an Escalade experience when driving then keep shopping | 
 "words": Owned 03 Liberty traded it for 08 Wrangler 4 door in mid-September and love it | We avg 300 miles a week commuting and the car gets between 17- 19 miles a gallon | Seats are comfortable car handles well | Gets lots of looks | Owning the Jeep is like owning a piece of Americana | This car is steeped in tradition | Once you remove the soft top from the rear and the hard top is on there is plenty of cargo space | Handles well if you're driving along at 70 plus miles an hour | Yes there is wind noise but mostly at high speeds | Nice speaker system | It's 50-56 dollars to fill the tank 3 | 00 a gallon when close to empty | Nice hidden compartment in the rear to hold an ER Kit | I'm extremely satisfied |

 "words": My husband and I have owned ours now for three weeks and it is the best Jeep we ever owned | We have had Jeeps all our lives from the years of 1977 1986 1993 1999 and 2002 | This Jeep is a smooth ride handles very well almost like my Eagle Talon TSi all wheel drive I owned in my early 20's | Not as luxurious as my 2003 Suburban Z71 but I didn't order it with that expectation | It actually came darn close | Who wants leather and plush seats in a convertible that is expected to get wet | Can't do that with my Suburban | Simply put we love it and it is a better ride than a 2001 Cherokee and larger than one | The new Jeep is so quiet you cannot even hear or feel the engine idle or shift up or down when driving | We got 23 | 5 mpg with three kids a 55 lb dog a cat me my hubby and our cage with clothes on back | Awesome what more can I say |

 "words": OK to start off let me say I'm a foreign car guy | Ever since my first experience with taking my 1995 Dodge to the shop on a weekly basis it's been nothing but imports | That being said this is the best product Jeep has put out in quite some time but don't forget those beautiful little words | Lifetime Powertrain Warranty | I have 2500 miles on my 2 Dr Sahara so far and it is rock solid | No squeaks rattles in fact the ride is nothing short of spectacular for a vehicle with it's suspension type and the short wheelbase | Sure it's not Lexus quiet but that's not what you're buying | There is high speed wind noise and you aren | t going to win any road races but that shouldn't be expected here | 
 "words": We've had 13 Jeeps between the two of us in our lifetime | From a 77 Cherokee to the most current model year an 02 Grand Cherokee Limited | Retiring a 93 Wrangler that was my daily driver for the last 13 years for this model and we both are extremely pleased | The ride is impecably smooth even for a Wrangler but so much more car like | It is so quiet you forget your in a Hardtop unlike the 93 Wrangler with the hardtop | People had trouble hearing me on the cell phone | Unlike the 4 | 0 in the 93 which could be heard easily you can't hear the 3 | 8 motor and you forget you have it running | Factory remote start rocks | Opt for it it's worth it | It's 10 | 5 inches bigger than an 08 Liberty | 
 "words": I love my Jeep | Looks great | Drives great | Much more room than I ever anticipated | Cannot recomend it more | 
 "words": I have owned several Jeeps | A 94 Cherokee and 97 TJ Wrangler | After a brief and dull experience with a Chrysler Town and Country minivan I got my Jeep back | Yes everything about the Jeep is well Jeepish | I have the hard top model so wind noise is not that much of a big deal and I like the fact that I can take the front panels off on a nice day | They are light and easy | On a rainy day I have seen the top leak once and after reseating it not more leaks | I have the manual 6 speed so power is not that much of an issue | Get the power and door lock option if you have a child | My wife hates that we did not get this option |

 "words": This is a very fun vehicle to drive | Gets lots of looks so be prepared to be asked questions primarily how much they cost | I guess people think they cost a lot more that they do which makes it a value in itself | The only thing I have to remark on is the position of the arm rest both on the door and the console | I am 5'8 so not abnormal in height for a woman | the center console is pretty low and there is no arm rest on the door | However keeping in mind that this is not a luxury car and not bought for comfort I really can't complain | Love it love it love it and really happy with the Jeep | 
 "words": Although I have only had it a couple of weeks I am fully pleased with the Wrangler Unlimited Sahara | I left behind a Cadillac CTS at the dealer and really haven't looked back | The Jeep's ride is not as bad as some say | You should know what your getting but I was actually pretty surprised by how comfortable it is | Power and mpg suck but I am going to address that with the savings on payment and insurance costs by adding a cold-air intake exhaust and flash-programmer | From the documented dyno results I don't think I will have any complaints going forward | Final word practical 4 door convertible | The REAL ultimate tanning machine | 
 "words": I have owned 4 jeeps similar to this one | The jk has the smoothest ride so far | All the nice things in the S package are great | I was really shocked about the drips and wind noise- -the worst ever | But my local jeep dealer in Clarion PA fixed the problems |

 "words": I have had 2 Jeep Cherokees but didnt realize I never had a real Jeep till I bought this | I got the limited slip rear axle and rarely had to use 4wd through a fairly tough Illinois winter | Have had no problems thru 33000 miles get 20 mpg hauled my 21' boat to Canada my camper to Oklahoma and many business trips | My only complaint is that whenever I take the freedom top and doors off the Jeep disappears my wife takes it | If I had to do it over I would have gotten the power windows and locks but other than that I have no complaints | The 4 door model is practical for families and it is just so much fun in both the winter and in summer with the top and doors off it rocks
 "words": This is the second Jeep I have owned | By far the best ride but there are too many Plastic parts i | e | the skid plate grill and door interior | I improved my mileage by 3 mpg and horsepower by 23 with after market products | Great off road performance | A joy to drive | 
 "words": This Jeep is our 8th in 20 years and it's quite an improvement over the previous generations going back to our very first CJ-7 | We use our Jeeps as daily drivers and they spend a considerable amount of time off-road camping hunting fishing and exploring | Jeep has made the Wrangler more comfortable in all aspects plus it's still highly modifiable like a big Lego set and we have purpose built ours to fit our specific needs | If you demand luxury and on-road perfection then this model is not for you | however if you need a 4 door with above average off-road prowess and can embrace the inherent quarks found in an open top Jeep then this is the perfect vehicle for you | 
 "words": I purchased it used with 8K and have had it for 2 weeks | I have to admit it's one of the most fun cars I've owned | The ride is great compared to earlier years | Get the 6 speed over the sluggish automatic | Summer is coming and I have both tops soft top is going on in 2 weeks | As far as long term reliability can't answer that yet | 
 "words": I have owned a few Jeeps and this one does have a comfortable ride compared to the others | Mine is a right hand drive I use to deliver mail | Any snow at all and I have to use 4 wh | drive or the right rear just spins | With 4 wheel I have had no problem | Auto | trans | feels soft | Will roll backwards on the slightest incline when you take your foot off the brake and you are in Drive | Have to use a lot of throttle to force a downshift when climbing any grade | Leaks in around top of doors | Rear window washer hose comes loose and sprays fluid all over the interior | Engine is noisy when you first start it at 20 degrees or below | Steering damper is shot at 16000 miles | Tires wear fast |

 "words": I will give credit to the fact that the new style rides and handles a lot better for everyday driving | The tractions control is a feature that should never have been added as I have found while pulling out into traffic on snowy roads the vehicle hesitates to get going and have almost been hit | There also seems to be a power band in every gear which gives it a sluggish feel when accelerating not impressed | I think the people at Chrysler should have just stuck with the 4 | 0 litre | The tire pressure sensor likes to come on when its cold out and the Change oil indicator comes on and doesn't shut off even after changing the oil | 
 "words":  I love Jeeps have owned them for years and find this one to be much better or more well rounded than previous models | The power of the V6 is barely adequate but with the stick it does OK | Not sure how one would do with less than the 4 | 11 gears in mine | Fit and finish is good the paint is flawless | The seats are comfortable for my bad back large enough to use my portable lumbar support | It rides better than previous models and handles well too given it is built primarily for an off-road vehicle | Soccer moms forget it you would not find the rough ride is a good replacement for your Lincoln Navigator | The only problem I have had and continue to have is hardtop leaks | 
 "words": Always wanted a Jeep but need an everyday drive vehicle | This feels the order now rides smooth and low noise | Averaging around 20 MPG | I have the freedom hard top and was in the rain once AZ and car washes with no leaks | I was out this weekend and drove 1300 miles and was very comfortable | Offroad capabilities speak for itself | I did some things that we held out breath | On the trip I drove over a mountain pass with over a foot of snow on the road and I didn't use need four wheel drive | I love my Jeep |
