REVIEWS
 "words": Does everything well instead of compromising one performance area to excel in another | For example corners as if on rails but preserves quiet comfortable ride | The engine is smooth and quiet around town but makes operatic noises at the top of the rev range | This is the perfect luxury car for with enough confidence to eschew driving a visible status symbol | I drove Audis before they went upscale to compete directly with Mercedes and BMW | This Acura now fills that niche of artful understated luxury that makes one look smart not status conscious | 
 "words": Great handling feels like the vehicle is glued to the road due to the SH-AWD | Requires high test although gas mileage is reasonable | Excellent acceleration for a 4000 pound vehicle | Roomy high tech voice command system fabulous 5 | 1 surround sound and backup camera which I wanted | Also has manual shift via paddles on the steering wheel and Acura reliability | Everything works as intended | Drive one you'll buy it |

 "words": I got my RL top of the line by the end of Nov | 2007 | So far it's fine | It drives well with very good highway mileage considering AWD | The average mileage rate was over 30 mi gal in long distance driving | Before I purchased it I searched the market well | For about 50K Mercedes BMW Audi were some offering their stripped versions | If you own the top of the line luxury car your dealer treats you like a king for maintenance calls your loaner there if need be | One thing was bad about these sports cars they are so low | Even cement divider on parking lots touches your fender if you are not careful | Tires are so expensive PAX system | If you damage it prepare to pay 500 per tire change | 
 "words": This car is so good I wouldn't want to know the person dissatisfied with it | Too spoiled | Excellent reliability | Excellent safety | Excellent road holding in bad weather | The quietest car I've ever experienced | Excellent stereo | Comfortable seats for me | Pleasant styling | Like most Acuras will probably look fine in 10 years | Cadillacs and BMWs will probably look silly dated | The only thing you get in 2009 is an ugly restyling 10 more hp and a significant loss in economy | 2008 is a optimal year | It doesn't feel like a toss around car | Too heavy | Reasonable back seat | Everything about it inspires confidence quality road manners rubber on the road balance | It does everything well

 "words": I love my new Acura RL fully loaded | I've owned all of the major players including Lexus BMW and MB | You really owe it to yourself to go test drive this amazing car if youre looking at 40-50K cars | 
 "words": Bought the RL Tech pacakge | 2nd day noticed major quality problems | Rattling noise from all over the place | Owning the car for 6 weeks so far and several parts are replaced | Windshield and headliners are all taken apart due to major manufacturing defect | Honda corporate really doesn't care about customers the only thing they care is talk nicely but no action to solve issues | 
 "words": I have had them all | Audi BMW 535 Infinity Lincoln MB E350 | I couldn't believe the RL when I drove it somewhat reluctantly | Incredible road hugging and plenty of power with 300 hp for a v6 | You can punish this car and it keeps coming back for more | I almost went for the Lexus GS 350 but felt it was rough riding and a little noisy compared to the RL | The GS 460 would have been more fun but much more expensive | Great technology and maybe the best GPS and Bose stereo with noise abatement | Cabin is whisper quiet | I got 26 mpg on 160 mile highway trip | Not bad | Fit and finish among the best | I will enjoy this car for 36 month lease I know | 
 "words": I have had all the luxury sedans | You name it and I have had it including BMW MB Jag and Infiniti | I leased the RL with a few doubts but it is a driver's machine | The 4 wheel drive is really amazing and you can push this car hard on the curves and it comes back for more | Fit and finish is superb | I look forward to the office commute every day | 
 "words": I've only had my new RL for three days but so far I love it | I previously had an Acura TL which I liked a lot but wanted an AWD vehicle which was a little smoother on the road than the TL | I hesitated a bit on the RL because of both its cost and the exterior design which I liked okay but not as much as the TL | I test drove an Infiniti EX and G35X a Toyota Highlander Volvo S60 and S80 and looked at a number of other cars | I also drove the Acura RDX | The RL is the most enjoyable car I've ever driven and I recommend it fully | Buy it | 
 "words": An excellent car except for the ability to see the road at night | Excellent quality handling and comfort | However the HID headlight aiming system is way too low a law suit waiting to happen | It is pure terror driving downhill on a windy country road at night | The headlights are aimed into the ground but the dealer claims they are aimed correctly | I would rate this car a 10 during daytime driving but a 2 for nightime | If I had test driven this car at night I wouldn't have bought it | On the plus side I am getting near 28 mpg highway which is much better than the EPA sticker rating | Excellent steering and road performance | 
 "words": We cross shopped Audi A6 Q7 Infiniti M35x Cadilac CTS4 Acura TL and RL after we returned a 2006 BMW 530xiT | We finally decided to lease an RL because it has all the basic elements of being a luxury car | This is the 4th Honda Acura we had owned so far | And probably the most conservative Honda Acura we ever have | Having said that the RL is still a wonderful car to drive | Only hope 3 years later Acura can have another face lift base on the coming 2009 RL it is NOT attractive at all plus a RWD-biasd AWD | Then I think we will continue to be in the Honda's family | 
 "words": I compared the RL the M35x all wheel drive autos | I found them to be very similar | Although the M35 might be slightly faster off the line I felt more comfortable in the RL driver's seat and was surprised by the sporty firm suspension | The M35 may also win the looks category but the RL dresses up nicely with the factory flaps and spoiler | Having owned an Infinity and a Honda Acura previously I expect the RL to be more reliable and less costly to service | What really swayed my decision to the RL was after negotiating on both cars the 2008 RL ended up thousands less than the M35 | After a couple thousand miles I am extremely happy with the RL | 
 "words":  Traded in 2003 3 | 2 TL | Had A4 before that and living in Northeast missed the AWD | Ratings lower for fun to drive as it is a matter of what you want | a small fun car like an A4 or BMW 3 Series to zip around and corner in or the luxury of a bigger car | I went for the luxury and am happy I did | The lower rating for the exterior design is because let's be honest this does not have the flash of some rivals | Otherwise I love this car | Great upgrades interior loaded with bose stereo bluetooth nav | system | AWD fantastic thru 3 snowstorms that would have crippled TL | Car is solid and feel safe | Lot of highway getting 21 MPG | TL never a prob anticipate same or better with RL
 "words": I cross-shopped the Lexus IS GS BMW 5 series and the Acura RL | Stayed away from Mercedes due to past experience | RL provided the most rewarding driving experience combined with the most features for the money | It is also very reasonable to insure | Fuel mileage has been in the 17-20 mpg commuting in traffic | 
 "words": I just traded in my 2005 300C and I have to admit I miss the Hemi but having said that I love this car | Though I never had any mechanical problems with my Chrysler I didn't have the confidence that the car would hold up long term | The RL has something about it that makes you believe you can drive it forever | Not only is the car solid but Acura has paid attention to the details owners care about | Quiet ride great stereo system a navi system that is easy to use comfortable seating pleasant appearance and for me all wheel drive | I plan to put a lot of miles on this car |
