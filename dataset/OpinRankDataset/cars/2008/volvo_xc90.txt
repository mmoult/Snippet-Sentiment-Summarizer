REVIEWS
 "words": Leased our 08 XC90 V8 AWD with Premium Package and Bi-Xenons in Feb '08 | Best car we've ever owned | 24000 miles on it so far and love it | No problems | Perfect size | spacious inside 3rd Row if you need it lots of cargo room if you don't | 2nd row slides fore and aft to adjust legroom where it's needed most | Excellent interior materials and quality | Drives like a dream | Yamaha-built 4 | 4L V8 is a ROCKET and has tons of passing power but will get 22-23 mpg on the highway if you set the cruise at 60-62mph | Yes this is AWD Handles rock solid in the snow if you put snow tires on it | Great car | we're definitely buying it at the end of the lease
 "words": I've driven the XC90 for 20K miles still love it | Mileage is almost always over 20 | Trips Norway Sweden 1700 miles 23 | 8 mpg | Upper Midwest 2400 23 | 4 mpg | New England 3400 miles 23 | 7 mpg | Amazingly good mileage | Comfort can't be beat | Have had ZERO problems not even one repair trip to the dealer | It will be a long time before I trade-in this car | 
 "words": I was going to buy a Lexus RX350 but told the salesman that I had another appointment at the Volvo dealership that morning | I would most probably come back to close the deal with him after the appointment | After a test drive of Volvo XC90 I changed my mind right away | The car felt smooth sturdy and macho having an excellent road grip at highway curves | I have driven the car for almost 5 months since then and never had a problem with its workmanship | Believe it or not it is also a head turner on highway | One major complaint I have about the car is gas mileage so far I have 14 | 8 m g | Another complaint is its slow acceleration but I have learned to live with that | 
 "words": The wife and I have been driving the XC90 V8 for a little over a year now | The drive is exceptional and the power is second to none | This vehicle drives like a fine tuned sports car and grips the road like velcro | The vehicle is a real head turner going down the road and at traffic lights | Dynaudio is the best | Navigation is OK but could be a little better with response times | I have missed a turn or two when driving | I am a bit surprised that some of the interior plastic decor parts pieces that cover some of the metal have fallen off and the middle console is loosey goosey when you go to store something away | We are leasing and will be turning the vehicle in at the end of 2009 
 "words": We leased this SUV after 7 leases of Volvo cars before it | We had outgrown any car they make and this is a perfect fit | Lots of room extra row of seats not much room there and all the emenities needed | The ride is solid plenty of room for me 6'2'' amd a son of the same size | The premium sound is great there is more than enough power to enter the highway safely and easily braking is solid also | Car looks great very reliable and lots of room in the back for luggage and whatever you pick up at Home Depot | The leather seats are as comfortable as at home heat is great have yet to do a summer with the black leather interior but we are not concerned | 
 "words": Great car | Enjoy the comfort of the ride | The Sirius radio is a great addition | The SUV lacks armrests for rear passengers | Lack of the armrest is huge disappointment | Lack of armrest made our rear seat passengers uncomfortable | I cannot understand why developers did not include rear seat arm rest for passenger | The styling is great | The car is eye catching | The performance of the front wheel drive is great | Numerous safety features are available | 
 "words": I've now driven almost 2200 miles with my XC90 3 | 2 | No mechanical or other problems | The ride is a bit stiff but that does help the handling | Overall it is an easy to handle car but one does notice it is big and heavy | The AWD keeps it on the road all the time and it doesn't flip flop turning corners as much as other SUV's | But it does a bit the tendency to go straight when turning corners probably based on it being a primairily FWD based car | The 3 | 2 is a nice engine with enough power to handle the car and a full load of passengers and luggage | I can imagine with the weight of the car that the V8 would be a lot nicer to drive although the mileage will be even worse | 
 "words": We got this truck because it looks great is very comfortable rates very high in safety and best of all we got 10K of the sticker price | The seats are amazing room for 7 and lots of trunk space | Great stereo system and power everything | The only problem is poor gas mileage 
 "words": This is my 2nd XC90 | Came out of a great experience in a 2005 XC90 and couldn't find anything I really wanted better | Tested a Mazda CX9 Mercedes M Class Subaru Tribeca Highlander Lexus RX 350 | and on and on | It may not have the fun zoom-zoom quality of the Mazda but the Mazda outside mirrors vibrate like crazy | rear seats vibrated | tracks in the floor looked so cheap | Mercedes was nice but didn't like the paddle shifter and it's too small cargo area | Volvo makes the most beautiful classy looking SUV | Nothing beats the feeling of quality in my XC 90 | This new engine drives great | I thought I'd miss the Turbo | Not at all | Great lease deals make it the perfect family vehicle | 
 "words": We bought the XC90 after owning a Suburban to get a smaller vehicle a luxury SUV and for the safety features | The safety features are there but this SUV is not a sturdy vehicle for active families | The middle console has come out the doors do not automatically lock unlock it rattles the seats in the back rows are difficult to lay down-just to name a few of our complaints | For the money we regret we did not purchase the Lexus or the Land Cruiser | 
 "words": The CX90 is in a class by itself | I drove the 08 MDX I've owned two but the V-6 labors it's still only a five speed the ride is harsh and the wind and road noise are too high | The BMW X-3 is a teetering joke the X-5 3 | 0 is underpowered the 4 | 4 overpriced besides which the controls are needlessly quirky the navigation screen miniscule and the 'leather' looks and feels like 2nd rate plastic | How do they sell those things | The Volvo leather on my premium is sumptuous the materials and design are great and the ride responsive but quiet with no wind noise | In short It's a great ride | And the lease was the same as the the MDX for a car that stickers for 10k more | 
 "words": I leased this vehicle and I'm glad I leased it and not purchsed | Looking forward to giving it back | The seats are uncomfortable at least the driver seat is | Blind spots visiblity isn't the greatest | I owned a Ford Explorer prior to this lease and I plan to go back to the Explorer once this lease is up | I also experience a delay when turning a corner and steping on the gas | It takes a second or two before you actually accelerate | 
 "words": Bought this XC90 after 4 years in a Caddy SRX | Looked at and drove an MDX ML350 Highlander Enclave and a BMW X- 5 | All nice well built autos but when you sit in the XC90 shut the door and drive you feel safe and comfortable | Controls are well layed out and everything is easy to use | No useless extras in the dash to play with | It has a solid feel on the road either 4 lane interstate or two lane back roads | Recently took an 800 mile round trip and averaged 22 mpg | Not bad for going 75 to 80 mph | 
 "words": We leased our 2nd XC 90 in August 2008 and couldn't be happier | Our first lease was a 2006 XC 90 with the 5 cyl | turbo and it was a mediocre performer | Way underpowered it worked so hard all the time it got horrible gas mileage and forget trying to get it to do a 50 to 70 pass on the highway | It had some warrenty work but none of the horror stories I have read elsewhere | Based on the improved reliability cited by consumer's reports we decided to lease a new V8 | It is light years better it feels like a completely different car and the gas mileage is about the same between the two | There are only minor differences between the model yrs and the incentives made them the same price | 
 "words": I got this car mostly because I needed a change from my previous black MDX and black RX300 | I got the passion red V8 Sport because it looked terrific and drove nicely on the test drive | I love this car because 2 months after I got it I was in a collision head on with air bag deployment with my two toddlers and elderly parents on the way to my daughter's birthday party and we all walked away with a few minor bruises | The tow truck driver and police officers all said to me thank God you were in a Volvo | The dealer made my car perfect again and I love it more than ever | 
 "words": Within two months the windshield crack not cover by the manufacturing warranty | Too small for 7 seaters will not fit teen for a trip | 
 "words": My fourth Volvo but SUV | A 2008 V8 Special Edition with practically all options | Paid 56000 and have no regrets | The ride is smooth steering responsive and road grip and stability far better than my wife's Acura MDX | Second row a bit cramped but as it is meant for kids and they are more interested in the entertainment system it's not a big issue | Air condition for the rear seats is on all the time as it enhances the over-all airflow | The air quality system and BLIS makes highway traffic very comfortable | I drive the car pretty hard and has a mileage below 12 but the V8 sound is so great that it's hard not to use the power | 
 "words": My wife has always wanted the XC90 so we took the plunge when the lease on our Pathfinder was up | It's a beautiful car and we've owned Volvos all along growing up | From a comfort standpoint the car is top notch | More interior room than the Pathfinder | Powerful stereo system | It was good to get the familiar Volvo safety I've been used to over the years | Only problem the gas mileage is horrible | We're aveaging 14 | 8 | But hey what do you expect for a car that is dripping in safety features that's more important Also had to drop some paperwork at the dealership one day and something punctured my tire as I was driving out they reimbursed me for the new tire | 
 "words": I was fooled into buying the XC-90 after the arrival of our first child | Truth is this has been the worst car we've ever purchased | It drives but constantly in the shop for several issues including AC problems allignment issues electronics mechanical and at one point they had to replace both front axles completely | Don't be fooled by the safety recommendations all newer luxury SUV's have good overall safety ratings | Further the car has horrible traction control in rainy conditions | If you do decide to purchase please buy the AWD | I do not let my wife and child drive this car when it rains | 
 "words": First of all horrible mileage 13 | 6 MPG average over 2 years | We had multiple problems with this SUV loose front end side frame supports needed adjustments | Needed new tires after only 20K miles | no warranty | I will say the dealer was very good about everything even though it took them 4 tries to fix one of the main problems | 
 "words": My new XC-90 V-8 is a terrific vehicle | The ride is smooth comfortable | Power from the V-8 makes driving fun | Volvo has the most comfortable seats in the business | Gas mileage has been decent at an average of 17 | 5-18 | 5 mpg in mixed local driving | This is better than my previous Ford Explorer V-8 16 | 5-17 | 5 my friend's 6 cyl XC-90 | The steering is a bit lighter than I would like but handling is crisp | The new blind spot warning system is very helpful on the highway | All in all a great vehicle | 
 "words": We came out of a BMW X5 4 | 4 and couldn't be happier | Performance is the same ride is sporty but not as stiff | we pretty much got this thing loaded and got a free Garmin Nav unit as well | Ended up with the V8 because we didn't feel the 6 cyl could do the job | Fuel economy in 600 miles of in- town driving around 16 | 5 mpg | pretty good for a heavy car | The biggest thing for us was keeping the same size SUV and getting more interior room and with the 3rd seat down there is plenty for her and the baby's stuff | We got ours at the end of the month and after negotiating they practically gave this thing away | Get the Executive pack with different leather and the blindspot info deal | worth it | 
 "words": Took delivery of this vehicle in Korea using the diplomat and military sales program | Very simple process to custom order the vehicle from the factory and saved nearly 9K over state-side MSRP | Zero mechanical or quality issues since it arrived 8 months ago | Incredibly versatile SUV for my family of five- we've used a variety of seating configurations for different trips extra guests etc | Very quiet at standstill and on highways and a nice sound to the inline 6 when you step on it | I had driven the V8 version several times before and it is more fun but I couldn't justify the extra cost and I've never felt I absolutely needed the extra power | One of the best family vehicles out there | 
 "words": Decided on Volvo for safety and built- in booster seat for toddler luxury items good 2 yr lease deal | Considered Mercedes M class for same money but ride and comfort were the worst of any SUV I've driven | Very surprised | I even test drove the M-B three times but to no avail | Acura MDX was more luxurious and had better bells whistles reliability but lease deals were poor | Only stripped down MDX was offered as a deal but adding options was costly | BMW X5 too small and clunky doors- wife hated it | Man's car | Lexus RX was wonderful but too small for our needs | Volvo has best safety record but scary reliability | I got a 2 year lease since didn't want to live with a mistake for 3 years | 
 "words": I had alway want a Volvo | Well I bought this Volvo XC-90 Jan 2008 | I was robbed | This car has been in the service dept ten times in one month | Plus still not fixed right yet | Maintenance plan is not worth the money if dealership can't fix my Volvo | My parking assist has not worked right yet | It comes up after I am finish parking | Plus side bar on SUV are too high for ladies | I thought I wanted this Volvo but now I would gave it away for a good BMW | Other bad things with this car is too tight up front very uncomfortable | After paying 50k for it gas is about high as the car | This car is not worth the money | I wish I had BMW | Don't believe Volvo | 
 "words": People you're talking a Volvo not a Honda you will live through a horrific crash you will have 311hp this vehicle is safe and because of that it weighs as much as much larger SUV's so the 13-18 mpg isn't that bad | Stop crying about fuel economy put your family in a Prius if that's important to you if you want a truly safe well built nice looking SUV this is the truck for you | Remember you get what you pay for there's a reason that this truck is over 50000 without things like navigation and rear view cameras because you are paying for safety | This is another of those imports that you can buy and still buy American Volvo is a proud member of the Ford Motor Company |

 "words": We have owned this vehcile less than 60 days and have had to have the front right blinker light replaced cracked at factory have replaced the cam shaft value as it popped off leaving a large oily mess and the 90 portion of the XC90 emblem on the back had to be straightened as it was installed crooked at the factory | We are averaging 17 miles per gallon and this is FWD | We did get a good deal based on the over 40K sticker price and final price of 36250 with dealer cash and X plan discount | This is our first Volvo and may be our last | Traded our Infiniti and have had second thoughts many times | 
 "words": My family has had a Volvo since 1981 and therefore it was not a difficult choice to purchase the XC90 | The interior is typical Volvo little bit too tight but with the highest quality to find | All seats are strong and comfortable not just the front seats as in some other SUVs | 
 "words": I recently traded my '06 BMW M3 convertible in for this SUV | I needed the space for our new baby | My rating is slightly lower on performance and fun to drive just based on the fact I have a hard time not comparing it to the M3 totally different vehicles but I'm still having a little separation anxiety | I do love this SUV | I did my research and really found this to be the best bang for the buck and it is | I have been a german car owner and vowed to never buy anything else | well Volvo won me over | The Volvo XC90 is fantastic |
