REVIEWS
 "words": i was the proud owner of a 2000 deville and just loved the car | my wife decided to upgrade we bought the 2008 dts | i think the new one is not as quiet or smooth as the 2000 also it has that same whining noise at approx 15 to 30 mph i read about in another review also it gets somewhat sluggish at 45 mph no idea why it does that | the 2000 had much softer comfortable seats anyway my wife loves the car but i'm very disappointed no way should it be 51000 dollars on the window | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle a year ago | I run a limousine company American Eagle Limousine and the Cadillac DTS is the customers vehicle of choice | It surpasses the Lincoln Town Car in exterior design | My client are always complimenting on how smooth and bump free the ride was | The car is a head turner and has been extremely reliable | I purchased this vehicle at 7500 miles and it has well over 100k on it as of August 2009 | I have not experienced any engine problems | The only problem I experienced is with the rear cup holder which has cheap build quality | Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase | I will be purchasing more Cadillacs in the future |

 "words": We owned our third Cadillac on August 31 2008 | Overall the 2008 DTS is comfortable and the engine has a lot of get up ond go | However 2008 DTS appears to be noiser than my previous 2002 Deville | From the front of the vehicle gear noise can be heard between 25-30mph | release the accelerator and the noise is gone | Below 25 or above 30 mph the gear noise cannot be heard | Suspect the transaxel | The side seat buckles in the back seat are set down too far making it difficult or next impossible for an average size adult to connect the latch to the buckle | Question have the car companies stopped using undercoat on vehicles | 
 "words": Big strong and comfortable | Quiet | Economical using regular gas long oil intervals and all this with a torquey V8 | Really well thought out | No Idrive or other difficult to understand user interfaces like the competition offers | Has all the toots and whistles including power lumbar with massage | Side radar that warns if something is in the blind zone | Rear and front parking aids | And a bunch more | Needless to say it is very comparable to more expensive foreign cars but does some things better | This car just makes you feel good when you drive it | 
 "words": This is the most beautiful auto I have ever seen | Everything about its styling pleases my eyes | There is no defect in appearance inside or out | If I had a blank piece of paper this is what I would design | Several years ago I attended a comparison drive of luxury autos sponsored by Motor Trend Magazine | I was able to test drive the best of Europe Asia and the US any way I wanted | Believe me no expensive import offers anything more than the Cadillac DTS except snob appeal | I had really planned to buy a six cylinder with a six speed transmission | But when I saw this DTS I couldn't say no | 
 "words": Great car | Handles better than the '05 Deville I traded | Smooth power from the V-8 with decent mileage for the size of the car | I get 26 mpg on the Hwy | Comfortable and quiet ride in American luxury tradition yet still decent handling | Good value for the money | 
 "words": Car is comfortable and handles well for a large car | Car has been in the shop at 500 mi and at 2000 mi for drivetrain and electronics problems | Paid 55K for this car and was not offered a loaner car by this dealership while the car was in their shop | This will be the last American car that I purchase | 
 "words": I traded a BMW 745 for a Cadillac DTS | The Cadillac lacks some of the more sophisticated technology of the BMW but it is easier to maintain it rides beautifully and is easy to get serviced | Consumer Reports recommended this car for reliability in part because it dispenses with some of the cutting edge technology and instead provides reliability and a more affordable price | The large trunk and back seat and good for carrying more passengers and luggage | We use this car as a road car for longer trips | It takes regular gas parts are easy to get and there is an extensive dealer network | GM has done an excellent job with this car | 
 "words": I purchased a 2008 DTS double espresso I like the performance on this one better than the 2004 I traded | The 2004 had better interior and sound system | I like the H | I | D | headlamps the remote start and quietness on the 08 | It could have had nicer rims and higher quality sheet metal | the trunk and lower rear quarter panels seem very cheap | I don't like the cloth on the side of my seats | It should have had a 2 -tone interior for the 33006
 "words": I took some of the advice from others on the internet and looked for a car to take long rides in | It is ideal | It is roomy and quiet |

 "words": Bought my 4th Cadillac | '94 Deville had 175000 miles | '99 Deville had 130000 | '05 DHS had 110000 | just got '08 DTS | these are true road warriors that have given this road warrior almost 1 2 million comfortable | safe miles | had a Lincoln in between the '99 and '05 Caddy | not even close to Caddy ride | When I got my first one I was only 44 | below average demographic | love the comfort | acceleration | and handling | not interested in overrated and overpriced German or Japanese | Caddy packages all options neatly | takes me 20 minutes to buy my car | always get the White Diamond | keep building these | 
 "words": I started driving a Cadillac when Oldsmobile stopped building the original Aurora | I travel from Florida to Atlanta GA and the ride is comfortable quiet and smooth my companion reads a book all during the drive | On one trip my cruise control stopped working I hit my OnStar button and they made an appointment for me at a dealership near where I was staying | The service manager was waiting for me and the problem was solved | He called me to make sure everything was completed to my satisfaction | That is Cadillac quality and servuce |
