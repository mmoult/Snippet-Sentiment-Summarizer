REVIEWS
 "words": Love the car but I have a clunking noise coming from the rear of the car | Infiniti knows about this it's been with the M series since 2006 | They say its unfixable | WHAT | I am very displeased with the way Infiniti is handling this problem and plan to take it to the fullest if it should come to that | 
 "words": Traded in a 09 Maxima for the 08 Infiniti M45X | I test drove the 08 G37 and a 08 BMW 550 | The G 37 actually drives better but I figured I would get the top of the line and go with the M | The car does not turn heads but as the other reviewer put it you get pampered when you get inside | I had a Maxima prior to this so I understand all the gadgets | Everything is laid out well | It has great power you will not get embarrassed on the acceleration lane and on a smooth road you cant tell the difference between 65 and 85 | The surround sound is like a concert hall | Around town the ride is a little bouncy you will feel most bumps in the road and the M goes through gas | 
 "words": I traded in a 2009 Maxima for the 2008 M45X new | This is a very nice luxury vehicle | It has all the toys inside that the BMW 5 series has | The smart cruise control is awesome | This vehicle accelerates very quick | This car is a keeper | It is not a head turner | I think the goodies inside with all the electronic gadgets you get to play with is where you get your monies worth out of 2008 M45X | The surround sound is awesome | Pretty quiet ride not as smooth on rough roads as I was expecting | On the highway you cannot tell the difference between 75 and 90 mph | Simply a well built machine | I had buyers remorse initially but the car has won me over this car is a keeper | 
 "words": I purchased a 2008 M45 Sport in December | It was used with 3700 miles and includes the Sport Tech and Advanced Tech packages which are just about everything you'll need unless you are shuttling around some very special friends | The only thing it's missing is the reclining heated rear seats | boohoo | I looked at dozens of cars before finding this one at an incredible deal | Giving up a Porsche 911 I wanted power | check | I also wanted something luxurious | check | All without making me feel like I should be twice my age in order to drive it | that's where the Sport Pkg comes in | This car handles incredibly well for something this big and the acceleration nearly matches my 911 | 
 "words": I leased mine with a two year contract | At the end of the lease I am very happy with the car | It has good acceleration its comfortable and its stylish but not over the top | It doesn't attract too much attention but when I sit inside I feel pampered | Good features are ride and technology | Bad features are gas mileage and noise level | 
 "words": The 2008 M45x is one of the most luxurious and best handling sedans in this category | It may not be the best in every category but the combination of luxury performance and features is excellent | 
 "words": When I was shopping for a new car I checked out several in the price range of 50000-60000 | The Infiniti M45x beats all in this range | The car has great power and acceleration and a sporty stance | The exterior is not quite as aggressive as it could be but whatever the exterior lacks the interior quickly makes up for | The interior design layout and overall look is amazing | The ambient lighting is beautiful and the control console is like none other | The comfort is tremendous in this car and is spacier than almost any car in its class in this price range | Overall it is a beautiful car and does everything that I need it to | 
 "words": I am at the end of my 39 mo lease bought 2006 model on 10 30 05 love the car from day one | Perfectly comfortable inside and outside | Excellent nav system very useful rear view camera day or night especially for parking in tight places plenty of power | Overall 9 10 only because I know there is better cars out there which I have not tried yet | 
 "words": After thoroughly reviewing several cars from BMW 3 and 5 series Jaguar XF Mercedes C class Lexus IS F I settled upon the M45 sport almost fully loaded lacks mobile DVD system | Some of these cars are like comparing apples to oranges but the M45 above all others is best in overall value to performance | it has the best of all worlds | It offers great performance plenty of space excellent design and the best technology features of anyone | While all the other cars were always sorely lacking in some features for example the IS F lacks space the Jag lags in technology etc | the M45 simply glimmers best in everything overall and at a respectable price comparatively | 
 "words": I have the Sport model | Exciting car to drive with all the extras that a driver could desire | I don't find the control center confusing but rather find it loaded with useful features | I push the car hard on winding roads and I find it very responsive and easy to handle | It compares favorable to BMWs I owned in the past | The gas mileage is not good but that is the only disappointment especially when premium hit 4 | 00 in Santa Barbara | All together I highly reccomend this reasonable priced luxury sport sedan | 
 "words": I bought this after testing the 550i | outstanding performance | Handles like a sports car but rides like one 19wheels | Interior is quiet and serene at high speeds | I find myself regularly doing 100-120mph without even feeling it | Exhaust note is sweet | The best low beam headlights in any car I've driven the road is evenly carpeted with bright white light but strangely very lousy high beams | Leg room in the front and back is class leading
