 "words": Bought my Mini new in 2 08 and the fuel pump went out at 17000 miles | Although it was covered under warranty I can only guess what troubles lie ahead | I also had to replace one of the run flat tires to the tune of 249 | The car is fun to drive and I have adequate space since I no longer have young kids to transport | But once I experience a major mechanical failure I start looking for a new car | I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2 10 | 
 "words": I bought my car brand new a year ago have loved it despite quirks with the windows no fix for it yet | supposedly coming in late 2008 | Drove it responsibly for 14000 miles in the year to include a trip across country | Now the clutch is burnt and its not covered under the warranty | They are blaming me which is ridiculous | I would be wary of buying one again | 
 "words": I am very disappointed with the engine automatic transmission design | There is a very bad dead zone in the acceleration in 1st from a dead stop | The top squeals when coming up | The maintenance is free but when they don't fix anything it's worthless | The repair shop isn't familiar with the car and can't fix problems | I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed | They have even lied actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong | I would not recommend anyone buy this Car with an automatic | The rear view is cluttered and very dangerous to back up | The automation in the controls is stupid mostly unnecessary and very annoying
 "words": It's a fun car to drive great gas mileage cute etc but very expensive for repairs | In one year I've spent 2500 out of pocket on a car I bought brand new from the dealer in addition to the gas to get to the dealership 100 miles roundtrip in DC traffic and taking time off work they close at 7pm | 
 "words": My clutch went out at 14000 miles windows finicky don't work all the time | Re the clutch no explanation other than its my fault from Mini of North American and the dealer | I had to pay for the replacement less than a year after purchasing it | My previous clutches didn't burn out until 60000-75000 miles so I don't understand this but I won't buy another mini and will sell this one within the year | 
 "words": This is my second mini | The clutch went out in the first one after 2 1 years years and only 22000 miles | The cause was determined to be a manufacture defect and was covered | My 2008 Mini S has only 10727 miles and is a standard transmission too | The clutch began slipping on this one | It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to hear if the repairs are covered | I do not ride the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift that often not a lot of stop and go traffic | I have read many posts on other sites about mini's and clutch problems | Buyer be ware | 
 "words": I love my British racing green convertible | The sidewalk package has all the bells and whistles esp the gorgeous brown leather interior | Now they won't make it any more | I am disappointed I wanted a new one only because I think the rear window visibility would be much improved with the retractable roll bars | 
 "words": Had the car for little over a year now | It is an absolute BLAST to drive and will always put a smile on your face | Fuel economy is phenomenal for a car this fast as well | Lots of cool features like the folding mirrors that are more fun the show of than functional but fun either way | The pushbutton start is cool but I wish it had the comfort access system | The leatherette looks nice but I don't like the way it feels | All in all for 25550 and the included maintainance its a lot of fun for the money | 
 "words": This is my second burgundy Mini | My first was a 1967 that I brought back from Europe | Both cars were are go- carts | The '67 cornered better but was underpowered | The '08 has the power but it overpowers the steering | No complaints mine you | Lord what a fun car to drive | By the way the title refers to a carnival ride The Wild Maus | It would snap your head off your shoulders if you weren't careful | Read the complaints Bumpy ride It is a sports car dodge them | Limited space drop the back seats and think again | Odd radio controls It has a radio | who knew | I love to hear it purr |

 "words": So far my MINI is winner | As all other reviewers have commented on it's a blast to drive | Test drove the other subcompacts and MINI stood out from the pack | Cornering and handling are outstanding with no body roll | Braking is very responsive and fuel economy is excellent averaging about 31mpg combined | Getting 44mpg on the Hwy with a light foot in 6th gear | Styling is one of a kind | Base Cooper still nicely equipped without a lot of added options | Interior fit and finish is impressive | Ride is a bit firm but still in a fun kind of way although this can get tiring on long drives I must admit | Watch the road dips as this car sits low to the ground |

 "words": O | K | it's cute fit well in my garage and was truly fun to drive but the novelty for us was over for us in a big hurry | It is a very small car and while likely the best in its class we found it cramped noisey rattley and poor riding especially on road trips | The run-flat tires are bricks the premium stereo was fair at best it was nearly impossible to get comfortable nowe aren't big people and I really didn't care for the valve rattle at start-up on cold days | I switched to a Camry SE V6 which is yes faster more refined has far nicer more of everything and for about the same money | If you need to drive regularly long distances or with others don't buy a Cooper
