REVIEWS
 "words": I wrote about my car shortly after receiving it in 2007 | Here we are nearly two years later and I still love it | No mechanical problems at all | Gas mileage is still mediocre 25mpg at very best all highway driving more like 18 in the city | but understandable when there's so much power on tap | Seats continue to be completely supportive even after two years | Just wanted to chime in and say that the enthusiastic glow that so many of us feel right after buying a car has continued with this one | My favorite car I have ever owned and that includes a long string of Audis BMWs and various Japanese makes | No regrets whatever | 
 "words": I tested both GTI then the R32 on the same raod and same driving style | If it was not the price tag it will be a no brianer R32 is the one | I picked the R32 anyway | This car is super fun to drive | After getting used to the car and start pushing it I was shocked that how much a 33000 car can do | Especially on wet road this car car pretty much beat any moving object on the road | If you can totally master this car you can out run most of the higher power cars on the market even with the only 250bhp | I often play with my co-worker's BMW 335i as long as there are some turns he will has a hard time to catch up | The sweetest feature | Lanch Control | 
 "words": I bought my blue R32 with nav in April and drive 85 miles a day to work | This car is a great commuting car | fun to drive comfortable ride but a ton of torque at any speed | I have had an Audi S4 and S6 and neither is as fun as this car | The only two things that I have added to the car is a clear bra and a Parrot blue tooth system that integrates directly to to the phone button on the steering wheel | It works wonderfully with my iphone 3G | 
 "words": Buy this car | The build quality is in Audi territory | The interior is great steering wheel feels fantastic in hand | The car has grip for days the body might roll a bit but the AWD goes exactly where you want it | Not to mention one of the best shades of blue ever | And yes it is FAST | The mid range passing power is always right there | I drove both the STI and EVO they are both faster but that's the ONLY place they beat the R32 | Both the STI and EVO have interior build quality that suggests the occupants were only an after thought | 
 "words": This car wasn't even a consideration for me until a friend told me about it | I fell in love with the car on the test drive | It's comfortable on long drives and just a hoot zipping around the city | It's hard to drive the car easy so I'm not sure of the MPG yet | 
 "words": I have been wanting this car ever since it hit our shores at the end of 07 however I didn't want to pay sticker or more simply b c it was a limited edition vehicle | Ended up paying 29K for my new non nav R32 | I love the styling DSG all wheel drive grip of the Haldex 4motion system | This car really offers the best of the boy racer fun but yet the practicality of a 3 dr hatchback without all the hood scoops and large winged spoilers | The fuel economy is the only real negative | and it's not the 18 mpg in the city that bothers me its the short cruising range of 225 to 270 mls | the answer would have been a bigger tank | Otherwise no complaints | it's a great car that I would recommend | 
 "words": I was set on buying a GTI until i found a dealer that was selling their last 2 R32s for 4K below the list price including the VW rebate instead of 4K over like my local VW dealer | I ended up paying 29 | 3K without Nav | which is only about 3-4K more that an optioned up GTI | So far the car has lived up to its billing | The power is more than adequate for in town driving the handling is great and the exhaust note is pure magic | The gas mileage is even acceptable as long as you keep your foot out of it | It was the Reader's Reviews on Edmunds that convinced me to got for it and i have not been disappointed | 
 "words": Bought this R32 used with 12k miles | It is everything that I thought it would be | Solid build handling acceleration | DSG is surprisingly quick and responsive | 23 MPG mixed so far but am surprised at the amount of revs in top gear | This engine could easily handle a taller gear and would probably get better gas mileage | Unlike others I think this vehicle is exactly what it was made to be and should be | FUN The only thing I'm disappointed in is the IPOD adapter | 75 Harmon Kardon add on unit does a far better job | 
 "words": I paid too much for a Over Steroid GTI | Not a bad vehicle but not what I expected for the price | I only have 901 miles on it and it sits in the garage | When I do take it out I pray that someone will steal it or total it out | I can't even give away as a cheap trade in | Basically I did not do my homework | 
 "words": I too love this vehicle | It is sporty functional and fairly comfortable | However as some of you have mentioned I too have had this gas tank problem | My R32 was idling when it just started dumping multiple gallons of gas everywhere | The tank wasn't full and it came from the underside of the car | The VW people assure me that this problem was unique to my car | However all the parts are back ordered | The have had my car for almost 2 weeks and said it could be 2-3 weeks more | Sounds like VW needs to admit this design flaw | 
 "words": I have had my R32 for 4 days now | I had previously owned a 1995 Jetta VR6 | I knew what to expect with the power and performance | However I had no idea how smooth and precise the DSG was until my First Road Trip from Detroit to Atlanta 750 miles | I learned that S means See Ya later | I was comfortable and enjoy the drive | Unbelievable handling and acceleration | This vehicle is low key and stays under the Radar with police | I look forward to adding a Cool Air Intake in the coming weeks to help with gas mileage and possibly more |

 "words": Over the years I have owned or purchased a number of performance vehicles a short summary 1997 BMW M3 2001 BMW M Coupe 2003 Honda S2000 2006 Porsche Boxster S | I do have to say the R32 doesn't quite hit the handling and performance of some of these cars but it does something none of them could do with the exception of the 97 M3 and that is provide performance and practicality | It certainly beats the M3 in bad weather because of AWD but in pure head banging acceleration you won't get it with the R32 | What you will get is manners knowing that the car in under your control not the other way around which happens when people buy too much car for their capability | The R32 is great | 
 "words": Great car lots of power and the all wheel drive is very tight | Much better than my Porsche | It's worth the extra cash and has a great resale value |

 "words": Absolutely love my new R32 but a few things to know during test drives | Note that the door speakers do rattle with moderate to high bass music | Also there is a electric buzzing noise produced by the fuel pump coming from passenger side rear listen for it at idle | If you can get over those two and the 19 mpg fuel economy | this is a fun car | The note on the exhaust sounds similar to the BMW 330 at idle and M3 with full throttle | I got mine for 31995 with no Nav but I'm sure you could do much better | 
 "words": Just got the R32 and can't wait to drive it every morning | In the past I have owned a 2002 WRX and a 2004 STI | The WRX was a fun zippy car to drive and the STI was a very serious brute that has incredible performance but my passengers hated it always complaining about how uncomfortable it was | To me the R32 is the perfect blend of the two | This car is a pleasure | I enjoy every moment that I am in it | It is much more comfortable then the older Subarus and still has the performance edge that I require | The DSG transmission is as good as the hype and really makes this a practical and fun to drive car | For me this is the perfect everyday driver
