 "words": I used to have a '93 Toyota pickup 5 spd manual with the 22RE engine that I loved | Put 24k miles on my '08 so far and no major complaints | The SR5 4 | 0L V6 has more than ample power | Roomy interior | Gated automatic shift lever does not have locking button so that the lever can shift at anytime if it is accidentally bumped | The downshifts could be smoother and less often but aren't that big a deal | Wish I'd gotten the stick shift instead but at the time I wanted to try an automatic after 15 years of my old truck | Love the suicide rear doors on the access cab | But rear seating is cramped and should only be for short trips or kids |

 "words": I purchased this truck used with 15K on it | I traded in an 89 4runner w 200K 13 mpg | The primary reason for buying a small truck was the fuel economy | Fuel prices seem to be on the rise once again who knows what will happen in the years to come | I live in S | W | FL | and commute 20 miles each way a day | Mostly at 45 to 60 mph mixed city driving mostly | My first tank returned 25 | 8 MPG | I babied the truck trying to keep the RPM under 2K | I did spin it up when needed | You can get great fuel economy out of this truck and still be courteous to others | 
 "words": Owned a Tacoma extra cab previously | Bought quad cab site unseen- it's enormous | Toyota blew up Tacoma like a balloon | Love the power and room but feel like I'm driving a dump truck | 57 y o lady and it's much more truck than expected | Hear the vibration that others note | Drove the same model at dealer and vibration was worse than mine | Everything else is usual Toyota quality | 23mpg hwy-comfy roomy for husband me dog on long trips | We have trouble with visibility on right side | Gorgeous and feels very safe- would love to have had this when kids were young | Hope I get used to the size mammoth- not the Tacoma I'm used to | and hope to keep for many years as with other models we've owned | 
 "words": I bought my truck February of 08 | I have a factory-installed roof rack that leaked from the drivers side rail into the cabin with only 8000 mi that took 2 times to fix | My passenger floor board had to be re-welded because of squeaking noise that sounds like metals buckling whenever I drive over uneven pavements | Oh they have to remove my passenger side front door my steering wheel and my entire dashboard area just gain access to that one particular spot | My new car smell didn't last but a couple of months which was replaced by the aroma of a freshly welded metals which by the way lingered for more than 3 mos | I've owned 4 different Toyotas in the past | 08 Tacoma is a disappointment | 
 "words": I have driven my truck about 36000 miles in 10 monthsoutside sales w large territory | Power and handling are excellent for a truck | Mileage stays between 21 | 5 and 22 with mostly highway driving | Previously drove a Colorado for 150000 miles | Toyota power and quieter ride are a serious upgrade | Used to have to pull off the road in the Chevy to talk on the cell | 
 "words": This truck is a tank in mud and snow | Less than a week after we purchased it we took it out into the Owhyee Mountains | While crawling up hills though several inches of mud the Tacoma tracked very well where other much larger trucks had slid off the road and torn up the brush | My Tacoma has forded many streams and climbed over rocks without developing any problems | With lots of payload lbs and a truck bed I can fit all my gear including shovels and saws for winter camping in the truck plus my dog's crate in the back seat | It handles surprisingly well on highway better than my Subaru Forester | Over 16000 miles I've averaged 20 mpg in city highway and off-road miles | 
 "words": This is the first Toyota truck I have ever owned | I've only had it a few weeks but could not be happier | Plenty of power for passing and a very comfortable ride for a pick-up truck | The interior of the truck was set up very nicely with no gauges being blocked from your view with the steering wheel | I've seen several reviews from professional websites that claim the seating position is too low | I'm 6'2 and I say the seating position is too high | Other than that an overall exceptional truck | 
 "words": All around solid dependable truck | Daily driver 75 highway miles day | Average 20-22 MPG | Traded an '03 Dodge Dakota for it and what a difference | Not all good sadly | As some have said here the brakes are horrible and Toyota should be ashamed of them | The peppy 4 | 0L V6 makes the 3 | 9 in the Dakota seem like a 4 cylinder however with excellent torque and high end power | Ride is good | it's a truck after all | Much more comfortable than the Dodge and I love the dash control layout | Once I wear out the atrocious stock Dunlop tires and replace with something decent handling will be great | 
 "words": Great truck this is my 5 Toyota | But with the 6 speed manual the throttle does strange thing | When you are stopped the RPS are 900 when the truck is rolling and not in gear the RPM go up by them self to 1300 | When you are moving in gear and you let off the gas the throttle does not close very fast it feel like it closes part of the way then in 2 sec it shuts completely | All of this I think hurts the gas mileage 16-17 | May be the auto would be better | Yes the cd player need to play MP3s and the 4wd low in trick but when you learn to push the clutch first it is fine and the stock tires are low grip | One more thing the plastic bed is very slick | I still like this truck | 
 "words": First Toyota truck have driven Ford f150s all of my 52 years the brakes on the Tacoma seem to be some what weak should be disc on the rear and the transmission feels like it downshifts a little hard | Like the storage space and ground clearance | Like interior of the truck | Plan on keeping this truck a long time | 
 "words": I am having an issue with steering wheel vibration between 50 and 70 mph and it started that way off the lot 7 miles | Tires were replaced and alignment completed and still having vibrations | So far everything else working ok and mpg is 20 which is better than my other truck was | 
 "words": I owned a 2004 extended cab Prerunner prior to my 2008 4x4 | What a big difference | The 2008 turns tighter better u-turns | The ride is way better even with the TRD offroad package my 04 did not have | The 04 wandered all over the road the 08 stays centered better | Every gripe I had about the 04 seemed to be fixed by Toyota in the 08 | Don't get me wrong the 04 was a great truck with absolutly no mechanical issues in 38000 miles of use | I'm sure this 08 will be the same | I just wish I had opted for the top line stereo | Was told it was only available in sport package | This truck tows my 2200 lb boat effortlessly | For the price the towing package is a bargain for what you get | 
 "words": I bought the truck in Greenville SC | Moved 2 kayaks boating camping gear coolers etc | from our van into the truck at the dealership | My son and I headed off into the NC mountains in search of whitewater | The 4x4 system worked great | The truck had enough room for our 2 week trip | The double doors made the Access cab useful | The cab has great storage areas | 
 "words": This is my third Toyota | Although I have been sold on the overall quality of Toyota I am somewhat disappointed with my present truck | I get vibration in the steering wheel between 55 and 70 MPH | After three trips to the dealership and replacement of two tiresI still have the vibration | Now the metal framework in the seatback on the driver's side is coming out through the fabric | The A C fan motor would only work on high speed resistor replacement required | The transmission shifts rough the door speakers buzz when the bass is turned on step 5 volume is only at medium | My best gas mileage so far is 20 | 2 MPG hwy | Did I mention I only have 5200 miles since purchased new | 
 "words": I was starting a job and I knew I would be driving a lot of miles so I went with the Tacoma | I live in Northern California and like to go camping and snowboarding | I went with the TRD Sport 4x4 and it drives like a car | No body roll or jarring bounces like other trucks | Very smooth ride | I used to drive a Volvo which is notorious for having the most comfortable seats and the comfort factor is very similar in the Tacoma | It has tons of interior storage space and is very well laid out | I also installed a new exhaust system and it gave me an almost 20 increase in MPG | 17 to around 19 city and 19 to 2324 hwy | Overall incredibly pleased and would buy again | 
 "words": After 14000 miles the mileage 70 MPH is now up to 24 MPG | That's satisfactory for a 4x4 | Pickup is smooth and the bench seat okay on long trips | Don't care for the Dunlap tires | they're smooth but sure don't have the quality of Michelins | I added a factory cruise control and 2 factory 'D' ring tie-downs to the front of the bed | This little rascal ought to come stock or at least available with intermittent wipers cruise | It rides handles just fine | For a basic 4x4 under 20 Grand pickup I don't see how you can beat it | Tight no rattles easy to do maintenance pretty dog-gone good ride | I'm a bear to satisfy | and I'd buy this one again in a second | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle for about 9 months put 10600 miles on it so far | And just lost my clutch | Luckily my friend with a ram was following me and could tow me to a safe place | I'm disappointed | EXTREMELY | I had a rav4 before this which had the tranny drop in it | I just figured it was the luck of buying a used car | I bought new this time in hopes that it would be more dependable | not so much | I take long trips and take my truck off road | I can't be breaking down in the middle of no where when i don't have reception | I would suggest the tacoma | but good luck | 
 "words": I finally sold my '91 Toyota Pickup for a new Taco after failing to find a used 4 cyl manual 2wd extended cab one used for anywhere near a reasonable price | My old pickup was still getting 35 mpg highway when I sold it at 160000 miles | But the extra cab space and comfort is great | After almost a year with the new truck I really like this truck | With a camper cap on the bed and at 69 MPH I get a solid 30 MPG on trips | Around home I still get a respectable 25MPG although I drive with efficiency on my mind | Performance is adequate and the handling is mushy compared to my old Pickup but the ride is much better and the interior is much more comfortable | 
 "words": I looked around and it did not take me long to make a decision in buying this vehicle | I have encountered the same difficulty in clearing my leg from the steering wheel when entering the cabin but in general Toyota you have come a long way in design and performance in this category | Fuel mileage should improve | 
 "words": I have recently purchased '08 Prerunner TRD offroad 4 door and so far I love it | Just replaced a '04 Titan and have gone from about 10 mpg to 19 and kids have more room to boot | I live on a mountain and travel it as well as others everyday | Truck has plenty of power and is averaging 19 | 8 mpg | This is my first non 4x4 truck and hoping that the rear locking differential gets me out of those occasional mess ups | Have found that dry rocky conditions are no issue for this 2wd nor is steep lose gravel roads | Highly recommend this truck if you need to re-up on a truck and gas mileage important | 
 "words": Although a bit pricey the Tacoma offers reliability performance and is economical to operate for a truck | It pulls a load well within its capability although fuel mileage suffers with a loaded trailer | When I trade again I will opt for the longer bed for convenience | I get over 21 MPG with my Tacoma | Some of the increase might be attributable to having a cab high fiberglass topper and a cat-back TRD exhaust system along with a KN air filter | All in all it's a great truck | 
 "words": The 4-cyl 5-speed manual trans combo is well matched | When you get on it the power is very impressive | I am getting a consistent 24-27 | 5 MPG | Handled a large 7ft sofa and a tall chest of drawers with a hitch | The area below the dash and the steering column is small for people with large feet | Cabin is a bit noisy at highway speeds when crosswinds are strong | No frt tie-down d-rings as in the rear | HUGE BOO-BOO | The truck drives like a car for comfort on long trips | All the power accessories work well and are well designed | OEM spkrs chintzy | GREAT A C with very adjustable vents | Adjustable lumbar a great feature | Changed oil today easy just have a cap style filter wrench | 
 "words": I purchased my truck almost 9 months and 10000 miles ago and I must say that I am still very happy with it unlike my last pick-up truck a which was a 1999 Ford Ranger | I have driven it between Florida and Upstate New York a number of times and except for disappointing highway gas mileage around 18-20 MPG I generally have no complaints | I bought the truck without the towing package a 600 dealer option but I installed a top of the line trailer hitch and wiring for less than 200 | I had no problem towing a 5000 lb | boat trailer | I also didn't get the overpriced TRD option but the truck is still great off-road | 
 "words": I have owned dozens of vehicles including five 4x4 trucks | I've had Chevy Dodge Ford Jeep and Land Rover some new some not | My 2007 Tacoma 4x4 double cab beats them all hands down | By far the best stock 4x4 I have ever driven let alone owned | I highly recommend this truck as a primary vehicle especially if you like to take it out into the hills frequently like I do | I put a ToyTec 3 lift in front and 1 | 5 add a leaf in back | This truck rocks | 
 "words": This is my second Toyota Truck but have owned several Toyota's I was a Toyota Master Tech years ago | I bought with the SR5 package which is a MUST aluminum wheels and a factory hitch | If you want to buy the stripped version drive the SR5 first trust me | I installed a factory Toyota RS alarm also | This truck is the perfect size | My 1990 was a little small but this one is perfect | 
 "words": The fit and finish is not close to the Toyotas I have owned in the past | I have gap differences of more than 3 | 2mm side to side | The paint has a lot of orange peel | Toyota's position is that they are all the same and the Tacomas have textured paint since that is the type of paint they use | When was the last time you heard texture and car paint used in the same sentence | Make sure you check the fit and finish very carefully before you buy since Toyota will provide no help after the sale | 
 "words": I have been looking for a truck that can accommodate my family and my household items and I did find it | My toyota Prerunner is the one | I trade my old Toyota 1995 to the one I have now | Now I own the most reliable and valuable truck | It is the smartest move I have made this year | It is the best buy if anyone consider a truck for a special needs |

 "words": We've had this for 6 months now | Had a '90 truck so the size of this one put me off at first but I've adapted and my wife has to the creature comforts lacking in the '90 which is the main reason I HAD to get a new truck | We just finished a 1400 mile trip to the Eastern Sierras | A mix of freeway hills mountains and dirt roads | As others mentioned fifth is pretty weak to maintain freeway speeds on steep inclines so used 4th for that and everything was fine | As for mileage got 27 | 2mpg for the entire trip | Think we could beat that on an all freeway trip to LA | Unless you really think you need 4WD V6A T why haul all that extra weight around | At 4 | 25 a gallon it all adds up | 
 "words": I got this truck about a week ago after being on deployment in Afghanistan for around 7 months and am loving every second with it | It's fun to drive and surprisingly good on gas | It's a gorgeous truck and I have gotten many compliments on it | I got the TRD Sport Package and the added hood scoop gives the truck a tough offroad look | The 4 wheel drive is more than capable and it rides really well on the street | The included Bilstein Suspension makes potholes and bumps feel pretty much non existent | I don't think I could be more pleased with it and look forward to driving it for 10 or more years since of course it is a Toyota |

 "words": I moved up from my 03 Tacoma 2 | 4L engine for this one | This truck has all the bells and whistles my old truck lacked and I love it so far | Powerful V6 engine tighter turning radius than my smaller 03 Taco had smooth shifting automatic | It's very comfortable for me to drive although there seems to be a good amount of wind noise at freeway speeds | Around town it's quiet and seems to be rock solid so far | Keep in mind I only have about 175 miles so far but at this point I'm very happy with the truck |

 "words": This is my first Tacoma but I've been in love with this truck for years | It handles fine for me | it's just a truck not a sports car | Off-road the truck handles well and performs better but the stock tires need to go if you plan on doing some serious off-roading | Otherwise I've been averaging over 20 mpg doing mostly highway driving through the Cumberland mountains a 4spd automatic might have been a better choice since the 4cylinder needs to be in 4th gear to climb hills on the interstate | The base model comes with no frills but I can handle crank windows and push mirrors it's a truck plane and simple | 
 "words": There is no position on the heater AC controls that will shut off outside air from coming in through the vents which is a problem if you live in a colder climate as I do | The wind noise overpowers conversation and the radio the wipers make an irritating | thunk thunk | noise and the outside temp compass indicator is difficult enough to read due to a reflective glare | The seat bolsters are narrow and uncomfortable | Gas brake pedals are too close |

 "words": This is my second Tacoma and I find the quality of this vehicle far superior to any of the others that I have owned over the years | A solid built tough truck that is comfortable enough to take on a family vacation |
