REVIEWS
 "words": Overall I love the car | Ride is smooth power is more than adequate and handling is nimble | The beefed up Dynaudio Sound System is expensive but AWESOME | The design of the system lets you totally enjoy the stereo even with the top down | Just wish my model came with iPod Dock | Interior is very comfortable and quiet though not overly spacious | There's plenty to love here with a few minor annoyances no iDock the trunk cowl required to be snapped down before lowering the top could seat more securely some don't like the back massage given by the big subwoofers behind the back seats BLIS trips out occasionally | 
 "words": I just discovered that this car has no spare tire | I was never informed it was an option | Who ever heard of such a thing | And Volvo is supposed to be so safety conscious | The interior storage space is terrible | Not even a road map fits in any of the side pockets | Is a cell phone supposed to fit in that little well on the seat divider | Whose | 
 "words": We've owned our Volvo C70 for 18 months and so far no problems | Quality build and fit is excellent | Car rides a little harsh but that is due to the 18 performance tires which wear out rather quickly 300 a pop to replace | We get a lot of positive comments on the sharp looks | Have one major gripe | That is the navigation system is a real Dinosaur to operate | The Japanese beat the Swedes in the electronic software department again | 
 "words": I chose the C70 over an Audi due to the hardtop | I have had it in the shop seven times and 90 days since May '08 for roof issues | Fortunately none of them have been major but a major inconvenience on my time | My biggest problem has been getting anyone from Volvo corporate to give me a call to discuss some kind of resolution | 
 "words": My husband and I purchased the C70 after doing extensive research over the last year | We owned a soft top Sebring Convertible and loved it but were considering a retractable hard top | We bounced back and forth between the C70 and the S60 with a sunroof | We admired the Volvo C70 the first time we saw it while on vacation but were not sure we wanted to pay the high dollar amount | The mechanics of the hard top were a concern and while it makes this car very heavy the safety features are a huge plus | Although after selling our Sebring and missing the convertible for a week it was decided that the C70 would be the choice | This car is incredibly sleek comfortable and tremendously fun | 
 "words": I saw the car at the 2006 New York auto show and fell in love with it | The lines on the car are beautiful with the top up or down | The ride is good and its quiet inside | The interior is a little on the plain side when compared to other luxury brands | The front wheel drive is great in order to cope with New York winters | I would not even consider a rear wheel drive car | 
 "words": I always wanted a convertible but steered clear of soft tops loved the old C70 but only would have purchased a hard top | When I saw online Volvo building a new hardtop convertible I had to have it though I also steer clear of new models their first year or two due to the manufacturer working out the bugs | Having had two BMWs prior I struggled with not getting another one but am thrilled with my decision | This car even got a round of applause at a local eatery when I put the top down for the drive home | I also own an XC90 SUV both cars are white so a neighbor asked me if I work for Volvo now | I would highly recommend a Volvo | 
 "words": A little less sporty for a convertible | Would help to have more horse power | Bluetooth should be a 'must have' especially in CA | 
 "words": I could not be more satisfied with my new 2008 C70 convertible | As an owner of a 2000 C70 bought new and driven over 100k miles I initially though I would select something different | I shopped the competition for convertibles and test drove many below and above the C70's price point | I concluded the C70 was clearly the best value for me based on quality style and fuel efficiency | The C70 is not inexpensive but the more expensive 328i and CLK350 could not justify their higher prices | I have now driven the car for two months | All my expectations have been satisfied | Great qulaity and value | 
 "words": I test drove other cars in the same class | Audi convertible Lexus Mercedes etc | None I say none of them felt as solid had the same pick up were as stylish comfortable or as beautiful | What an great experience to drive this car AND it isn't bad to have so many people take an extra look as you drive by | Everything is within very easy reach inside even visibility is great | Although I prefer all wheel drive the C 70's front wheel drive works well | I have about 4000 miles on it presently and I am getting an average of 20 mpg and I have a heavy foot | I am an oldster and it is a pleasure to get that I love my car feeling back | Top up or down draws a crowd | 
 "words": I love my C70 but it is not the quality product I expected | Since purchasing it new I have attempted resolution of a leaking top and windows with no success | Thus far they have replaced both rear side windows and all the seals | It continues to leak | I only hand wash it with a mild stream of water from garden hose | The leaks persist | I am totally frustrated and am preparing to take this to the media | The local dealership and Volvo will not get my repeat business nor referral | 
 "words": The C70 is a beautiful car | The only problem that I have had is that I can't take my car through a car wash | It leaks inside my car | Now this would not shock me too much if I had a cloth top | I have the hard top | I took it to the dealer 2 times and also reported it to corporate | After they tested my car they agreed it did leak while in the car wash | There recommendation was that I can either hand wash my car or drive it to their dealership and take it through their light carwash | Would not mind if I didn't have to drive 25 minutes to get there and being that my car is leased this would be extra miles which I prefer not to put on my car | Volvo does not stand by product | Sad | 
 "words": I looked at all the convertibles | This car is 10000 less than the BMW 335i but has much better safetyrear leg room and I think exterior styling | The engine is smaller than the BMW but is more than adequate for driving anywhere but the autobaun | I have had strangers come up and ask me to put the top up or down | It turns heads in parking lots | This is pure fun and large enough to truly seat 4 people | I get 19-20 MPG around town | 
 "words": Bought the car from the distribution center | Came to me with no squeaks rattles etc | Has so far been a flawless experience contrasted with my 2005 and 2002 CLK cabriolets which were both problem-prone | 
 "words": Ok I've looked at BMW Mercedes Lexus and all other convertibles | This is the best blend of top down | Fun to drive fuel economy and good looks out there | I'm a rather large person 6'5 close to 300 lbs k with rather large feet | I found the spacing on the manual 6 a little too close but the auto 5 is great | Besides I don't drive F-1 so all of that shifting may or may not be necessary | The fit and finish are great | Love the seats the lines and the admiration of others | white car light leather interior and tinted windows Mid-life crisis with no direct link | Looked at a red one but liked the white better | Could use possibly a more higher profile tire Texas roads
 "words": Just bought my C70 through the special deal Costco and Volvo have | Great deal on a fun to drive car | This car turns heads | Love the roof the dynaudio and the back up warning since the rear view is somewhat limited | Has a decent sized trunk versus the Beemer 335 which a trunk the size of a shoe box | If you are a Costco member you can't go wrong on this one | I can't wipe the smile off my face | 
 "words": Bought the car on the overseas purchase program | Saved 8 and got a free vacation | Volvo people in Sweden are great and we drove 900 miles while there | Six speed manual is a dream | Side warning system is great for blind spots | Plenty of pep with manual transmission good road stability and quiet with hard- top up | Dynasound a must for CD's and Ipod | Some understeer but mostly a good solid ride | 29MPG in Sweden but gas is 95 octane and 8 | 25 a gallon | Does well on mid grade in USA mileage on cruise control at 70MPH is 28MPG | City is about 26MPG | Very comfortable and smoth | My wife loves the car | We traded a 2004 BMW 325CI and I like this car better | So far so good | No mechanical problems
 "words": Looked at convertibles for 2 years before settling on the C-70 | Decided on C-70 because of feel of quality and safety rating | Very well designed car | Smooth quiet excellent acceleration and handling | Gas mileage has been pretty good at 23 mpg in mixed driving | Optional bluetooth system worth the 675 dollars | I like the BLIS and Dynaudio | 
 "words": Did a lot of research on convertibles before I bought this one | In general I think it is a very functional and stylish car | Good driving position and room for the kids | I have had to take it to the dealer 4 times to get rid of the intermittent annoying rattle in the center front of roof and between the front and back right windows | Seems to be a very difficult thing to diagnose and fix | Hopefully we are getting to the end of the issue | Once resolved I will love the car | 
 "words": This was the first vehicle I test drove when I started car shopping after no less than 10 vehicles later I returned to buy this awesome car | A practical indulgence a hardtop sedan when the weather is bad and a convertible when the sun is out | Mine is all but totally loaded with the exception of a navigation system ultra-prem leather which seems nearly impossible to find I couldn't be more thrilled | With 2 hours in daily commute time the ride is luxurious and fun to the point I don't want to leave the vehicle | All I can say is that if you see one on a Volvo lot snap it up ASAP you won't regret it | Safety style and fun all rolled up into one great vehicle | 
 "words": This is a phenomenal car | Fun to drive safest car available spacious backseat and trunk | The whole experience was pleasurable | 
 "words": After driving the competition the 2008 C70 was a no brainer | Lots of power beautiful design in and out the best seats ever even by Volvo standards and best of all I can have two car seats in the back infant and forward facing with lots of room to spare | I got the upgraded sound system which is amazing and worth every dollar the climate package which keeps me warm in the morning and free Sirius radio for 6 months | What will amaze you is how big the trunk is with and without the roof in it how smooth the transmission is how elegant the interior is and how many storage compartments they put in this car | Bravo Volvo | 
 "words": After test driving the BMW convertible this Volvo became an easy choice | Better looks perfect sound system please get the upgrade and best of all has more airbags than I can count | The seats are very comfortable the interior is nice and easy to use buttons I also got the Climate package 6 mo free Sirius 1 year free maintenance and best of all 10K of the sticker price | All I need now is some sun | Enjoy your purchase | 
 "words": This is a fun vehicle and very fun to drive | What originally caught my eye was the sleeker design in contrast to the other Volvo models | The hard top convertable is also an excellent plus | Like Mc Donalds dah dup dah dah daaaaaah I'm lovin' it | 
 "words": I have only had this car a few weeks and it has exceeded my expectations Fun to drive love the hard top convertible | It won't mess your hair | I upgraded the sound to the dyna system and I was literally blown away I have owned BMWs Audi and Acura | This is the most fun I have had | I hope I am as thrilled a year from now | Only complaint is not enough accessory outlets one for my gps and one for my cell | They have to share |
