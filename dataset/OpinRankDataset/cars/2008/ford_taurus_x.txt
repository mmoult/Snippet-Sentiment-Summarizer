REVIEWS
 "words": I currently have one for a company vehicle | Almost 70000 in 2 years | Vehicle has plenty of power to pull out on busy streets interior is nicely laid outI have auto climate control | No SYNC on earlier model | Decent fuel economy for such a larger vehicle | Styling is nice even after 70000 miles its still nice to look at | Fiew issues CHECK YOUR HOOD | Corrosion on the hoods is a MAJOR issue | I have seen over half with corrosion issues | OEM tires are Terrible | I am currently on my third set went with GoodYear Integrity tires now | Better ride better wear | Poor manufacturing standards | Doors don't exactly line up hood offset etc | Front brakes wear prematurely | 
 "words": We replaced or 2005 Dodge Durango with the T Rex in April of 2008 | we have loved it ever since | It has done nothing but impress us and our neihbors since we got it and we continue to get comments on its classy styling which several people have mistaken it for an Audi station wagon | The 3 | 5L V6 is more than adequate for the Taurus X and it accelerates strongly and has plenty of reserve power | The interior is made of high quality plastics and the transmission shifts very smoothly | Overall it is a very impressive vehicle for the price and am very happy we chose this over the Volvo V70 | 
 "words": Having always driven small cars I wanted to step up to something larger but didn't want a mammoth SUV | I bought my limited in May of 2009 and am still in love with it | The Sync is awesome | Interior is roomy and comfortable and everyone raves over it | My 8 year old step daughter loves her DVD player and we love the wireless headphones | Cargo area is great and completely flexible | Very comfortable on road trips | Fuel economy averages around 25-26 on interstate and about 22-23 in town | 
 "words": Purchased this lovely vehicle about a month ago | However we have now discovered that two valves are leaking and the rotors need repair 18000 mi | I find it interesting that these were not repaired by the original selling dealership and we must now have it repaired under warranty by a Ford dealership | AND it is taking way too long for repair 3 day repair time | Without even an offer for a loaner | What kind of customer service is that | 
 "words": Mileage has risen from 13 to 16 for primarily city driving with 1100 mi | on odometer | I'm hopeful that when we drive 400miles roundtrip on highway soon it will rise further | No negative issues have cropped up but I have now noticed some rather cheap finishing on exterior trim | Other than those two things I'm still very happy with it | 
 "words": I have had this one for just over a year now | It kept stalling at low speeds | The dealer kept saying it was a calibration issue | We took it in 3 times for it to be properly calibrated | The Continental Touring tires that came OEM are bald at 14000 miles | They only come with a 12 month 12000 mile warranty and trust me | they won't last much longer than that | I would think after paying this much for a car that I could get some better OEM tires that I wouldn't have to replace in one year | The transmission is just plain goofy | It jumps all over the place at the wrong times | The front bumper is starting to come off | Dealer doesn't know why but will try to fix it | Overall the car is just | OK
 "words": We sold a wonderful Saab wagon because we needed more room after the birth of our second child | Having never owned a domestic car we were reluctant to even consider the Taurus X but the specs interior room decent fuel economy safety were compelling particularly at this price point | After living with it admittedly a short time I am blown away | It's solid as a rock with great build quality a very spacious interior w o being huge outside good ride handling balance amazing seating flexibilty | Leather quality is outstanding and there are numerous thoughtful touches such as the covered storage bin atop the dash | Not as much fun to drive as the Saab turbo but we're thrilled | 
 "words": With our last child in college we were looking for something besides a minivan with decent cargo space | I stumbled onto a review for the Taurus X in Consumer Reports 2009 car issue and was impressed with what I read | Other CUVs and SUVs were either too small and or too expensive | It had all the features I was looking for comfortable reclining rear seats and safety | The reported mpg was about the same as our old minivan | I can't speak to mpg yet as I've only had it a week and I'm sure it will take a little time to break in | It drives like a dream and feels like a tank | 
 "words": I traded in an Outback for a 2008 w 14500 miles | Though exterior styling is bland this doesn't have too be a bad thing everything else about this car is great | It handles well with good power | The interior is very sharp and the third row seating is actually usable and accessible | I consider AWD a must for Wisconsin winters and the seats fold easily for tins of space | there is even enough room for a decent amount of stuff with the seats up | 
 "words": Owned a Honda Pilot and the Taurus X by far is a better vehicle | Ride interior quality and fuel economy is good | the all wheel drive is great | 
 "words": Overall we are VERY please with this Ford | We believe we got alot for our money | It drives as nice as many luxury cars and can haul more than most pick up trucks | Luv Mult-sync works very well | Ford should promote this vehicle more | 
 "words": I have had people ask about the car | What is it | Who makes it | Ford | Is it a wagon | is it a suv | is it a crossover | I say yes | This has the best of all three | Space for 6 good styling strong V6 | Rides really good | not spongy like a minivan and not rough like a full size suv | It's small enough to be a grocery getter yet big enough to fit a new dishwasher with out needing to remove the car seats | This wagon crossover suv has a lot to offer | You must check this one out | It has fit all my needs wants | 
 "words": I swore I would never be an MM a Minivan Mom | This vehicle kinda looks like a station wagon | Not a big fan but the chrome helps | I own a 2000 Ford Taurus sedan | I was set on buying another one until I saw the Taurus-X | 2 problems so far | The first is the knocking sound that comes from the engine | I've been told that this is normal | The second is the manual latches on the seats | I've had nothing but problems w the 2nd row driver side | It is very difficult to release and does not operate properly | They have not fixed or replaced the seat | I think they are waiting for my warrantly to run out | Other owners have had the same issues | I'm hoping enough people will complain to prompt a recall | 
 "words": We are still new to this car but so far loving it | We are impressed with the versality as well as the comfort of the ride | Accelerates very quickly and you don't feel how fast you are going | 
 "words": I routinely buy or lease a new car every three years | I have had a lot of cars over the years | The Ford Taurus X is my favorite so far | The ride is smooth the handling and braking exceed my expectations and it is so comfortable | 
 "words": I've only had it a couple of days but I am really happy I purchased it | Holds my kids and all our junk | Comfortable seats and driving position | Enough power for passing | Much quieter than 04 CR-V and 98 Camry | Haven't used SYNC yet but will soon | I'm adding a trailer hitch for light towing Only rated for 2000lbs | Good looking interior | First American car I've ever had owned VW Honda Nissan Mazda and Toyota | I hope it hold up well | 
 "words": I heard the Taurus was back | It is one sweet ride | The engine has good power the ride is comfortable | A bit heavy on fuel but it is a heavy vehicle | One pet peeve The keypad mastercode is NOT user changable | It is permanent | Protect this code or one may face a security risk | Even if you program another code the master code still works | Thieves may not be able to steal your car but can steal what ever is inside | Ford needs to make the mastercode user changable and resetable in the event one forgets the programmed master code | You can change the module to get another code but it costs around 700 cdn | 
 "words": Have had the vehicle for two weeks | I regularly transport 5 passengers so a 6-seater was a must | Impressed with the leg room in all seats and my kids love all of the compartments to put their stuff | It has 12 cup holders | The third row is easily accessible with a kid-friendly pop-up middle seat | This was an improvement over other makes we looked at | From a driver's standpoint I am having trouble getting used to a middle console | I miss the floor space in my minivan | I also do not care for the steering wheel | It doesn't adjust very much | I do love the adjustable gas pedal and brake pedal | This keeps me from having to sit so close to the steering wheel making the airbag safer | 
 "words": I really like my crossover | It has space safety and looks | Very smooth drive and excellent for the kids | All I need now is a DVD to complete the package | 
 "words": The vehicle is very practical in all situations | I am a part time coach and need the room because it is hard to estimate how many players I need to get to and from the games including their equipment | I have the 7 passenger seating | The fold down seats make it a breeze for all seating cargo possibilities | Plenty of power even fully loaded the AWD is has never let us down even in a raging blizzard of snow and ice | Terrific road manners SYNC provides the kids the opportunity to use MP3 players so that I can concentrate on the road and not having to find appropriate radio stations | 
 "words": We purchased a used 2008 X Eddie AWD for a song | I guess Ford's poor decision not to market this car is a big plus for the pre-owned market | My wife loves it period | Other than the noisy Perelli tires the car drives great | It is far and away a much better and versatile car than the 05 Murano it replaced | 
 "words": Traded in the 2007 Expedition for the Taurus X | Felt like we needed better gas mileage | We did experience paying less at the pump for obvious reasons | With only 5900 miles on the car however the engine has now been torn apart twice with 9 parts being replaced including the gaskets valves and the housing | Initial indications were a timing issue around a phaser | Seven and a half weeks later and two car payments for air the car is finally fixed | We will see what the future brings | probably a Toyota | 
 "words": Our beloved and generally reliable '99 Dodge Grand Caravan had 135K mi and was beginning to worry us on road trips | I had been aware of this Ford design since it debuted as the '05 Freestyle | Found a pristine '08 19K mi at the dealer test-drove it several times and finally bought it | It's hard to imagine a more versatile daily driver RAV4 and CRV maybe | What is just amazing to me is how incompetently Ford marketed and advertised this vehicle | We've received nothing but compliments and admiring questions from total strangers and they invariably say Never heard of it | Sadly Ford is killing production in Feb 2009 after only two model years | This is tragic and stupid | 
 "words": Owned a Taurus sadan for 10 years looked for replacement found X love it | We have had it just over a year and wouldn't have changed it | When it is clean it sparkles Black shows everything We added a tow hitch and it is great to tow small trailer for vacations | We have owned a Ford for the past 20 years and will continue it quality continues | Gas mileage runs about 21-24 mpg with living in a rual area | 
 "words": I went looking for a van but found this Taurus X with 8000 miles on the lot | After driving it I bought it | The second row seats are an easier height to get into than a van but I miss the armrests as my Taurus X doesn't have them | I was told mileage would be 25-30 on highway but I don't get that good | About 23 | 3 catches me most of the time as I live in a rural area and do small-town driving plus some highway | I have only driven about 4000 miles so far and have had no problems | 
 "words": It is an awsome car with seating capacity for seven and performance of a sports car | It really feels like 300 hp under the hood and everybody believes it must have a turbo | Mine is loaded and everbody is empressed with from Sync to the nav system and satellite radio | The Eddie Bauer comes in two tone and has a distictive look | I love the car but one has to understand that with all this it is not going to get 30 miles to the gallon I am seeing what they say around 24 on the road | I find the car very comfortable and handling is a crisp and with sports like suspension | These are truely nicely engineered cars and I can find nothing that I don't like | 
 "words": Fantastic car | My wife and I drive it and love it | Very comfortable ride and very quiet | If I stay off the pedal the mileage ain't too bad | 
 "words": Purchased our X a month ago | Loved it on the test drive but now even more so | We traded a 2004 Mountaineer AWD V8 which we enjoyed quite a bit but was heavy on gas it avg | 14 | 8 mpg winter 16 | 5 mpg summer | We're averaging 21 | 4 mpg with the X | Straight highway driving the X gets 26 mpg and it's very spirited | There are a lot more storage bins and cup holders and getting to the rear seat is very easy | Love the way the seats fold down | Ford has a winner here and I do hope they continue to make this model | But Ford also has winners with the Edge and Flex | My feeling is the Taurus X is much better looking than the other two | 
 "words": I am a longtime Ford buyer but throughly shopped all the available crossovers | Import nation wake up | I have had 5 Fords now for well over a total of over 300k miles and nary anything ever to fix including my 06 500 | So I knew this vehicle would be top notch in terms of reliability | When I got my 500 I passed on the Freestyle because it lacked power but I loved the package | The new v6 and 6 speed makes up for that sin | Smooth powerful | This is one of the very few crossovers that drives like a sedan | Steering feel and ride is dead on | All seating is comfortable and firm | Ergonomics are spot on | Controls are easy to use | Vehicle feels like billet on the road | Your search ends here | 
 "words": Owned the T-X for almost three months and it is a great crossover | I bought it for my growing family and it does its job perfectly | Runs very quiet and handling is like a car which is much better than a minivan | However the interior space is much less than a minivan | 6 speed transmission is very smooth | Have 2500miles on it and got 2122 mixed average MPG | Tested highway MPG is about 28 at 70MPH | 3rd leg room is among the best | Unless you need minivan space otherwise this is a great family vehicle | 
 "words": I traded a 2005 Freestyle for this program 2008 Taurus X and other than the gas mileage being worse the car is much improved the ride is so much better and to me that more than offsets the difference in the gas mileage | Have taken one trip in it so far and it was without any flaws ran very well on the interstate and back roads | Only thing I really dont like about it is the price it will cost me to replace the tires they are very expensive | 
 "words": I recently purchased about the most basic Taurus X with 7 seats | I am amazed at all the features that are standard | Every safety feature I know of is standard and the highest crash test rating | I think these are important to all families with children | I don't feel I need any other features | Car is very comfortable and spacious | I recently went on a 5 hour trip with 4 adults and 2 kids in car seats | Packed the car full but enough room all and plenty comfortable | Should be room enough for 6 person family with luggage | Having 7 seats is also useful around town | This was the best vehicle SUV Minivan Crossover for the money | Paid just over 22k for all I needed and more | 
 "words": I use this vehicle for business it is licensed as a truck Having driven Econoline vans for the last 30 years I was looking for something that could haul every thing I needed and get better mileage | The Taurus X does everything I was hoping for and more | It's fun to drive with more than enough power and superb steering and handling | The mileage is better than I expected 23 overall and 29-31 on the highway cruise control set at 60 | I opted for the cloth seats and put sheepskin covers on them- I find them to be as comfortable as my Mercedes | Putting everything you need as standard as opposed to options and locating the controls where they are intuitive to operate is great | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle without even test driving it or looking at it | I was overseas and had no choice | I was a little worried about buying it without even a glance at it but I am totally happy | We drove it from Florida to California with a family of 5 | It was a great ride and we absolutely love our car | I was very impressed with the look and feel of it | Great family car | 
 "words": All I can say is wow | What a great CUV but why doesn't Ford market it more | Although at first I was a bit bummed when the wife said she would rather have the Taurus X than the AWD Limited Edge we both really loved I am happy to say that I am very glad I bought her a Taurus X | So far this is one fine CUV | The day after we got it we took it up north with 3 other people and stuff for the 5 of us and still had plenty of room | The only thing I regret not getting is the DVD Nav | system | So far avg 18 | 5 city and 24hwy MPG | Very pleased considering it has less that 1k miles on it
 "words": Does Ford even know this vehicle exists | Solid performer found by accident | No marketing on a decent family vehicle | 08 Taurus X FWD SEL | Recent family vacation 2 adults 4 crazy kids and way to much luggage | The true test of this vehicle's function | Strong drive train performance no problems on steep grades at all | Fuel averaged about 25mpg highway | Interior was comfortable and held up well | 3rd row two medium sized kids 12hr ride no complaints | Overall decent vehicle | Ford could have a winner here but guess they will drop it for the new Flex | 
 "words": We just made a 2100 mile trip with sun rain and wind on steep winding roads | The handling was great with the AWD | Easy and comfortable to drive in town and on the interstate | 
 "words": With the family expanding we needed to add some space | After driving mini-vans and other large SUVs CUVs the Taurus X was a great alternative | It feels like a much smaller vehicle than it actually is | Visibility is great as you sit higher than a sedan or wagon but the center of balance is still low enough so stability and handling are good | The Taurus X is quiet which is great for babies naps and coversations | Sync and the built in DVD are awesome | 
 "words": Chose Taurus X because it is IIHS Top Safety Pick 2007 2008 and has better space for the 2nd 3rd seats and it's much cheaper after rebates | Very good ride | Excellent crossover | 
 "words": Just three weeks and 1200 miles into our journey with the 2008 Taurus X | First this is far better vehicle than last Taurus I drove | This Taurus comes equipped with confident steering and a much improve ride and enough cup holders for three families | Ride and feel are improved fit and finish is generally very good | The all wheel drive will be welcomed when the weather changes and much to my surprise we averaged almost 25 MPG on a quick road trip covering 600 miles | First impressions are important and so far we like the Taurus X so much we | ve got to give it an A | So chalk one up for the blue oval guys they | ve made a good first impression with the Taurus X | 
 "words": We looked everywhere for a car that got decent gas mileage and held lots of car seats | This is the only crossover or SUV on the market with the lower anchors in the third row | For that matter there are only 2 mini vans that have lower anchors in the third row | I love the safety features and the car is easy in and out | As far as the gas mileage on highway trips it's great on many short little runs to the pool etc | not so great | We got this more for long trips with our little babies and our dog | Also the price we got the SEL it came nicely equipped in a very affordable range | It allowed our young one income home to have a new car that would fit everone | 
 "words": First of all Ford Motor Co | why are you keeping this vehicle under wraps | It is fantastic | I drove the Edge and while it's a nice car as an aging baby boomer the Taurus X was easier on my bad back and knee | I love everything about this car | The ride the performance the ease of positioning the seats so the car can be a heavy duty utility carrier | I love the interior and exterior design and keep getting plenty of inquiries and compliments | I enjoy SYNC and I love my navigation system which makes life a lot easier | Taurus X is a make over of the Freestyle | With its bigger engine and 6 shift transmission it's a sure winner and I highly recommend it | Congrats to Ford | 
 "words": I have stayed away from American cars for the last 20 years | This car changed my mind after six test drives at 6 different dealers | I could not belive this was a Ford | It's not the best looking car on the road but it sure does it's job | I have 3 big kids | One of which is 6 ft 5 | He fits | Plus we still have room for our stuff | Plus we can take a friend and still fit | The ride is really nice and it has just enough power to move us a a decent speed | I was more than pleasantly surprised with the standard options | The price was fantastic and it feels like it's a well built car | No rattles the doors close nicely then engine sounds good | I can't belive this is a Ford | 
 "words": This car is everything I was looking for I love it | Shortly after buying it I went on a trip and noticed a burning electrical smell turned out the passenger side mirror mirror frame rippled and melted | Got it fixed under warranty when I got home | 2 months later it happened again | This time they took pics and sent them to Ford | While awaiting the outcome the drivers side mirror started to do the same thing | Ford will not fix it | They say it's vandalism | After hours on the phone and sleepless nights I've gotten nowhere | I've taken it to an independent body shop and they are positive that something is overheating on the inside and causing the problem | Next step is Consumer Protection | 
 "words": My wife and I needed a vehicle that offers great amount of space but still remains practical | After two weeks of looking we saw the light | The Taurus X limited | This vehicle offers great space performance and looks | Gas mileage isn't bad considering the amount of cargo this can carry | We also like the fact that it is not the big bulky SUV that is hard to park or fit into the average parking spot | All in all the great thing about the Taurus X is the amount of standard features that are included | Wow | Lets just say for the competition they are just base models for the price we paid | Great bang for the buck | Thanks Ford | 
 "words": I really like this vehicle it drives like a car has room for 6 adults | The kids really like their heated seats and 2nd row center console and I really like the Sync and power liftgate | The AWD system is seamless really the only indication that it is working is the fact that you are accelerating effortlessly in heavy snow when everyone else is spinning | This vehicle is an ideal blend of car mini van wagon and SUV | I highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": We wanted a car to replace our old Villager that was more sedan than minivan but w more seating than a SUV the answer was the Taurus X | 3rd row seats are real and fits our family of 5 perfectly with lots of room for the gear ski scuba camping etc for the long haul Mammoth Lake Tahoe etc | The new engine is smooth and does not hesitate | Good mpg for the type of car beats 8-12 for most SUVs |

 "words": I had a 2006 Ford Freestyle and loved it but after about 35000 miles the CVT transmission started acting up | I had it fixed but I didn't trust it anymore | so I traded it in on the new Taurus X and I'm now in heaven | This car is even better than the Freestyle with new improvements like the better horsepower 6 speed transmission on the AWD heated seats in the back easier access to the third row seats better styling and many other improvements | This car is my personal space for long drives to my cottage or any other excuse to drive somewhere | The sound system and navigational system is great and the comfort is the best for my bad back | I've tried Mazda Cadillac and Taurus X wins | 
 "words": We bought this car to replace our 04 Tribute | It gets marginally less gas mileage about 22 overall vs 25 for the Mazda | But it has much more room is much more comfortable rides more smoothly and carries more cargo passengers | It all a hit a palpable hit | Like other raters I wish mileage were better but this is a large vehicle rather boxy with a big engine | If you need 30 mpg get a smaller car | or wait for the hybrid | 
 "words": We purchased our Taurus X last month and immediately loved it | We took a 500 mile round trip and received many compliments along the way | Kids love the interior especially the third row | Comfortable ride roomy and peppy | Would have liked the DVD option but couldn't find one in a low optioned SEL model available on a dealer's lot | Gas mileage is in the low 20's for combined driving currently but I anticipate that it will get better in the summer after the engine is broken in | 
 "words": I orginally was looking at the Ford Edge | I saw the Taurus X and was very impressed | After a test ride and long hours of research I decided on the Taurus X | Fun to drive quiet and completely comfortable | Handles fantastic | Performance is amazing | The seating designed really sold me | The 2nd row bucket seats are amazing | Every crossover should have these seats | I was never a Ford person but I love my new Taurus X | Ford needs to get it to the public lots more advertising and it will be a great seller | This is a quality American made car | 
 "words": We chose this car because it has an easily accessible third row of seats | Even my mom could operate them | Plus the seats in the third row fold down easily and give a lot of cargo room | An aside we purchased the WeatherTech mats and a cargo area mat and have been very pleased with them it's very muddy where we live | As for build quality it's decent | The doors always look open | The ride is smooth and merging onto busy fast roads is no big deal | Handling is proficient | Other makes might have a better finish but I wasn't willing to spend another 10-15K to get the same car with a flashier hood ornament | In all I would highly recommend this car | 
 "words": I have never owned a Ford product before but was drawn to the safety features and interior room Very roomy for kids and gear | I think this car has a lot of Volvo in it but at a Ford price | Car feels very luxurious and solid on the road too | I don't understand why Ford is not promoting this car more-it's a bargain given the features it has | 
 "words": We purchased this vehicle after our 2005 Ford Freestyle lease was up | The Taurus X is the Freestyle with a lot of improvements | After 4 months of driving it I am very pleased with our purchase | I thought I would miss the smoothness of the Freestyle's CVT but I don't miss it at all | The Taurus X's transmission is very smooth the ride is very quiet and the engine is very peppy | 
 "words": We have 2500 miles on the X and it is so much fun to drive | We are Grandparents My wife thinks I disguised the 2003 Cobra we traded in on the X as it is Very Quick | Mileage is 24 now but will get better as 30000 miles roles up | Road holding ability is super and no effort needed to drive | We use the rear part for hauling and it has more room than you think | All in all we think we are going to be very happy with our X
 "words": The Taurus X was an instant wow | Luxurious ride refined interior exclusion of road noise | You can't hear someone standing outside of the vehicle talking to you even when the vehicle is shut down and all systems are off | This thing floats over the bumps with its extended wheelbase and handles better than any vehicle that we test drove with the exception of the Landrover LR2 which also handled equally as well | My wife who's afraid to drive anything too big says it drives like a large sedan | We bought the limited version for just a few hundred over invoice and have no regrets | If you must fit 3 in the second row of the vehicle this is the only vehicle that can make everyone comfortable | 
 "words": We have owned this car for 3 weeks now and love it just as much as our 2006 Ford FreeStyle | We have owned an ExplorerWindstar and traded our 2005 F150 extra crew Lariet for this Taurus and now have the Freestyle and the Taurus X in the driveway | These cars hold a 400 to 500 shopping spree to Sam's club and still the 2 kids | with a breeze | We just have to decide which one to take | Gas mileage has been great | Pickup is wonderful can really tell the difference on the Taurus X | Love my push button back lid opening | And my husband loves the Freestyle as much as his truck- Loves the gas mileage even better | You have to get the Taurus X | Will tow and packs a lot | 
 "words": We upgraded an 04 Tribute for the Taurus X | The X is quieter has more cargo and people space has all the safety features standard and gets about the same mileage we got 25 mpg on our 40 mi drive home with the car | Fit and finish look fine | Nice ride | 
 "words": Had my TX for a month now 1500 miles on it | Very happy with purchase did lots of research on crossovers and test drives tested AcadiaOutlookSuzuki XL7 Mazda CX9 and TX was the best handling and most fun car to drive | Plus price and fuel economy is the best as well | Don't understad how some drivers are driving if they geting lower MPG than advertised | Hello whats about using cruise control and other fuel saving tips | I am getting 24mpg average althought I must admit I drive 70-80 on highway | But even in city never got less then 18 | 5MPG | But of course if you like to push gas pedal to the floor and strain that new 3 | 5 lt engine all the time than thats what you get | 
 "words": I've had the X for about two weeks now and I've really enjoyed it | The main issue with its predecessor the FreeStyle was that it was underpowered | This has been corrected with the new X | Unfortunately the mpg has suffered | I'm getting significantly less than the 19 mpg comparison figure or the 16 city mpg listed | The crossover has been surprisingly responsive the braking smoothand the ride comfortable | There is a few fit and finish issue with the running board but it is not major | I upgraded with leather and the DVD entertainment system and am very happy with both | The utility is great as the third row seats fold flat with a very quick and easy 3 step process | Good job Ford |
