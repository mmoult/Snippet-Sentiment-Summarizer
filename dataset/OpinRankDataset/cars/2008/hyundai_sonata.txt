REVIEWS
 "words": My 08 has several issues and all seem common with my fellow owner | Loose molding strips a failed oxygen sensor failed tire pressure lights | The warranty is attractive but read the small print I was disappointed with a transmission issue | This car looks nice but is sluggish around 30- 40mph | It really should not be compared to a Accord or Camry unless of course you can measure intangible issues with the cost savings | It does not have the re-sale value associated with Japanese vehicles | 
 "words": Very solid car and all problems since I've owned it have been taken care of free of charge | They were only minor | Sagging mirror but likely due to a cd case hanging on it | Dead battery | Seat issue | I even got a free rental for two of the fixes | I have been really happy so far with the car | Very spacey and quiet | And even though it is cheaper than most other cars looks more expensive in some areas compared to others I have looked at | 
 "words": I have a 2008 Sonata the brakes are gone after less than 18K miles of very light driving | the dealer said that they are not part of the so much advertised hyundai warranty | too bad they said | Hey brakes that do not even last 18K is this hyundai's quality | It seems so | I wonder what else will be braking soon | I will never ever buy a hyundai again and I advise against buying one | Yes they are a little cheaper than the Japanese cars but so much worse | My wife has a Japanese car for over 6 years over 60K not a single problem with it | Keep away from hyundai | And yes their service at least here in Henrietta NY is terrible | 
 "words": The car seemed OK and when I drove it for a while I got home and looked under the hood | Most of the fluids where not at the proper level | I topped them myself rather than drive 40 miles back | The engine luggs at 40 MPH when in top gear | Suspension handles bumps in a way that feels odd like the tires are bouncing over the bumps | The dealer claims an oil change is needed every 3000 miles and the company backs this up but when I first got the car they said 3000 only for severe use | Now they say everything in the US is severe | I had 2 mechanical problems with a tire pressure detector malfunction and a brake problem | Their best warranty did not cover anything | 
 "words": After researching and test driving Honda Accords Toyota Camrys and finally the Sonata Limited it was clear that for the money I was able to get luxury with the Sonata that I wouldn't get with other 2 | We have always driven Hondas 7 to date and my husband was skeptical about going with a Sonata | However I made the decision to get the Sonata and once the dealer agreed to my terms | no down zero percent interest and payments under 300 for the Limited its was a done deal | I love driving the car and it's super comfortable on road trips | The only negative to say is that the side door molding loosened and had to be replaced and the driver's side visor has had to be replaced | 
 "words": Short and simple | This car is outstanding | I may not have scored it very high in comparison to other reviews but I'm rating it on a scale in comparison to other cars I've owned | I have highly recommended this car to others | I purchased it new for 6k less than a 4 cylinder accord ex-l | It is quieter than our acura tl and rides much more comfortable especially on long trips | No rattles or issues whatsoever | The 4 cylinder is fairly slow but I bought it for the gas mileage | I can get right at 30 mpg if I keep it under 70 mph | I drive mostly interstate commute | I check it at the pump and not just by the computer | 
 "words": I bought my Sonata after renting a few on business trips and was very impressed with the car | The 6 has all kinds of get up and go and smooth | This car is very quiet at 70 mph and fairly nimble when doing evasive maneuvers | A lot of bang for the buck and even better reliability | Mine nw has 32000 miles at 15 months of age and has never been in the shop for repairs | I think it blows away the competition as far as price performance and comfort | Yeah I'd buy another one | 
 "words": One year plus 25000 miles totally problem free | I usually keep a car about 1 year but this is my first keeper | Still love it and still get a lot oo enjoyment driving it | Only has had routine oil changes and tire rotation and still looks and drives like the day I bought it | Looked at Totota Mazda Nisson and made the right choice | 
 "words": I replaced a 2003 Toyota Avalon XLS with the 2008 Sonata Limited V6 and LOVE IT | I've had it about 16 months now and am 100 satisfied | I like others was a little cautious of buying a Hyundai but have zero regrets | I really wanted a Prius when I started looking but the price was in the stratosphere and figured it would take 5 years to make up the difference in gas | I looked at the Avalon's and Camry's but just couldn't justify the HUGE price difference | The interior design and quality is not on par with the Avalon but is nearly as good as the Camry | It was all the bundled features V6 traction and stability control safety features Infinity audio and creature comforts that sold me | 
 "words": I've had the car for about ten months now and it has been excellent good mileage no mechanical issues it's my first Hyundai so I wasn't exactly sure of what to expect very satisfied | I live in Canada and unfortunately the 4 cylinder cars don't have traction control or stability control | not sure about this standard on all cars in the states come on Hyundai we're the ones who really need these features | So I'd be sure to get those features in my next one or if I could start over as winter traction could certainly have been better | Otherwise he car has been great drive lots runs great could have an oil life monitor more headroom and a power passenger seat next car will | 
 "words": I've had my Hyundai Sonata Limited for a little more than a month now and I am loving it | I have never owned a Hyundai and have always driven Nissans | Traded an 04 Maxima SE for the Sonata because of the remarkable warranty | You can't beat it | The Sonata is fun to drive and I found it to be much quieter than the Nissan | Power is more than sufficient and the CVVT shifts flawlesly | Interior room is spacious but I think the fore aft position on the seat tract should be a bit longer | I love the Infinity sound system however I had to take it back to the dealer 2X to fix an annoying rattle in the rear deck coming from the 3rd brake light | I also think the suspension should be firmer | 
 "words": This is the 4th Hyundai I have owned we bought the Entourage last year which is great | I have to say after owning Fords and Hondas this Hyundai Sonata has exceeded my expectations over the other manufacturers | You just can't consider Hyundai as a stereotypical 'cheap' quality vehicle | The ride is smooth and the V6 engine provides ample power 234 HP | The interior design shows quality and there are safety features galore | In addition the gas mileage is reasonable | From past experience I have had virtually no problems with defects etc | compared to other makes I have owned | The Hyundai warranty is the proof in the pudding | I will not buy from another car manufacturer | 
 "words": i did the research and Hyundai has improved in quality and reliabilty every year | Move over Toyota
 "words": After extensive researchI decided to buy a 2008 Sonata | When comparing it to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry I decided that the Sonata offered more bang for the buck | While not as stylish as the Accord and Camry it doesn't have the aura that car thiefs relish | I selected the Limited with the 3 | 3L V6 | The acceleration is good and the CVT is flawless | Ride is firm when necessary and feels cushy on the highway | Road noise is average but cabin comfort is fantastic | The fit and finish are superb and the Infinity sound system with the rear window mounted subwooofer is impressive | Its my first Hyundai and I have to say that the history of driver and magazine reviews were accurate | 
 "words": This is my first Hyundai since I have always been skeptical about buying the Hyundai brand | After extensive research I settled with the Sonata GLS | I haven't had too many miles yet since I have only gotten it | The car feels comfortable and everything feels just fine | It's comparable to other Accord Civic Maxima that I have had owned or better | A few things are missing AUX inlet steeling wheel mounted radio control etc but they are not the show stoppers | The good things are it comes with the exceptional warranty others are copying it too ESC all kinds of airbags | Another good selling point is you can knock off quite a bit from the price | This is impossible for other comparable cars
 "words": had a 2002 camry le | this car is 10 times better to drive better ride better breaks | best car i ever had | most fun to drive
 "words": Sharp looking car | The interior is incredibly comfortable and supportive | The seats adjust to fit you perfectly | As I am a taller driver leg room and head room are important | My two boys are also quite tall and they have PLENTY of leg room in the back | I went from an 8 year old smaller SUV to this car and so far have been very very impressed | It's quiet smooth and a pleasure to drive | The trunk gives me as much room as my SUV did | I can hit Sam's Club and the grocery store plus have room leftover | Try it when you are shopping | Research is great but you have to drive your top picks to make a good decision | I think you will be pleasantly surprised | 
 "words": Car is well made looks great and drives extremely well | Hyundai has come along way | I drove many new cars while shopping for a new vehicle nothing compared to the Sonata | Great car | 
 "words": Got my '08 GL Canadian model manual transmission in late June | Car has been great so far except for a rear parcel shelf rattle that I can't get rid of | It is comfortable smooth riding roomy and peppy with the manual | The engine is very easy to stall with the manual though | Mileage is also good | Wind noise is fairly noticeable even at normal speeds | Big car feel for a very good price | Overall I bought a drab but well equipped and competent intermediate for the price of a compact with a good waranty to boot in case of issues | 
 "words": i love driving our new sonata | it has a smooth ride and plenty of powerv when you need it | i also like the new stle change
 "words": The Sonata was not on my original list of cars I was looking at a Civic hybrid or Accord | But the fuel mileage styling and warranty made me take a closer look | The final factor was a 3000 rebate | I saved several thousand dollars over what I thought I'd have to spend to get a high quality stylish sedan | Having owned it for a full year now I can honestly say I am 100 satisfied with the car mileage in the 27-28 range zero service or mechanical issuesi | I m really glad I chose the Hyundai | Can't wait to trade it up for a new Genisis in a couple of years | 
 "words": I bought this car with 30k miles on it and have driven it about 2k miles | I love this car | Getting onto the highway is stress-free because this car can get-up-and-go when you put your foot into it | Its got some nut which I like in a car | Its quiet and smooth | I like the sunroof and the ample room of the interior | Its comfortable and an ease to drive | Gas mileage is about 31 highway or more and 19 town | I can't speak for long term reliability but it purrs like a kitten and is nearly soundless at idle no engine noises or clickings | Performance for a mid- sized 4 door family car like this is not common | 
 "words": I purchased this car because I was looking for an affordable ride which would offer economy reliability and still offer that high class I used to get while driving my Lexus | I found all that plus more in my base 2008 Sonata GLS | It comes standard with all of the safety features that come as options in a Camry XLE
 "words": This car is built very cheaply | The interior plastic surfaces squeak and the front suspension has a really annoying squeak rattle | The interior lights don't come on when you remove the ignition key | The switches on the door lock unlock windows etc | are not illuminated | The ignition key ring taps against the dash board when driving | The Infinity sound system's subwoofer is mounted in the cardboard deck behind the rear seats and creates an annoying distortion even at low volume |

 "words": As I pulled the car out for the test drive I told the dealer that if I hear loud wind noises we can forget about Hyundai altogether | I drove about 8 miles in city and 8 miles on freeway where I briefly reached 80 mph effortlessly | The handling was responsive the ride very smooth and quiet later I found out that Hyundai engineers redesigned the door hinges and side mirrors to reduce wind noise | The average mileage for my test drive was 26mpg | I really would love it to be close to 29-30 mpg but I can live with it since I drive only 20 miles to and from work each day and once month a trip of about 220 miles | The 17 | 7 gallon fuel tank should get me a long way | Love everything | 
 "words": Floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee | In other words it feels like a luxury car when you drive it but still has amazing performance for the small engine size | You don't need the 6 cyl engine in a world of rising gas prices | This is the best car I've ever had and I doubt I'll ever have another one as nice | 
 "words": The Sonata Limited is loaded with features | You name it it has it | Except for Navigation | But other than that it has all the options I'd ask for and for the price that I can't imagine with any other manufacturer | I have about 6000 miles now and enjoying it everyday | 
 "words": Just purchased and love this car | Performance is decent it is a family car after all | I opted for the gls with popular package and sunroof | I was bummed that there is no ipod jack | No biggie I had one installed works great too | I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a respectable mid-size family type sedan | Look no further | Rims tinted Windows and spoiler do wonders for the bland styling | 
 "words": The first things that jumped out to me on my new 2008 Sonata was the construction of the vehicle | Everything was tight and in place | Quietness was second | It is quiet smooth and responsive | Last but not least is that it is bringing me 30-32MPG and is fun to drive | Not bad for a car that had a 3K rebate and has a 5 yr bumper to bumper warranty and has all the safety features out there | That folks is value | 
 "words": This is my first time owning a Sonata by Hyundai I've owned a lot of cars over the years and I have to say that this car rides smoother than any 4 cyl I've ever owned the ride is smooth pick- up is great the trunk is very large | the styling is great ive added the all weather floor mats and the full bra and the window vent covers it all looks great on the polar white | the fuel mileage is great for this size of car 26 in the city so far and haven't taken it on the highway yet | XM is great love the 6 speakers and sound | Saved thousands of dollars compared to the Honda and Toyota's |

 "words": I bought this car after reading all the good things about it online Plus good features and support | But after owning it from last 3 months i feel it was a bad Bad BAD decision and i should have gone for Camry | The Vehicle has very high inside noise No aerodynamics at all Cold start is really really BAD and noisy | At just 5000 miles it has started to have some vibration noise Passenger side air bag OFF sign remains off even when person of 100 LB sits on it suspension is not very helpful in rough roads sometime you literally feel like pushing engine to the full capacity Driving is no fun AM radio is not very clear | Never gonna buy anything from Hyundai EVER | 
 "words": I went to one dealership | I was looking at the Elantra | Way too small | I asked the salesperson about the Elantra deal and they said You mean the Sonata deal | I had no idea | I got over 1400 off | It is a beautiful color and there is as much room as my old Camry | The kids like it | I just need to get used to a standard | The car handles great and I like how huge the trunk is | The glow in dark emergency release lever is great | I love showing it off | I got every kind of warranty that was offered | I feel like I am riding around in a safety bubble | 
 "words": Have learned to trust automobile ratings by Consumer Reports especially when confirmed by owner's evaluations at Edmunds | The Sonata has earned those high ratings | Solid performance with surprising good acceleration both around town and on the highway for a four cylinder engine | Anti-lock breaks are firm and secure | Turning and cornering are comfortable | Seating has prominent lower back support | Two minor quibbles each with solution | Passenger seat belt in retracted position bangs around against center post when windows rolled down | Lever on passenger seat can be used to clip seat belt away from post | Second side of car easily gets muddy on wet streets solved by mud flaps | 
 "words": I have been looking at the Sonatas for months now and finally jumped in when I saw the 3000 rebate | Since the first time I saw it I thought it reminded me of a BMW or high-end Honda | Beautiful lines and Xenon headlamps make it a very sexy car | Even the XM FM radio antenna complete this picture | The front fog lamps are also cool looking | The 4Cyl is by far the most powerful and quietest 4Cyl I've ever driven | It easily compares with my stock 6Cyl Nissan Maxima engine for acceleration | It was an easy choice after test driving the 4 and 6 | Yes the 6Cyl is VERY powerful and fast but the extra 2000 price tag plus the annual increase in fuel cost of 400 is simply not worth it | 
 "words": The 2008 Hyundai Leather Seats are totally unacceptable | I owned a 2006 Sonata and the seats were perfect | My Neighbor has a 2007 Sonata and the seats are perfect | Hyundai must have lowered their quality standards Michellin Tire are no longer Standard on the Sonata and the seats front and back have are wrinkled as much as 1 2 | Why pay 1000 | 00 extra for sub-quality leather seats | The local Hyundai order a new seat for me and it was worst than the original one | Is this a recall issue |

 "words": This is my first hyundai | No problems so far but I will keep my fingers crossed | Just had it for a month though | Some low quality plastics in the interior | Even my 93 camry and 89 civic had better materials | So you can't compete with camcords but then again I didn't want to pay 7 grands extra for camcord anyway | Highway ride is smooth city driving is not bad either except for fuel economy and a little harsh ride on bigger bumps | No engine noise tire noise is bearable and so is the wind noise | We had a wind storm the other day and some gusts were blowing even more than 50 miles per hour and I didn't feel any cross winds except for wind noise |

 "words": I am a mechanical engineer and did extensive research before buying a car | I keep my cars for 10 years and wanted something with longevity | My previous car was an infinty G20t and I thought I wanted the new G35 but I simply could not justify spending 35k on a new car when I am planning on going back to school next year | The Hyundai is SO comfortable | I LOVE THE SOUND SYSTEM | I wouldn't call it the 'sportiest' car but at this point in my life I'm enjoying a softer ride | The warranty and features are UNBEATABLE for the cost | I am so pleased I was able to get all the features of a luxury car for so much less | I bought my new Sonata through Costco and got a great price |
