 "words": After shopping around my friend suggested the XL7 and I am glad I looked | I was amazed at the features that were included with the car and such a great price | It's sporty and stylish yet roomy enough for my entire family | Great car for an amazing price | 
 "words": Best bang for the buck looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind good luck | Anyway needed something that the kids or an adult could could actually sit comfortably and with room behind the third row for luggage groceries etc | This was it | With the rebates and incentives they took 8k off sticker | You cannot buy anything like this at that price | 
 "words": I have been eying the XL7 for some time now | I owned an Aerio SX but I was hit by an elderly woman and it was totaled | I was in Japan for 3 years and all I saw was Suzuki cars every where | Hardly any Hondas | So when i got back to the States I went to the dealership offered 19000 and i drove it off the lot | I have no complaints rides smooth and it looks good | I would call it a crossover before an SUV |

 "words": This is my first new ride and I am quite pleased with my selection | I haven't had much time to drive it as it seems I'm busy 24 7 with my 2 jobs but at least I got to take it about 60 miles outside of Denver the other day and then back and I'm very impressed with its ride stability performance and toys | With the navy blue paint and factory chrome wheels I get plenty of compliments on my selection | 
 "words": A great value for a seven seater | The usable 2 extra back seats are great for kids yet even small adults | Plus the 2 extra seats have airbags so safety is considered unlike other SUVs we compared The inside design is basic and not all that stand-out yet functional | Has a very small front compartment which would be great if bigger | The back viewable area is poor due to the small windows so I would highly recommend a back up camera system | The turning radius is large making it difficult to make tight turns like most SUVs | Safety features crash test rating are great as well as the warranty | This is probably the least expensive 7 seater mid-size SUV on the market and so far we love it | 
 "words": Bought this for my wife who really wanted a Toyota | However the best deal we could find on a similar Toyota was 10K more and they offered 4K less on the trade in | For 14k less I talked her into the Suzuki | I have owned many new cars of about every make and never had one that didn't have anything that needed to be corrected in the first few months | That is until the XL7 absolutly everything was perfect | My wife loves the vehicle | 
 "words": We looked at the Mazda 9 very nice looked at Honda Pilot CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander and the Hyundai Santa Fe Veracruz nice also | But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff the Suzuki really blows them away | Adding the no deductible 7 year 100000 mile warranty free loan car that covers exerything except the battery and tires | Even a burned out bulb is covered | Amazing | And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating | 
 "words": I have mainly owned Toyotas | Prior to the XL7 I had a Sienna XLE | I loved that van and didn't think I would ever want a different vehicle | When I had the opportunity to drive the XL7 for several days I knew that was the SUV for me | I haven't been disappointed yet |

 "words": I was looking for a midsize SUV for around 30k and drove almost all the competition | When I saw the XL7 I figured let me take this for a ride it really was not high on my list | But after looking at all the features you get for the money it probably is the best value on the market | It has a solid but smooth ride great pickup and has nice style both in and out | It has one of the best warranties in the market very little maintenance | It even has a timing chain instead of a belt so you don't have that periodic 500 expense | Although 7 passengers is a stretch 5 or 6 can fit fine |
