 "words": I bought it used a few weeks ago after much research thought and comparisons | I am 59 years old and have owned many cars | My favorite up to this point was a 1998 Lincoln Continental | I had 90 decided the Avalon Touring was as close as I would ever get to my old continental so I finally went to try one out | The minute I hit the highway I knew this was the one | I couldn't be happier after three weeks and 1500 miles | Perfect car for me | 
 "words": The Avalon XLS I bought in 1998 now has 180000 miles and is going strong | I hoped to repeat this performance with my new 2008 Avalon Limited | The Toyota quality is just no longer there | Problems include road noise whining and jerking transmission seats uncomfortable and squeaking GPS is totally worthless paint quality is horrible rear sunshade activates for no reason console is obtrusive limited visibility for backing and much more | I would advise avoiding Toyota until they return to building great cars like those of ten years ago |

 "words": I owned 2 Honda Accord Limited then changed to Camry Limited in 2005 | Loved it but decided to upgrade to the Avalon in 2008 | I absolutely LOVE the comfort quiet ride giddy-up when you need to move but can't agree more with the other reviewers that Toyota needs to REIMBURSE ALL OF US WHO WASTED THE MONEY ON THE GPS | IT IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST SYSTEM | Completely unfriendly | I had the touchscreen version on my Camry and it was much better | Better to buy a NUVI- just bought an 885T and LOVE IT | Significantly cheaper than the MAJOR RIPPOFF OF TOYOTAS SYSTEM | 
 "words": I like the quiet ride | Seats are comfortable but with my long legs I would prefer for the seat to go back more | The GPS totally stinks don't blow your money on it I have a 200 dollar GPS for my other car that is WAY easier to use | The traction control should have a manual override button | I got stuck on the hill going up my driveway in an ice storm and needed a bit more wheel spin the traction control did not allow it | I love the headlights for brightness but just found out that the replacement bulbs are 325 EACH and yes I did say 325 EACH | Both went out at once at 50000 miles and neither the basic warranty or the extended warranty covers it | 
 "words": I just purchased this 2008 Avalon replacing a 2001 BMW 530i | the Avalon is NOT a BMW | On the other hand it burns the same amount of regular fuel is very comfortable to drive has great traction in snow and has more bells and whistles than the 530 | The BMW cost a fortune to service yes the BMW folks are as polite and pleasant as all heck as they charge 150 for an oil change and I am hoping that the Toyota does not | The fit and finish are equal and the Avalon cost about 20000 less | Am I happy | you bet I am

 "words": 2008 Toyota Avalon Limited | Great car good looking very nice ride | However with the traction control there is no way to disengage | In snow Ice sometimes you need to spin your wheels | Once the traction control engages it shuts down the power and wheel spin | great for some things terrible in the snow when you need wheel spin | Other than that no complaints |

 "words": Owned 2000 2003 now 2008 XLS | Only concern going in was the transmission | Since the 6speed replaced the 2007 5 speed I decided to go for it | So far the 2008 excels over the 2003 in almost every respect trunk has slightly less usable space |

 "words": If you are looking or a true luxury large car with lots of room at a reasonable price this is it | Not another competitor can come close and you get it with Toyota reliability and quality | Styling could be improved but if Toyota did that then there truly is no reason to buy a Lexus LS | Seems same reasoning went into nav system | Portable GPS has touch screen for less than 200 now | This one doesn't | Lexus GPS does | If Toyota cleaned up a few very low cost details there would be no reason for the Lexus brand | Toyota's challenge is keeping the goodness of this product away from their prospective Lexus customers |

 "words": Pros Push Button Start Stop Mileage Power w 6 speed Auto Trans Roomy Cons Soft Breaks External Looks there's nothing special about the design I bought an Avalon Limited 2008 in November of 07 | I think this car is great | The mileage on regular gasoline is around 26 mpg I drive mostly highway | Before this car I had a 2001 BMW 330i | So the avalon seems not very responsive to cornering and hugging the road | However an avalon is more of a cruising car | and not a performance car | I would say the acceleration is more then enough and actually comparable to my old BMW however take the turns slow as slow as the avalon will lean when taking a sharp turn | 
 "words": We previously owned a '96 Avalon and were very pleased with it | This car however is superior in almost every way | We tested against Lexus Infiniti M Acura for features performance fuel economy and price this was the correct decision | This is an outstanding automobile | The styling is a bit stodgy and the navigation system a bit cumbersome but these minor drawbacks are more than made up for with comfort engine response fuel economy for the HP and overall integrity fit and finish | I spent 3 years researching this choice and we made the right one | Nice going Toyota |

 "words": I had a '99 Avalon and now '08 | New Avalon has smooth and solid ride and gives sense of safety | Turning radius is tight for a big car and this is a plus | I miss the bench seat in the '99 | Entry and exit on new Avalon is terrible | I am female-5'6 sr and have to practically back in to enter and swing my legs out they still hit the side of car to exit | Door is too big and heavy | Toyota might be trying to appeal to younger buyer and may lose seniors if high beltline heavy doors and entry exit are not improved | My husband who is 5'11 cannot get into this car without extensive planning and exact maneuvering-not enough leg room for driver | Need more room in front-not back
 "words": I tried to talk myself into the LS 460 or the ES350 | It came down to the ES and I decided to save 10000 and still got a superior vehicle more bells and whistles better ride more room even larger in back seat than the 460 better gas mileage average for us is almost 29 more power regular gas | The car is so smooth the only thing I downgraded was fun to drive | I have a back problem and traded a cadillac to get something really comfortable | This is it | My last three cars have been Cadillac SRX Infiniti Q45 and Lexus LS 400 | The Limited Avalon is superior to the Caddy and equivalent of the 400 and 430 and Q45 | I cannot believe I got this much car for this price |
