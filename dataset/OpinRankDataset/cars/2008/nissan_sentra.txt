REVIEWS
 "words": I've had my Sentra for 18 mos | and have come to the conclusion that it is just OK | I have 25000 miles on it and it has been reliable-no mechanical problems | That said having been a Honda owner previously Civics and Accords I wish now that I had stuck with Honda for two reasons comfort and fuel economy | I drive 120 miles daily on straight flat highways and the best I have ever gotten was 32 MPG | I did better than that with my Accord which was bigger and more powerful and far better than that with my Civic | Regarding comfort the absence of telescopic steering means having to drive with outstretched arms which is uncomfortable and annoying | Also road noise is a bit loud | 
 "words": Ok so I've had my sentra for almost a year now | This car does well as far as gas mileage since I drive 50 miles one way commuting back and forth to work | All and all it's a great car with great gas mileage only thing is the steering wheel is rather hard to steer and limits your movement as far as hand placement | For a tall and thin sedan this car seems very grounded and handles curves alright | 
 "words": i recently purchased this car used with nissans certified pre-owned program | That being said I cannot find anything inherently wrong with the car design without nitpicking | Yes the CVT transmission takes some getting used to and the stability when driving spirited leaves me wanting more | It is to say that this is a commuter vehicle and as such performs its daily tasks appropriatly to its design | No it is not a speed racer and its not ment to be | Seeing that the speed limit in my state is still 70 mph the sentra seems to work well at this speed for long distances | as for anyone complaining about the whirring noise from the transmission at speed needs to just turn some music on | 
 "words": This car gets great gas mileage and the exterior of the car is very Nice | But it is the most uncomfortable car that I have ever had to drive | The steering wheel is extremely uncomfortable I feel like I can never adjust my hands and elbows to a comfortable position while driving it | 
 "words": After owning only American cars I love my Nissan Sentra my wife owns an 06 Altima | We have 5 kids 3 at home and this car is quick CVT great gas mileage 29 city and 34 Hwy | I am 6 | 2 and find it very comfortable with space left in the back for an adult with extra head room | I think it is very quiet and runs on the highway very smoothly for a small car | Now is it like my pervious Lincoln Towncar no way | But is far better than any other | midsize | car I have owned | The only complaint is winter time in Iowa being small it can be a challenge to drive in very heavy snow | I love this car and it is all I need | 
 "words": I'm a mid-to-later aged guy who is basically lazy and let me tell you that this car with the telephone modem and keyless entry is a dream | Except for the fact that it's a bit tall and thin so it doesn't have the stability of say my honda civic it is a really a great car and has a lot of room inside and in the hide away trunk | I only get about 26mpg but I'm a heavy-footer | I've broken the darn drivers mirror off twice in my tight garage so I think they need to be foldable | The mpg avg on the dash is a joke but the radio is great | I have noticed that the tire pressure is a major issue and between the low pressure alarm as well as veering to one side or the other | 
 "words": This is the third Nissan we have owned | My wife loves them | She opted for the 6 speed which is smooth and fun to drive | We have 11k miles on the car and so far so good except for one squeak in the back no one can find | The fuel mileage is great at 36 mpg Hwy | The biggest improvement would be a little more leg room for the knees the shifter console is rough on them after a few miles | Overall very satisfied and will keep for about 6 years | Thanks Nissan and keep up the Good work |

 "words": I have had my Sentra for over a year now | The new Sentra design is much better than the previous models | This is really a French Car with Renault roots | Built for ride quality comfort and quiet traveling | Also inside it is as big as a mid size car although the outside looks very compact | I enjoyed several trips in this car and I do not miss having a bigger mid size car at all | CVT tranny takes a little getting use to and car will drift a little on very windy days due to the height of the car | Everyone interested in a compact car should drive a Sentra for sure | 
 "words": I got the SL fully loaded and for the most part the car is great | The build quality seems to be pretty decent although the sunglasses holder is definitely flimsy | I like the sound system sunroof Intelligent key and trip computer | On the highway I do get about 32-33 MPG but in the city I get terrible mileage | I do drive probably 3 miles at a time sometimes so that was to be expected | My only complaint was that the brake light has come on twice thus far I'm only about 5500 miles in both times for reasons beyond anyone's comprehension | Nissan's warranty covered everything but it was troubling nevertheless | 
 "words": I just purchased a 2008 Nissan Sentra and am very pleased with both the comfort and the performance | The 6-speed manual transmission is very easy to shift and the ride is very smooth with the 16 wheels | I would recommend this car to a friend |

 "words": We really wanted to get the Yaris sedan but they were on back order | After test driving the 08'Yaris hatchback 09'Corolla | We weren't impressed at all | So we headed to Nissan | We test drove the Versa sedan and I have to say that even that car drove better than the Toyota's | Then we drove the Sentra | WOW | It is quite and we were very impressed that we purchased it on the spot | And we had no intentions of buying a car that day | Its a fun and awesome car | Infact the back seat is roomier than my hubby's 03'Galant | It fits 2 adults 2 kids comfortably | This is just a 3rd car for us but I have a hard time giving it up so my hubby can have his turn | The CVT is awesome too | 
 "words": Went around looking at every car in the mid size range that you can think of I tried so hard to avoid the Sentra | Look at everything Corolla Jetta Hyundai Accent etc but they just seemed dull | Then my parents talked me into it taking a look at Nissan | I couldn't believe i had avoided it for so long | I had to opt for the S because let's just face it the base was bland | So far getting great mileage if you are considering the Sentra go for the S and add the convenience plus package for a few dollars more | You wont regret it

 "words": Originally I was interested in the Versa until I realized I could have the Sentra for a little more | I found the Sentra very roomy and lots of nice little extras such as a trip computer that will display time outside temp and average fuel economy amongst other things | The Sentra is peppy with very good mpg and handles well | The styling is modern and the ride very quiet compared to our Sonata |
