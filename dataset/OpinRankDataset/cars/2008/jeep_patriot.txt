REVIEWS
 "words": We traded our 2005 jeep wrangler in on this 2008 Trail rated Patriot | We got a quiet ride on the highwayfinallyand didn't give up our off road fun | This car definitely has a dual purpose | I recommend this car for its fuel economy | I recommend this car for its easy driving and parking in town and I love this car for the fun of short off road trips | 
 "words": I have driven this car for 18 months | I have had no problems to date | It handles very well in snow rain and muddy dirt roads | Fuel economy is around 24-25 but decreases significantly with anything on the roof | I just installed two infant seats and barely fit them in | I am 5'10 and had to pull the seat 1 click forward from my usual position to fit them in | If you have long legs and plan on adding a car seat buy different car | 
 "words": Rear view mirror positioned too low causing visibility problems | Plastic door finish vibrates | Lots of road noise | Water leaks in front dome light could be front window seal | Impossible to utilize indicator switch at night without flipping to high beam | Great gas mileage 45 imperial mpg 60 mph on flat highway 30 mpg in town | Mechanical no problems whatsoever after 12000 miles | Tremendous traction in snow | 
 "words": My first time writing a review but had to let everyone know how well the Jeep Patriot drives | I had mine almost two years and haven't had one issue to repair or replace | Love the plastic interior as I have two big dogs | Seats are comfortable and easily cleaned | The performance is great | I do a lot of city driving and still average 24 mpg | I couldn't beat the price of less than 13000 | Well done Jeep | With the money I saved not buying a Rav-4 or CRV I had a great cross country trip in my Patriot | 
 "words": We have owned this Patriot since February 2008 | We are glad that we chose and were able to get the manual transmission with the 2 | 4L engine | You need to plan to accelerate and be in the right gear when passing or other | Yes it would be nice to have more power or maybe a small turbo but it has been a great vehicle | For the price and options we have it has delivered all we expected and more | The only glitch has been on rare occasions where we have experienced some type of unbalance when driving and using the 4 x 4 | It is not a wheel or tire issue possibly something with the transfer case | We plan to replace it with an identical model if we can find one on a dealer lot someday
 "words": After driving a van for so many years I wanted something smaller and more gas efficient | In the city I get 20-21 mpg | I don't touch the stick shift and I'm fine with that | On the highway it a dream I thought that the small engine would sputter but it's smooth as silk no hesitation in front of any vehicle | Once friends and family see the style and learn about the package they are impressed and want to drive my Flaming Red Beauty | 
 "words": Well I'm a die-hard jeep fan | of Wranglers | Had a Sahara and then a Rubicon | but the mileage was killing me so I downgraded to a better MPG model | This car is no fun and I had the engine REPLACED at 13000 miles and as of today the entire A C unit is being replaced as I key | As soon as this lease is up I'm going back to the Wrangler | 
 "words": A pleasant surprise | After being locked into Hondas Toyotas and Nissans for 25 years I am very happy with my Patriot | It is a Jeep so the creature comforts are prioritized a hair lower fine by me | Love the look the practicality and the affordabilty | Great size for commuting- rides higher than a sedan and fits in any parking space with ease | This 4 cylinder has plenty of power see favorite features | I question anyone complaining about the power this from a man who learned to drive in a '73 Malibu with a 350 V8 | If the long term reliability is any good this will be my best new car purchase ever | 
 "words": Acceleration is gradual but will be good enough for merging in the freeway | It handles like a car | The back pillar does create a blind spot but the large side mirrors help slightly with the issue | Overall I love driving my Patriot | maybe a little too much | 
 "words": I own a 2008 Patriot 4WD | It is not the trail-rated version but has the CVT2 | Since purchasing it I have had it during two ice storms one in early 2008 and the horrific one here in Kentucky in 2009 | And during both storms there was one constant this Jeep just can't get stuck | No matter where I was driving even without being the trail-rated version it handled everything including hills that full-sized trucks with off-road packages couldn't even come close to handling | The fuel economy is great but it's not sluggish | Acceleration is great and the auto-stick is a lot of fun and helps with city MPGs | The interior isn't luxurious but it's a great utility interior | 
 "words": I had misgivings about the CVT based on what I had read however could not find a limited with 5 speed manual so went ahead with 2 | 4 CVT | First weekend after break in took the family from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon | The hill up to Sunset point is notorious for slow downs given its grade | Set the cruise at 75 mph the CVT was smooth and able to maintain 70 mph | My old 4 | 0 Cherokee had trouble maintaining 70 up this hill so I am now a believer in the CVT | By the way I also managed 29 mpg on the trip | This is my fourth jeep 2 Cherokees 1 Wrangler and so far this jeep is living up to my expectations
 "words": This is the best bang for your buck in its class | Pure Jeep no frills | Fun factor way up there | I bought 2 | 
 "words": If you are looking for a no frills vehicle with just your basic comforts this is a great choice | The price is also a huge plus | For basic driving the Patriot is comfortable and very adequate | I am 6 ft 1 and I have plenty of room as well as good foot room for backseat passengers | The LED detachable light is great and so is the IPOD jack | 
 "words": I was driving a F250 Lariat Crewcab but the high cost of diesel forced me to downsize | I test drove so many small SUVs and never though I would like a Jeep | My first ride in the Patriot was an instant sale | It is such a cool vehicle and looks good too | I am fascinated with the 4WD and Autostick features | I went from paying 100 a week in fuel to only 40 | The inside is very roomy and just by adding a custom seat cushion I now have the feel of a Lexus at half the price | My Boss drives a Land Rover but to be honest the Patriot is just as classy and having the 4WD capabilities makes it just easy to stand up to his Land Rover | Buy One | You will love it | 
 "words": 10000 miles and still loving it not the fastest but smooth to drive and built with quality | I like chicken | 5 spd manual had a little trouble grinding in 3rd gear but local chrysler dodge jeep dealer fixed it right up with a new blocker ring | Towed a 2500 or more load from Michigan to Texas in 2 days over foothills of mountains no trouble at all and not equipped with tow package however i do run synthetic | This car was perfect for me with the basic package because the vinyl is easy to clean and the removable rear cargo floor is easy to clean | I am very happy with my new Jeep and look forward to a long companionship | Purchased extended warranty- lifetime bumper to bumper good buy | 
 "words": Everyone is abandoning SUVs because of the bad MPG and costs overall to purchase | So I figured I would see if there was a steal out there in the mass exodus hype to leave SUVs | And I found one | I got my Patriot a complete base model that now in 2008 at least has AC standard for 12400 after rebates incentives and military discount | Just drove it 220 miles across parts of Carolina and got 33 MPG highway going 65 mph | It's manual transmission which is fine with me | Windows locks are manual again OK with me | The best thing is the larger engine 4 | 2 gets better MPG with manual transmission The only complaint is that options add up FAST which is why I kept it basic | 
 "words": My fiancee and I bought our Patriot in March of this year | We love the fact that it meets or exceeds the gas mileage on the window sticker every time | Another great aspect of the Patriot is the utility | The fold-flat passenger seat and the 115 watt inverter along with the Yes Essentials seats and rechargeable flashlight are priceless | We have a small family and a limited budget and couldn't have spent our money more wisely | 
 "words": We are about a month into owning our jeep patriot and we love it | You just can't beat it for the price | It is cheap to insure among the best for safety gets good gas mileage we get 22-25 and is very utilitarian | While I've heard some complain about the quality of the interior seating and the comfort we've had no problems | We have the YES essentials fabric and I find the seats plenty comfortable have traveled for 3 hours at a time in it | It's definitely not a Lexus but i appreciate that many of the features are so functional | My sister was so impressed by our jeep that she is actually thinking about trading in her 2008 Saturn Vue for one | 
 "words": Great vehicle | Researched Ford Escape and all other small SUV's and the Patriot is the best value even if gas goes up to 5 a gallon | No need for you to repeat my research | Been getting about 21 | 5 mpg on the first tank mostly city driving though | Sharp vehicle with really great handling I can get it into tight spaces | Have your cake and eat it to with this SUV | Can't wait to see how it will perform in the snow | 
 "words": A pleasure to own and drive | Appears well-built have experienced no faults or issues and no minor irritations | I really like the CVT transmission but only with the autostick manual override which allows you to use the engine as a downhill brake and provides for smoother engine operation on a long uphill ride plus a fun component if you are getting bored | Everything being considered I cant think of a better vehicle | 
 "words": Bought my Jeep Patriot in Nov | and at 6000 miles it has been great | Just as tough as the old Cherokees with same styling outside but updated under the hood | Great gas mileage and performs better than most SUVs in snow | Very little wind shear on the highway when it's windy unlike many others | Bit of noise from smaller engine but plenty of pep | Only dislike is Jeep Chrysler playing the maintenance game and requiring plugs at about 30000 miles when many makers go 60000 plus | Also use of a timing belt rather than a timing chain like Suzuki is an expense at 60000 miles that could cost | It boils down to Jeep Chrysler wanting more bucks for the dealer to do more frequent work | 
 "words": I have been extremely pleased with my new Patriot | On a recent trip interstate driving I was shocked to get a little over 28 miles per gallon | The jeep handles well on mountain roads and so far the 4wd has preformed in all situations even though I did not get the Trail-rated editon | The room inside is generous and comfortable | I'm glad I opted for the manual transmission | 
 "words": This car is beautiful | Nice to handle and has a lot of standard options | The stock stereo is nice with 6 speakers | It has a standard Brake assist 6 speakers side air bags aux | port and so much more | Its a lot of bang for the buck | It gets great gas mileage | Its like a mini SUV | it looks small on the outside but it is just as big as as any other SUV on the inside | 
 "words": So after looking at the Chevy Equinox Pontiac Torrent Mazda5 and a few others Jeep had the best lease terms and no doubt the absolute best warranty in the business which led us to lease this truck 1 wk ago | So far so good it's fun to drive with the euroshift making up for it's lack of spunk when passing a little down shifting goes a long way | My own complaints are that it's 2008 and you can still lock yourself out of the car with THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION | I've already done it if you hit the lock down manually by accident while getting out too bad | Also the cup holders are in a stupid spot and the tailgate door is super low | I'm 5'10 and I've hit my head a few times already
 "words": Well you won't win any races with this Jeep | But it is a solid little SUV | In the Texas hill country yesterday and it did very well in the hills with the auto shift | First tank I got 23 mpg | Not bad on the open road | Very smooth at 75 | 
 "words": We needed a new vehicle that would accommodate our two growing children and something that had decent mileage for my 134 mile daily round trip work commute | Honda Fit and other like vehicles didn't offer free safety features such as side impact airbags and A C were considered OPTIONAL | We were floored when we found the Jeep Patriot base model | It offered more room the standard features that we needed really good gas mileage and a fun TONKA toy kind of ride | On this last tank of gas we averaged 26 | 8 MPG | Being in the NOLA area I also wanted something big enough to sleep in if we had to evacuate You get a heck of a lot of bang for your buck with a Jeep Patriot |

 "words": Just bought the Freedom Drive II off- road version a week ago and took it on a camping trip near Moab Utah | Didn't do any offroading just rough dirt roads and the Patriot did great | It got 25-26 mpg on the highways and had no problems cruising at 75 and handling the hills on I-70 | We had been using a minivan for these camping trips and were pleasantly surprised that we could pack all that stuff into the Patriot as it's a smaller vehicle | We have no complaints about the Patriot and that is saying something for us as we tend to be rather picky about vehicles | So this is now our camping mobile and we're very happy with the purchase | 
 "words": Having traded a supercharged Grand Prix for a 4 cyl | 1 | 5 ton vehicle I was a little weary about losing the performance I enjoyed | I was shocked with the performance of the Jeep and bought the vehicle after further review of reliability and economy | It won't be setting any land speed records | however buying a 4X4 setting speed records should be of least concern | The Patriot has 600 miles now and averages 24-26 mpg including 4X4 use from a recent snow | All controls are easily located and the steering wheel controls are very handy since my GP had a similar set up | The Patriot handles like a car but strong winds can push the Jeep | Chose the Patriot for the traditional Jeep look | A Jeep
 "words": I am pleasantly surprised by the quality comfort and performance of this vehicle | Mileage in town is about 23 | 5 mpg and highway hovers around 29 | 5 | In full automatic mode the car accelerates at a moderate pace but using the auto-stick really kicks it in gear | Adequate in-car capacity although I would recommend covering the seat backs if you haul anything that may snag them | Seat comfort and adjustability offer enough range for just about anyone | I am glad I bought this vehicle |

 "words": If the front seats were built better this would be the perfect vehicle | It is the perfect size gets about 25 mpg which is good for a 4wd has great visibility and well designed flexibility in loading the interior | It is a real blast to drive and getting used to the CVT transmission didn't take as long as I expected | So far I have not discovered any factory defects and this Jeep really seems tight no squeaks or rattles | This is built much better than other Chrysler products that I have owned | However the front seats are thinly padded over a hard shell | There are no springs and consequently no give in the seats | Bumps telescope directly to your spine through your tail bone | 
 "words": With the continual climb in gasoline prices my need for a 4WD vehicle for the wintry conditions of New England I needed a rugged yes stylish car to get me to fro work play safely | After searching the market for a compact SUV I stumbled upon the Patriot | I couldn't be happier that I did | The price was right and the design is classic Jeep through and through | The heated leather seats moon roof and standard Sirius Radio on the Limited Edition it was love at first test drive | Easy to maneuver around town and in tight parking spaces but surprisingly roomy on the inside | couldn't ask for a better combination | A definitive mix of spunk and sexy | WARNING Cute-utes beware |

 "words": I was looking to upgrade to an suvand was willing to trade off gas mileage then came along the patriot | I'm not a serious off roader let's face it95 of you with suvs never see dirt but I need to get to the trailhead or ski area over moderately rocky and mucky logging roads with ease | I tested it this winter a few times up some steep mountain dirt roads in deep snow and an ice storm no problem | The engine is still breaking ingetting 22 to 23 mpg mostly around town If you don't need a rock crawler or a super sized suvand you'd rather put your hard earned money in the bank rather than your tank this is your vehicle | With gas approaching 4 gallon I applaud Jeep for thinking ahead | 
 "words": I just got my Dark Green Patriot | Love it | Power is perfect I have no clue why people bash it | I have the 5 speed which is peppy and gets great mileage | My first tank I got 26mpg and I went 309 miles before the fuel light popped on | This lifetime powertrain warranty was the selling point for me | No need to buy the FDII model unless you go off- road a ton | My FD I performs well plus 90 of my time I will be on the highway If you can afford it spring for the 17 wheel package and the moon roof the stock 16 rims are hideous

 "words": Totaled my beloved '99 Cherokee in a crash that could have killed me but I walked away from | Wanted another Cherokee but with better mileage | After reading about everyone's complaints regarding power I test drove a 5-speed manual Patriot | It seems whatever issues people have with lack of acceleration can be blamed on the CV-tranny not the engine | But how can I talk on the phone and sip my latte and drive a manual transmission | You can't | Go buy a Kia | After two months I am extremely pleased with this car | One of my initial reservations about buying it it had everything I was looking for for less was that I wasn't seeing any on the roads | Seems I am seeing more and more each week |

 "words": This is the cheapest 4x4 suv you can find | I got 24 mpg on the first tank | Lots of options and it still was cheap | I can't see myself in a RAV4 or CRV but this one feels like a real truck | 
 "words": Loving this Jeep | Hard to find the negatives about it | For those who want more power and complain that it's whimpy go buy something bigger | It's that simple | But if you are looking for a smaller cheaper SUV and want to park in more places than bigger SUVs then get this Jeep | I recommend this to anyone | Well the limited version anyway |

 "words": I bought my Patriot brand new in April 08 and I love it | Forget what professional reviewers say about it compared to the Escape Rav4 etc | this is comfortable and handles great | Kentucky got hit with a terrible ice storm in early '09 and the Patriot acted like it barely noticed it | The biggest knock on it is the cheap interior materials but seriously how often do you touch your dashboard |

 "words": This Jeep is alright at best it drives well enough however they leak very badly and this is a common problem if you go on any forum | Jeep doesn't seem to know how to solve the problem | Having said this it does drive well and has decent power the interior is comfortable but the dash is very cheap looking plastic which jeep is changing in 2009 | The console also heats up quite a lot where the heat adjustment knobs are | This has potential to be a very good vehicle however Jeep has to look at it and fix the design flaws first |

 "words": If your looking for a car with no power and no flash than here ya go | I have the bare bones model because of the price but wish I would have spent the couple K more for 4WD and added features | The car would be a great commuter and that's it | Far from trail rated it's a Dodge Caliber with a Jeep logo stamped on it | 
 "words": I wanted to write a review because when I was looking for new car automatic the Edmunds' reviews were very helpful | I scaled down from a minivan to a small SUV but really the Jeep Patriot is a modern day station wagon | I wanted better gas mileage and am I getting it averaging 25 mph and on strictly highway 31 mph | That's what should happen with a 2 | 4 liter 4- cyl | engine peppy and ride is smooth enough | Went w out 4x4 to get better mileage | Basic sound system fine | One chip in the paint around the wheel well that's a concern | Since I've only had it a few months I'll try to check back | Status of my extended warranty unsure now but still try to buy American |

 "words": We have been very happy with our Patriot | The Manual 5 speed gets excellent gas mileage averaging 28mpg and even up to 30 | It actually has sufficient power considering its size | You're not going to break any land speed records but it has enough power loaded down to get over both passes from western Colorado to Denver without being stuck behind the semis | The patriot is a great value for the money especially with all the options and the safety features | The only downfalls have been having to take it in to repair a the left turn signal that stopped canceling itself as well as it being a little hesitant to engage in reverse while facing downhill | Cons are outweighed by the pros if it lasts |

 "words": After 33000 miles I traded in my '07 Caliber for this '08 Patriot so I was used to the interior layout though the Jeep is a little roomier and the CVT | I agree that you sacrifice some get up and go for the gas mileage but in these days of 4 | 00 a gallon gas I think the trade off is well worth it | Prior to the Caliber I had an '05 Equinox | The Equinox was a little too large for my needs and the Caliber was a little too small but the Patriot is just right | I feel like the Patriot fills a niche that no other compact SUV does it's an SUV just smaller | not a cute 'ute like everything else in its class |
