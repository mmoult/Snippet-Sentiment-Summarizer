REVIEWS
 "words": I've owned many cars over forty years Sunbeam Alpine Alfa Romeo Spyder MGB and BMW 2002 back when | With a family later I was lucky with more practical fun cars VW GTI and BMW M3 | Last year I bought my S2000 in rich pearlescent Rio Yellow | My wife was worried about the yellow | After she saw it she said it was a perfect color for the shape and character of the car | This is the most eager engaging car I've ever driven | It doesn't isolate you from the road or insulate you from the experience of covering ground | This is the most reliable open-top sports car made | Its instantaneous responses to driver input make it the best performance value available | 
 "words": From the first day I took a test drive I new I was hooked that I had found a true gutsy sports car | I leased my first S2000 Red in 05 and this past July I swapped it for an 08 Laguna Blue beauty | The driving experience the amount of car for the money the continual grin on my face says it all | Honda created a winner with the 2000 and although it's production run is ending in this model year 09 this car will live on as one of the few remaining true sports cars on the road today and one which I will own till I give up my license due to old age | 
 "words": This car is a poor man's world class car | Fantastic handling hard acceleration and great build quality combine with bulletproof mechanicals to make what I feel to be the greatest package for the money | This car looks like it could cost twice what it does | I can park this car next to nearly anything else on the road and not feel in the slightest way inferior |

 "words": Worth every penny | It's probably not for everyone as the ride is a bit on the harsh side | Actually harsher than my Miata but that's probably due to the Honda feeling stiffer overall | However the payoff comes in the first corner you take | The engine is amazing | The sound is unbelievable | The best gearbox I've ever driven | All in all I'm very happy with it but might've liked a variable suspension setup to soften the ride a bit in town | I'm getting old 8

 "words": I just traded in an '06 base Corvette on an S2000 | I thought I might miss the 'Vette but after almost 2000 miles on the little drop-top I can honestly say that I'm thrilled with my decision | The Honda feels like it is glued to the road | handling is incredible much better than the Corvette | The S2000 isn't as fast as the Chevy | But it's quicker than my 350hp 2005 Daytona Charger RT was and faster than a base Boxster | Push hard through a curve and the little Honda simply begs for more | and the F1 bark of the engine at 6k RPM is a hoot | Fit and finish are impeccable | There's no downside to the S2000 if one uses it for what it was designed a true absolutely uncompromising sports car

 "words": If you want a fun car this is it | However it is NOT an every day car | I have owned several sports cars the last being a 350z | The S2000 is much more fun than the Z has a better road feel and is easier to drive | However the inside is tight and there is not much leg room | If this is your 3rd you will want to drive it often | However if this is your primary car you will wish it had more room | 
 "words": Beware to all the CR is only for the track | If you are thinking about it for a daily driver or even a weekend getaway car get the regualar S2000 | I drove it less then eight miles on a standard road felt like I went 10 round with Mayweather giving me kidney shots | If you are going to use it for what it was made for track you'll have a blast | 
 "words": A practical sports car | I've owned and driven true sports cars such as the MGB and Fiat X-19 | As all true sports cars are supposed to be they were cramped noisy with no room for luggage in short highly impractical but a blast to drive | Here is a true sports car in every sense with high-tech handling and more power than all but the most experienced sports car guy can handle | The S-2000 has changed little but when you've approached perfection why mess around | Honda pays attention to critics | Although HP numbers have evolved downward slightly the mid-band torque is now just right | 50 50 balance a bit light in the rear for traction but great handling |
