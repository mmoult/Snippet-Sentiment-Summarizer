REVIEWS
 "words": I was looking for a nice truck that was fully loaded but wasn't too large | After comparing all of the models available I noticed that the smaller almost car-sized trucks were comparable to price of the Dakota | After taking it for a quick test drive I immediately noticed that the V6 Magnum had the power that could be used if needed | Great interior almost nice enough to be considered luxury and all the features you could ask for | Great ride all in all | I average 18-22mpg combined which isn't too bad for a truck this size | Towed my 16 foot 1500lb boat with no effort | Nice stock stereo system | New design for the exterior makes the truck look much nicer | Great truck for the money | 
 "words": I wanted a truck that wasn't too big but had enough grunt to work | Love the space the crew cab gives wish the bed was about 1' longer | 4 | 7 V-8 is a great engine in search of a decent transmission | Very slow to down shift yet won't up-shift in parking lots | 4X4 knob is in a poor location | Ride is a bit too stiff the 07 was too soft | Handling is terrific for a truck but I would trade a bit of handling for a less stiff ride | So far 14 mpg city 21 mpg highway pretty decent for a 300 HP V-8 4X4 | Overall head and shoulders above the Ranger and Colorado better looking than Toyota and Nissan | Best mid-sized truck out there
 "words": I reseached this purchase before spending 27K and nothing compared to the value received in the Dakota | Oh yes all the magazines love Toyota and Nissan however these same magazines receive a heck of a lot more incentives from these manufacturers for the positive take | This Dodge is every bit as good more powerful more capable and better looking | Take advantage of all the incentives compare and you'll come to the same conclusion -Buy it | You won't be sorry | 
 "words": This is my 3rd truck in 5 years and I must say my favorite | I bought the v6 because I drive so much and its better on gas | Love the looks of this truck and the interior is like a luxury car | Never liked the exterior of the Dakota till the 08 came out | They are giving 08's away mine was 10k off MSRP | The quad cab is very roomy drives and handles way better than my 06 Titan | This is the top of the small truck class | I looked at and test drove a Canyon Z71 and a Nismo Frontier and I was surprised that I liked The Dakota so much better | 
 "words": I was in the market for a pick-up and researched for a year | Settled on the Dodge Dakota with V8 | I like the size and power | Meets my needs for a vehicle that supports my fly fishing weekend camping towing small trailer | I bought for Sport Crew Cab with V8 for 26800 freight and tax included | Sticker was close to 34K | Bought at 1000 under invoice plus Dodge is offering factory 5000 rebate on 08 Crew Cabs | 
 "words": Having done the research for a bigger engine to pull with I decided on the SLT V8 4WD with 4 doors | Like the new design for exterior and upsized engine | Lots of power and average MPG is around 17 | 5 with the auto | transmission | First thing I noticed was trailer lights not working properly | A computer glich | This turned out to be a small recall | The truck came with a trailer harness when purchased | Now the blower motor quit and the interior lights | A wiring cluster behind the dash for the odometer has my HVAC wiring running through it | Why would they run a 40 amp fan through this | I've been driving Toyotas since 1983 | Considering going back to Toyota before my warranty expires | 
 "words": Just bought my Dakota | Love it | I Love the off-road capability the looks style | Even it's 3 | 7 L v6 performs great in towing off-roading etc | 
 "words": Just picked up my 08 Dakota | Turned in a Ram for this little beauty | Very impressed with the looks interior and drive-ability of this truck | This is a very capable truck in a smaller package | Very easy for the wife to maneuver in traffic | Vehicle fit and finish is excellent | Better on gas than my old Hemi | Interior is very quite and the upgraded stereo is very crisp and clear | Really like the Sirius radio option | Had an issue finding room to store all my gear from the Ram | Solved by mounting on of the collapse-able bins from interior to the truck bed with sheet metal screws | 
 "words": Originally was going to get the 07 at the end of the year | But after hearing about the new V8 I waited | I was not disappointed power is very good | MPG could be better but is OK at about 16 | 5 average | I like all the storage but dash looks and feels like cheap hard plastic | Cab has a lot of wind noise but with stereo on it is not noticeable | Ride is stiff and bouncy very noticeable while going around a turn with bumps feels like the back end is going to lose traction | I have the Sport and it should have been set up to look sportier like the Colorado with a lowered stance | Front seat only holds 2 people while my older model holds 3 3 would be better | Stock rear tinted windows are dark | 
 "words": My truck is actually a Sport w V-8 crew cab | This is my 3rd Dakota | So far my favorite | It's red fast looks sporty handles great rides good doors open wide seats firm and supportive tows looks good anywhere best warranty of anyone | Traded down from full-size Chevy | Like this better | Easier to get in and out of and wife likes the size | Mileage is 21-24 on highway driving sensibly | City is lower of course | Acceleration is matched by nothing else is its' class | Brakes and transmission work flawlessly | When you turn on your truck does it return the favor | Mine does | 
 "words": Did some research on this truck and the ratings I read are true | My mpg on highway at 71 mph at 65 degrees little wind is around 19 mpg the truck had 65 miles on it | The V8 has some good power | Got the Laramie package with the trailer tow package | Truck pulls 3000 lbs real good | Love the black metal flake paint with the chrome front end looks like a Harley truck | Truck gets a lot of looks Dodge did a good job on redesigning the front clip | Ride is pretty good for a pickup truck | 
 "words": After having a Honda and a Toyota I find my new Dakota to be their equal in terms of build quality | In fact I drove a Ridgeline and a Tacoma on the same day I drove the Dakota and the Dakota blew them away in terms of quietness and ride quality | The 08 interior is an upgrade from the previous year | I have the V8 which I need for towing and so far MPG is not the greatest 14 around town18 HWY but it should improve once it breaks in and the weather gets warmer | The new engine has a lot of guts and will serve my needs very well | So far I love my truck
 "words": I looked at all th mid small pickups | My father-in-law owns a Colorado | I have driven many of my friends' pickups and none compare to the Dakota | Better ride and definitely more fun to drive | The new redesigned suspension is a bit stiff giving it a tighter feel but it is still better than the Nissan Chevy and the Ford | The Toyota rides a little better but the Dakota even with the V-6 Auto has better passing ability | Gas mileage is OK I am getting about 22-23 MPG in mixed driving | Overall I am very pleased I chose this truck and I look forward to many years of enjoy my time behind the wheel | 
 "words": It has a firm borderline stiff ride much less spongy than the previous model years | We have many 2006-07's in our fleet and you can tell the difference | The console and cup holder layout is great and much improved | All controls are easy to reach and use | The ride is quiet | I would recommend the V8 if you need serious power | So far my 3 | 7L accelerates good enough and maintains highway speeds adequately | We have had very few quality issues in our fleet so far with Dakotas and hopefully this series will even be better |
