 "words": This is the best full size suv on the market today | Buy the 5 | 7 380 plus HP engine for the incredible acceleration and the better gas mileage than the 4 | 7 litre | The interior in the limited is awesome with illuminated dash similar to Lexus and hands free bluetooth phone system | The truck rides like a Bentley for 1 4 the cost | 
 "words": Needed something larger and wanted to be able to tow about 7000 lbs | This looked to be the right mix but we had concern over first year and whether it was all it appeared on paper | Was looking at either an Expedition Armada or the new Sequoia | The Seq rear axle is all new and very capable but new design for Toy and a little concerning so I hope for the best there | But we think we made the right choice | Power is very smooth and ample for this huge SUV | It is wider then a Suburban | Drives sturdy and handles very well | Brakes stop very well | Very quiet engine compared to the other SUVs in class | 
 "words": I've owned this vehicle for less than 24 hours and I have only driven it home from the dealership but that's 50 miles of everything from Interstate to rough dirt roads and winding washboard mountain byways in between | On and off pavement dirt snow and ice I have never become so comfortable so at home felt so secure and in command so quickly in my almost 50 years behind one wheel or another | Also I have never been in a car truck that was so thoughtfully designed with the American motorist family in mind | Fuel Economy and reliability just guesses at this stage With apologies to Field of Dreams and Iowa Is this heaven | No | This is a 4WD Platinum Sequoia |

 "words": This is my second Sequoia the first is now in my daughter's hands and she loves it I got the '08 when she got my old one and although it took a little getting used to it's a superior vehicle to any other SUV I've owned Ford and GM | The features of the Platinum trim line include the backup camera reverse tilt mirrors and more | We tow an 8500 LB travel trailer with ease great vehicle | 
 "words": I was interested in the Sequoia before the redesign and after seeing the new 2008's it moved to top of my list | We got the Limited edition and added the dual headrest DVDs with 2nd Row bucket seats | I could not be more happy with this car | It is primarily my wife's and she goes on and on about how much she loves driving this car | It has an incredible turning radius for a car of its size and drives very quiet and smooth | For long trips the ride the navigation and the rear DVDs make traveling with our 3 year old and 3 month old a breeze | 
 "words": I needed a full size SUV that had trailer towing capacity that gave me room to play when towing a boat | I have had Toyotas in the past and though always scant on creature comforts have been extremely well made and reliable | My last clocked in at 450000 km and only died due to an accident | Issues IPOD connectivity useless to non existent | Don't bother with the Toyota cable | Navigation package useless | Very error laden extremely user unfriendly better to buy an aftermarket system | A 150 garmin will outperform the Toyota navigation | Gas cap has no lock | Oil changes uses a cartridge filter that few aftermarket dealers have | Dealers even hate doing changes | 
 "words": Love this truck bought it 500 miles ago | I had a Ford expedition that I got rid of when gas hit almost 5 | 00 a gallon | I went to a Cherokee sport which was just as bad then I went to 2009 Toyota matrix which was beautiful on gas but I was very unhappy with the limited space | 10 months later I traded in the matrix for the sequoia best investment I made | I don't care if gas hits 10 | 00 a gallon it's worth it if you put super you can get about 14 miles a gallon in the city | 
 "words": Traded in my wife's Ford Explorer Sport for the Sequoia Limited 4wd and it was the best thing we ever did | Before purchasing the 2008 Sequoia we test drove the Escalade Tahoe 2006 Sequoia and Expedition XL for a weekend each and the 2008 Sequoia was the clear winner | The Sequoia ride quality and handling ability is excellent | even in 4 wheel drive | Our regular ski trips to Lake Tahoe have been a lot more comfortable and fun since we got the Sequoia | 
 "words": I purchased my 08 Sequoia last Jan 09 after 3 days the headliner rattled the headlamp washer cover discolored | After 4k miles the exhaust manifold cracked | Interior very plasticky and hollow | 
 "words": I purchased the 2008 Platinum Sequoia for family and weekend road trips | I test drove the Escalade ESV Suburban and Expedition XL | I chose the Sequoia with very little deliberation | The ride is smooth and the options are top rate | I love the interior space the only two complaints I have are the lack of chrome accents for a model labeled platinum and the navigation and radio system | The resolution on the nav system is poor and the text limitation on the radio is just ridiculous for a product from Toyota | I know the profit margins had to be huge because they did not invest a lot of money to impress customers or be competitive with 150 Nav systems from Best Buy | 
 "words": Traded in Odyssey loved it to get a SUV that would fit our family of 6 and tow our 4500lb boat | The Sequoia w 5 | 7L has plenty of power on tap even more torque | It accelerates better w boat in tow than my 2002 Tundra V8 did w no boat | Ride is good for a SUV but definitely not minivan smooth | Ergonomics are pretty good but cups controls hard to reach even w my long arms | Like the high ride height visibility | Middle back rows easily fit 6' passengers w leg-room to spare | Avg 16-17mpg which is good for large SUV in town w this much power | 
 "words": I only had the vehicle for 763 miles before a metal piece dropped on the floor as I adjusted my steering column | Now the steering column moves up and down and can not lock into place | The service people wanted me to wait 2-3 weeks for an appointment | Would you drive a car like that | I said no | Toyota Quality |

 "words": The ultimate large-size luxury SUV | Period | 
 "words": You may as well buy this one | Don't let some of the magazine reviews turn you away from buying this gorgeous vehicle | I mean let's face it is there a halfway decent car out there that has room for the whole family AND gets good gas mileage | The simple answer is NO | My 2008 Sequoia is a smooth smooth ride and mine spends its time on Boston roads which are some of the worst pothole infested roads in the country | Some reviews say that the steering is too easy and coming from a 4runner I can see what they are saying but if the Sequoia had a Lexus badge they would be complementing its effortless steering instead of trying do equate it to a Chevy Silverado | 
 "words": I really like the Sequoia | It really met all my family's needs | We didn't buy it for the GREAT gas mileage HAHA | This is our family car | Everything is great except for the poor gas mileage | 
 "words": I chose the Sequoia because I did the research and read a lot of comments posted on this very website | I am very pleased with the Limited 4X2 | The ride is what I expected but even better | I love the turning radius when once was disappointed with the Tundra radius | The Sequoia is very sleek in it's interior design | It is very spacious and love the tri-climate control | Gas mileage is about 16-18 hwy | The body is huge and the front end takes some getting use to when it comes to parking | I am very happy I went with an SUV as a long time truck person I am pleased | 
 "words": Needed large SUV so we drove Expedition Tahoe and Sequoia | Great deals on all | Features very similar but the quality and execution of the Sequoia is superb | This vehicle is designed to Lexus standards and it shows | Engine is strong and trans is great | Fast quiet and both my wife and I are fighting to take it | Just had six in it and they all loved it | Drives like a smaller vehicle and is easy to park | 
 "words": 2008 Sequoia Platinum slate w red rock interior laser cruise and DRL the only options | I've already filled it with stuff twice and am amazed at how much fits with rearview mirror still usable | Interior reconfiguration is so simple and easy | 400 lb-ft of torque is always evident and handling is surprisingly good in the sport mode | In soft mode 85 on a smooth interstate feels like 70 | The seating position and front visibility are great but there are blind spots behind the large front pillars | You get the same huge center console as the Tundra designed for people using their truck as an office | 
 "words": We drove our new Sequoia to Sequoia National Park for our first outing with the new vehicle | During this drive we experienced driving in city open freeway mountain roads and icy roads | The entire drive was very smooth | The 6-speed automatic engine was far better than our previous 4-speed domestic luxury SUV | It handled very well in all conditions | The interior of the car has more plastic than I normally like | Needs a little more wood trim and some plastic mouldings are loose | Navigation system was excellent | The ride with the air suspension was very comfortable and the steering wheel was steady over all the bumps | 
 "words": I have had my Sequoia about two months | I went all out | Got the red- rock leather interior navigation DVDs in the headrest etc | My family and I love this SUV | The ride is so smooth and quiet | The leg room for all seats is wonderful | Love the heated and cooled seats | I think once you play around with the navigation it gets easier to control | 
 "words": We traded our 2002 Suburban for the Sequoia in Jan | 2008 | With three kids and three dogs we loved the automatic third row and hatch | It drives and parks like a dream | Within 6 months tho the a c smelled like mildew | After four LENGTHY visits to the dealership who found mildew on the filter multiple calls to Toyota we purchased the extended warranty we are extremely dissatisfied with the customer service | There is a constant clicking noise under the cage the hatch does not close all the way and the dealer could not solve any of the problems | The navigational system cuts off when driving so passengers cannot enter the info | Our TomTom is more well designed | 
 "words": I have had the vehicle for over six months now and it is flawlessly executed and easy to drive smoothly even if it never hides its size | But there is a glaring flaw that might get me to return it when the lease is over Cargo space | You buy a big vehicle like this if you have a big family so the third row is always in use | Cargo space is minuscule behind that row barely a foot of floor with the seatback angling back taking away space as you move up | If the vehicle were 18 inches longer all of it in the trunk it would be perfect for its mission | 
 "words": We bought the Toyota Sequoia Limited 4WD to replace a 2006 Land Rover LR3 HSE | We have not regretted it | Pros Strong engine quiet smooth ride reclining seats throughout vehicle window shades leg room for adults in all seats | Cons Navigation system is not user- friendly radio controls are hard to reach have to stretch while driving | Kids love legroom and reclining seats | Wife loves safety feeling power rear hatch and power | I love flexibility for storage and comfort on road trips | 
 "words": We had an 03' loved it | We drive this vehicle everywhere and love it | We bought the sr5 model and added leather blue tooth t | v | system | We have a rattle in the back unless one of the kids is sitting back in the second row of seats | So much improvement over the last truck | With 4 kids and a screaming stereo you cannot even tell that they are with you | 
 "words": I've been a truck suv guy all my life | When it became time to put down my Chevy Suburban I began diligent research to find it's replacement | Without question this is the best large SUV all around for the money | Go ahead and shop Chevy Ford Caddy GMC M | Benz and most importantly DRIVE THEM | Toyota has them all beat in quality and reliability and performance | While M | Benz has an edge on interior luxury it lacks in ALL other categories when compared | Sequoia is unbeatable as a family vehicle especially if you plan to take long trips or tow a boat or camper | What it lacks in the bling factor it more than makes up for in the cha-ching factor financially it makes good sense | 
 "words": By far this is the best SUV on the market not just for the buck but for the features | So much interior room | The platinum edition feels like owning a Lexus with out the huge payment | 
 "words": It is the first truck we own | Drive very comfortable and good mileage | We took 2 trips to the same road to test out the mileage | First trip fill up with Sheetz gas and got 17 | 8 mpg avg | Second trip fill up with Sunoco gas and got 18 | 4 mpg avg on the computer display | Wonder why so much different | It must be the quality in brand gas and no brand | Over all it is very good truck and highly recommend to new buyer | 
 "words": With a need to haul people and tow a boat big SUVs are my family's only option | I have spent a lot of time in all the competing big SUVs | With the changes brought to the Sequoia in 2008 I now feel it is the best vehicle in its class | Love the fold flat third row and the ride and handling are as close to 'sportscar' as you can get in a big vehicle like this | The 'wish list' includes some gps computer oddities but the engine ride handling utility are unrivaled | The bluetooth audio temp controls on the steering wheel are excellent and totally negate the need to reach for the main controls strewn across the dash | Some gps phone features are unavailable while driving in the name of safety
 "words": We all know how the Sequoia drives under normal conditions but hook up a travel trailer and enjoy it even more | Our fully loaded Limited includes the air bag suspension which keeps the vehicle level without having to transfer additional weight to the front end | After a weekend outing to the Oregon Coast I was very impressed with the power this rig has | The combo with our 29' Tango was no match for climbing or descending the Oregon Coast Range | The transmission shifted with ease while in the tow mode and is simply a workhorse | The Sequoia handled better than any other truck trailer combo I have driven over the last 15 years | 
 "words": We just purchased our Sequoia two weeks ago and love it | We shopped around and took a look at the Tahoe and Escalade to compare it to | The Escalade was about 25k more and a lot worse on the mpg | Workmanship of the Tahoe had a poor feel and look to it not to mention poor resale value | We had a 2004 Toyota 4 Runner and loved it but were running out of space and decided to move up to the big boy | We can actually fit 3 more adults into the Sequoia over the 4 Runner comfortably | We opted for the SR5 4 X 4 with most of the options that come on the Limited edition but without the additional | We actually paid a little less for the Sequoia then we did for the 4 Runner almost 5 years ago | 
 "words": We recently let go of our 04 Suburban | Our concern was the loss of room | We knew from experience our 04 simply did not have the craftsmanship to rival our new Sequoia's life expectancy | The features are well thought out and intuitive | The conveniences have become necessities so don't skimp on these if you appreciate luxury | We needed all the features plus the room so save the addt'l 10k stick w the limited | Very smooth ride not sure if the 20 tires make a difference from standard 17 our Sequoia is fully loaded with all the accessories except two-driver seat memory and 4WD | A month in and the Sequoia has a piece of all 7 includes 2 Great Danes of our hearts
 "words": We've had our Sequoia since July 08 approximately 5 months | We are a family of 4 | My husband myself and our two children both under 4years | We purchased the limited black exterior with tan interior | Our sequoia has everything except for nav and dvd | Things we love interior roominess- we can fit two carseats and a full sized adult in the second and third rows | This never happened in our old suv | All three rows recline | In the second row each seat moves individually | So if the middle person wants to recline they can do so without bothering the other two riders | My husband now wants to trade his corolla S for a similar riding Tundra | 
 "words": When I first looked at the new Sequoias I thought that they would drive like a monster however when I test drove it it was so smooth and the transmission shifted without me even noticing it | You could tell that this vehicle was well engineered and geared towards people who want a large SUV but without the truck like feel to it | The Sequoia is driven primarily by my wife but I always find excuses to drive it on the weekends and we do all of our trips in it | Its a great vehicle and I strongly recommend it | 
 "words": I use the Sequoia for business and family travel | The family travel is primarily to horse shows | We pull a two horse trailer with two horses and the Sequoia does a great job of pulling 5000 pounds | It also has plenty of room for our tack and provisions for the trip | The ride is extremely comfortable for all passengers | 
 "words": If you need room for a large family enjoy traveling in silent comfort at barely legal speeds and do not worry about a high gas bill this is the vehicle for you | Seems readily apparent that the Lexus engineers had a hand in designing all aspects of this versatile family hauler | 
 "words": This family SUV is very nice | I traded my 03 Sequoia which I like | What I like the most is the safety features this vehicle have and off course the 5 | 7L engine very responsive and fun to drive | It is also more roomier cargo especially if you have the 3rd row folded | 
 "words": I usually do not acquire first year mfg | vehicle unless its from a top tier car mfg's | Toyota did a fine job this beast and I mean beast drives very smooth and taught with tremendous power room and accessories that very much fits my taste | Exterior and interior is well appointed while at this same-time it provides a not too girly look | 
 "words": I bought my Sequoia just over a month ago due to finding out that I will be having another child | I absolutely love driving it to bad it is primarily my wife's vehicle | I recently had to make a trip to NC from NY and decided to take the Sequoia to see how it did on a long drive | The MPG was great for it size it averaged 19-20 on the highway | The ride was extremely smooth and I did not have to crank up the radio to hear it over the road noise | I only gave a 8 for comfort due to the fact that my wife who is 5'2 has a hard time reaching the pedals and being relaxed at the same time | There is also an annoying little squeaking noise coming from the back seat somewhere | 
 "words": Wonderful car | We might end up with two in the garage | Big and spacious for my four kids | My wife said the other day she is afraid to step on full throttle because it seems it might go on its rear wheels | it's fast | It's quiet visibility is great and very comfortable to drive even long distances | I've never driven all the way from Phoenix to L | A | without my wife helping part of the way but last June I did both to and from | Haven't had any problems so far however I have a small rattle on the moon-roof which disappears when I go to the dealership | Don't keep your eyes on the gas-gauge though you might be disappointed but I expected it when I bought the car | All in all I love it | 
 "words": We've been needing a family car for awhile now with 2 kids and 2 dogs | Finally bought this tank | Man we've been loving it | Comfy tons of room very quiet drives great and the turning radius is excellent for a car this size | Lots of storage even when the 3rd row seat is up | I really like the 6 speed Steptronic shifting takes a little getting used to but once you do it's fun AND it's more fuel efficient and the full automatic mode keep the RPM low | Overall MPG after about 300 miles 15 | 5 | I would imagine that once the engine is broken into more and my wife gets used to the Steptronic getting 16 mpg wouldn't be out of reach | 
 "words": I got this for the family and work | Got it with all the bells and whistles | Love the Red Rock leather | Comfortable ride | Not bad gas usage for a V8 | Very comfortable ride with a vehicle height adjustment for when stopped and loading unloading | Acceleration a little slow but manual option allows for better acceleration control | Looked at Escalade Yukon Mercedes Benz and decided this was best bang for the buck | Also handling steering seems better and quality is good | Interior better looking than the GM cars | Also back seats automatic and fold flat unlike the GM cars | Storage minimal when using all 7 8 passengers but most SUV's like that | Perfect for 4 person family | 
 "words": I can't believe I paid more for my 02 Sequoia with less options than my 08 | There was never a problem with my old one | I just couldn't resist upgrading to the current year and boy what a deal | The power the comfort the features the Toyota reliability and then the price | It has the only excellent editor rating which I was skeptical but hands down definitely the best buy if you're in a market for this type of SUV | Do your research test drive them all check the price and the reliability | Why pay twice as much for a Land Cruiser or a Lexus LX | BTW this Sequoia is made in the USA |

 "words": This is my first large SUV | I traded in my 2007 Mitsubishi Outlander XLS for the Sequoia SR5 | And I am very happy with it | I feel like the king of the road | I compared it to GMC Chevy Nissan and Mazda and the Sequoia stood out more to me with better engine performance 381 hp | 401 lbs torque wow better mpg interior quality comfort and better looking than most | Just buy it you wont regret it | 
 "words": The power option for folding the third row seats is GREAT | Now if Toyota can just apply that same option to the second row seats it would be outstanding | Having three large dogs coupled with a knee injury it makes adjusting the second row seats difficult | The power option would be a huge help in this arena | Think disabled we rarely do until we ourselves are in that situation | 
 "words": Overall it's been a good vehicle | While most people are aware of what they're buying and all of the features that go with the vehicle at the time of purchase some necessities become apparent after your ownership experience gains tenure | 
 "words": Owned a '97 4 runner and was extremely pleased but needed something bigger to carry family to and from AAU Girls National basketball tournaments | Looked at all the competition and frankly they were no match for the Sequoia in my opinion | The interior design and comfort is far superior to all the others especially in the rear seating area | The buckets in the second row are fully adjustable and also recline which made it great for the rear passengers | Not difficult to handle around town and it's performance is well outstanding | Recent long trippassengers were very comfortable | Gas mileage low but not why most will buy this vehicle | The Platinum has all the goodiesadd entertainment system

 "words": Wanted a lux SUV for kids n stuff | Drove all the rest from cad to H2 infiniti MB and chose this hands down | Supple smooth and quiet ride with lots of power | Although the Toyota doesn't have bling factor it is true luxo where it counts ride handling smoothness and over all great use of interior space | Very comfortable 2nd and 3rd rows and easy to get into 3rd row | Overall our family is very happy with our choice of this comfortable fun and functional SUV | 
 "words": I have a '92 Camry that I bought new 16 yrs ago and a '99 Sienna I bought new 9 yrs ago so I expected the Sequoia to be another quality Toyota and 1100 miles into this new vehicle I have not been disappointed | We have driven through the Appalachian mountains twice and it rides wonderfully | With three growing children and a lot of long trips planned we wanted something bigger than the Sienna for these trips | Over a 6-month period I evaluated the Navigator and Armada and had to go with the Sequoia due to my personal experience with Toyota quality the past 16 years | We look forward to getting at least ten years out of this vehicle | 
 "words": Love my 2WD 5 | 7 L SR5 Sequoia | It is everything that the reviews say it is | Very large vehicle yet handles surprisingly well | Easy to corner and park | Tons of power | Struggles with MPG in town obviously but really does surprisingly well on the highway | Sweet spot on the highway is about 68 for my Sequoia | Put the cruise on around there and I consistently get 22-23 MPG which is great to me | My SR5 came with a leather upgrade and the quality is very high | Very happy so far with my purchase
