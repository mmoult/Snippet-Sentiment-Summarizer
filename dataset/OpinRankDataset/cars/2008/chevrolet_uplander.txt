REVIEWS
 "words": Overall a good van | No frills at all | Just good reliable transportation | Ours was purchased used with 12000 miles on it | Price was super great so we could afford it | 
 "words": This van has been nothing but problems since the day we bought it | We have kept it 8 short months and are trading it in today | The sensors continue to fail the air leak in the front window poor braking system lack of interior style and comfort | I am a Chevy GM guy but it's time to switch to a Town and Country | GM was smart by dropping this van | Trading it in while it's still under warranty so whoever gets it can get all the problems fixed under the bumper to bumper warranty | 
 "words": After reading all the horror stories about this vehicle and its brothers I bought one anyway because I love the body style and the ease of entry for passengers and I was able to talk the dealer into 500 for an additional 4 year 48000mi bumper to bumper warranty | I will be back to report on my ownership experiences as they occur but I want to start by saying I have just driven about 600 miles from Portland to Sacramento and averaged 24 | 7mpg 65mph average with about 200 passenger | The driving was a breeze and the support of the drivers seat was excellent | No tired back or legs arrived fresh and happy | Keep your fingers crossed for me | 
 "words": It was a rental van | Its fully loaded and so nice to drive | I drive alot for work and bought it just as a work van to haul things or to take groups to different meetings | 
 "words": We loved our 9 year old Venture but had to replace it | The Uplander LS lacks some of the comfort features we took for granted but it's a good follow-on | Missing are the swing out electric powered windows at the far rear as well as a front seat storage drawer and other storage spaces the Venture had | All the seats are not as wide or plush as the Venture but they're not bad | On the highway it's quieter than the Venture and ours gets about 26 MPG | Around town MPG is about the same | Handling is excellent and steering isn't overly sensitive and unforgiving like some SUVs I've driven | Van is great looking and a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": Great value | For the money you could not get anything even close to the roominess and comfort of this vehicle | Gas mileage is terrible in the city but on highway pretty good | That is given by the size of the vehicle | The engine is perhaps too big for the vehicle I would sacrifice the power for better gas mileage | I bought the basic version nothing extra and it is still luxury compare to what the standard was few years ago | Power windows and locks remote heated mirrors OnStar CD and satellite radio | 
 "words": Sometimes we take long day trips and I wanted something that we could sleep in and I found the Uplander | We've taken the seats out put in a full size air mattressvelcroed shades to the windows and have slept comfortably and inexpensively at RV parks | We had an 30' RV needed lots of gas space and I didn't like driving around with a toilet and every rattling | We are average size people 5'4 5'9 enjoy traveling dining out and have created our own little over-night pod | We can even take our dogs with us | When we return home we put the mattress and supplies in a container in the back keep the 3rd row seats in | If we need more passenger room we can always put the second row back in | 
 "words": To start with | The interior design is the worst ever | The seats in the second row are very poorly designedyou cannot recline fully because the seats hit against the interior side wallsthey are too narrow and uncomfortable and lack knee spacethey should also have been made to swivel | The side sliding doors should have sliding windows on themnot fixed windows | The cruise control is totally in the wrong location and when in use is not smooth at all | The cigarette lighter or auxiliary outlet is in a very dumb and dangerous location almost on the floormakes it nearly impossible to use | The rear door is dangerous when openingit will slam you in the face if you are not careful | 
 "words": I saw in another review a claim of 27 | 6 MPG | I was also pleasantly surprised in this area | We have been as high as 27 | 9 | We came out of an HHR and it took some getting used to but this is a damn good buy | The price was very liveable and we have not found any defect so far | It handles well for a van of any type and the ride is very smooth | Good power | I am waiting for winter to see what effects Traction control and Stabili-trac combined will provide | Overall I think it is a well thought out vehicle
 "words": 1st drove this model as a rental car | We liked it so much we bought a new one when we got back from vacation | We had a newer Sedona Minivan and the difference is amazing | While the Kia had good power the Uplander has that and much more | The powertrain is good for the size of vechile | The seats are really comfortable | The interior is laid out well and there are no blind spots | The doors and all seams line up well and the quality of the paint is good | 
 "words": I just bought this vehicle | It was a lease car and I was hesitant to buy it but my wife has been wanting a new car and I got a good deal on it | We immediately took a 600 mile trip in it and I was pleasantly surprised | The fuel economy was pretty good at 27 | 6 mpg on the road | The ride was nice and visibility was good | Haven't had any issues yet | 
 "words": 2 day old van and defrost blower stopped working | Coldest night of the year too | The dealer took care of the issue giving me a rental | The passenger door and fender don't fit at all at the windshield big gap on one side no gap on the other | The dealer isnt sure if it can be fixed | A terrible visual disaster | It is however not limited to my van only as I have seen many Uplanders the same | Also a rough idle sometimes with a gentle surge when I have a foot on the brake | 
 "words": This is the worst vehicle on the roads | The van features poor and ill handling | OnStar is the best feature | I am now trading it in for a New Sienna | Never drive this again
