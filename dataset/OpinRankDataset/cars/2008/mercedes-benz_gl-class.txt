 "words": CONS A MB service tech told me 18 months after I purchased my GL320 that you need a slush fund keep this car on the road addition to the already known cost due to regular service maintenance | Oh | how he was right | I have had the air-suspension module replaced twice | Tires-they are only good for 20-30000 miles and at 1200 for a set of four it gets expensive and let me just add there are only two tires to pick from-the Continentals and the Pirelli | s | Windshield-twice now at 989 | 00 | I love the Bluetooth while driving however it disconnects when the car is turned off and the door is opened | Then you can | t use your phone for about another 5 mins while it | s still disconnecting | 
 "words": I purchased my GL 320 with 115 miles in May | During the 14 months it was in the shop 25 times for repairs | I had the following items fixed or repaired DVD parktronic sensors new struts mystery oil lights battery computer upgrades air temp sensor hatch corrected would not come out of gear sideview mirror pivet replaced and this is only part of the list | I called MB to file a complaint for buy back or compensation with NO LUCK | Several attorneys said they will not deal with MB because they don't recognize they make lemons | We took a loss to get out of this car and avoid lawsuit | BTW maintenance is 450 and tires are 1200 | Tires last 15000 miles | Look around at other cars before buying
 "words": Great performance acceleration handling etc | Considering its weight and size mileage is suprisingly good | usually 18MPG on the highway driving at 70 MPH | It has been fixed now but the rear hatch would sometimes open without any input from the remote | 
 "words": I really like the car | The handling is excellent and so is the fuel economy | The cabin is quite and stays cool even our Arizona summer | There was an issue with the radio that took three tries to fix | Apparently a window switch was interfering with a speaker and causing distortion | The navigation really needs some help so does the i-pod interface | If you have ever used a Garmen you will be frustrated with Mercedes navigation | I have pulled large trailers without problem | After 20000 miles I am planning to buy a 2009 | 
 "words": SUV has been great so far | Fuel consumption has been v | good 23 | 5 mpg avg | so far over 6K miles 26 mpg on longer hwy trips I used to avg | 16 | 5 mpg with my old Sequoia | Seats are very comfortable feel hard at first but are great on long trips | Ride quality is excellent acceleration with the diesel is v | good for a large SUV but be sure to make a cutout if installing non-MB rubber mats otherwise you will limit the travel of the accelerator pedal | Interior is v | nice especially with real leather exterior looks good except a bit minivan- ish from the rear | So far has been reliable except for a problem with the charging of a secondary battery | Main gripes are with stereo nav |

 "words": I've had the wagon for about six months now and it's a good car | I haven't had any problems to speak of | The seats are firm but not the most comfortable I could drag a house down the street with this thing but won't any races and my mileage is excellent avg | 21mpg hwy cty all typical of a diesel | That said everything electric about it is inferior to the domestic wagons | The power lift- gate is slow and doesn't always close the nav | is a pain to use and slow in responding the rain sensing wipers typically do what they want even on a sunny day and the front parking see dead people and want to warn me about it | If you're thinking about a 4wd wagon check out the Flex cool cheap |

 "words": I purchased the Gl 450 4 | 7 Ltr about 1 year ago | It has spent over 2 | 5-3 months at the dealership while attempting to fix electronic problems | While driving the vehicle it would surge and then the warning lights would start lighting up like Christmas | The lights warned of the following failures ABS Air bags to many to name they were all on | Then a big red box on the led would state drive to the dealership immediatly without shifting gears how you do that in an automatic I'm still trying to figure out | We live in an isolated state with few roads and long distances between help | My faith in the Gl is gone | Hope no one else has experienced this | It still looks nice parked in my garage |

 "words": The GL 320 is a very nice carin performance luxury fun safety fuel economy and design | Accelerating onto the freeway it will go faster than a Chevy Suburban because of the 398ft lbs of torque | The luxury amentities are outstanding | Safety we took this car onto a muddy road with ice snow and potholes | Honestly I would rather be in that car than any other | Car looks very nice except the mirrors too small | We got 32 MPG one time on the highway | Car is fun to drive and handle | I have had a lot of problems though | The shock on a rear tire had to be replaced 9000 miles | The computer that tells the low oil and stuff needed to be replaced 11000 miles | Sucked up oil because of a ripped line 7000 mi | 
 "words": This SUV is rock solid yet handles very well for a full size vehicle | The interior is very comfortable and cabin noise is very minimal | If you need seating for 7 this is the flagship vehicle | Vastly superior to the Audi Q7 Burban mini-vans or anything else for that matter | If you want people mover the search is over | I came out of a 2006 GM product that thought the service center was it's second home | Mercedes exudes quality and the dealership personnel treat you better | Quality does not cost quality pays | 
 "words": I picked up my GL450 in June 2008 and it drives terrific | Smooth quiet and comfortable ride | It's really quite incredible | Feels solid but not overly large | Now for the cons terrible fuel mileage averaging 11 mpg in NYC it's a big truck so the drive isn't as sporty as my BMW SUV's | 
 "words": The 2008 GL320 CDI is the best MB I've yet owned out of 4 different models | It is my go-to car for all short errands and long trips | It is very comfortable super quiet safe has excellent pickup we live in the hills has great visability and gets good mileage averaging 20 mpg city hwy | Also in my mind diesels are a better environmental solution than hybrids because of the battery production and disposal issue | Few vehicles with this weight have the same ability to pass other vehicles when you are going 40 mph or faster | We have towed horses and hardly notice the additional weight except for more downshifting and fuel consumption |

 "words": Just had it for about 3 weeks now and it's so sweet to drive | The exterior styling is gorgeous although it is a big car it doesn't look like it | Gas mileage is averaging about 15MPG but hey I guess I knew what I was getting into from the getgo | The V8 engine is very quiet and it seems to be more than adequate to be able to handle the 7000lb weight without any problem | Compared to the X5 I used to drive it's a little mushy in handling but it still a joy | The 3rd row seat is great for my kids the real reason for my purchase | The seats are comfortable all around and there's plenty of interior space |

 "words": It's a Mercedes and it holds up to it's name | I test drove the Range Rover Infiniti QX56 and the Escalade | None of which come even close to comfort and performance | I opted for the GL320 CDI which is the turbo diesel and for an almost 3 ton truck I get between 24 and 29mpgThe Escalade gets between 12 and 18mpg | The interior design is truly stunning and it has more features than you'll ever use | 
 "words": Just picked up the GL CDI last month | So far it was worth the 4 month wait for the CDI | Great value and priced near the ML gas loaded | Just done the second tank and nearing 900 kilometers Canada | Lots of power torque | Great ride | We also have a SL550 | another great MB
 "words": Leave it to MB | They hit the nail on the head with this car | I wanted the CDI but it is not yet available in California | After having owned a Range Rover a 4Runner and a Cayenne I can say this is the best SUV out there | If not for the 911 Porsche probably the best car out there | 
 "words": I have had the car for about a month and could not be happier | I have had a couple of Navigators and looked at it again before buying the GL 550 there was no comparison | Quite simply this is the best driving car I have ever owned or driven | 
 "words": I purchased an Acrtic White GL320 on 10 31 07 | I love the vehicle and overall the fuel economy of the diesel is meeting my expectations | Now that I own both the MB and an '08 Enclave I can honestly say that GM has a winner on its hands | The MB certainly has some enticing things including the diesel offering a firmer ride etc | But dollar for dollar the Buick is pretty hard to beat | If they would simply upgrade the quality of some of their plastics and the fuel economy I would be hard pressed to choose one over the other | 
 "words": Traded from a Yukon XL | I pull a 4000 lb boat and wanted to go greener | 23 mpg my first 2000 miles compared to 15 mpg with the Yukon | And all this Luxury | I bought the Premium 1 pkg Trailer Hitch which is very unabtrusive19 wheel pkgI-Pod Plug Side rails and chrome fog lights | Power and Acceleration are Not an issue with this vehicle | I know there will be a larger diesel engine soon | I will not need it | I find the Ultra Low Sulfur fuel everywhere | 
 "words": Picked up the GL 320 about two weeks ago and couldn't be happier | Got rid of an XC 90 over size and quality issues | Compared to the GL the XC90 feels absolutely asthmatic | Love the power and torque of the diesel | It's a little noisy in first gear but it's no worse than the whine and groan of the Volvo | I drove every full size not giant size SUV and nothing in this class compares to the GL in terms of space and comfort | Getting 23 mpg blended around town is a happy bonus | Drove the V8 | Love the sound and it's faster overall but around town with kids not worth the fuel economy trade off | 
 "words": While we only have 1200 miles on this vehicle the MPG has been very impressive and at no loss in pick up | Average mpg to date is just under 22 and the cruising range is great with a large tank | The CDI has a slight diesel ting to it and you can notice that this is a diesel engine but it is nothing like the competitors diesels | No smoke no loud clanging of the engine and it is very refined | 
 "words": This car has a duo personality smooth and refined around town | yet exilerating on the open road | The ulta wide 21 inch tires complement the suspension dynamics to make it handle like a BMW x5 with out the punishing ride | When you are on a Sunday drive with the family they'll never realize there is 380 horses under the hood | 
 "words": I have driven this car for two weeks and I am as excited as a kid with a new bike | I find it hard to stop and get out of it | The gadget factor is huge but all useful and user friendly | 
 "words": It's a Mercedes and it holds up to it's name | I test drove the Range Rover Infiniti QX56 and the Escalade | None of which come even close to comfort and performance | I opted for the GL320 CDI which is the turbo diesel and for an almost 3 ton truck I get between 24 and 29mpgThe Escalade gets between 12 and 18mpg | The interior design is truly stunning and it has more features than you'll ever use |

 "words": Leave it to MB | They hit the nail on the head with this car | I wanted the CDI but it is not yet available in California | After having owned a Range Rover a 4Runner and a Cayenne I can say this is the best SUV out there | If not for the 911 Porsche probably the best car out there | 
 "words": I have had the car for about a month and could not be happier | I have had a couple of Navigators and looked at it again before buying the GL 550 there was no comparison | Quite simply this is the best driving car I have ever owned or driven | 
 "words": I purchased an Acrtic White GL320 on 10 31 07 | I love the vehicle and overall the fuel economy of the diesel is meeting my expectations | Now that I own both the MB and an '08 Enclave I can honestly say that GM has a winner on its hands | The MB certainly has some enticing things including the diesel offering a firmer ride etc | But dollar for dollar the Buick is pretty hard to beat | If they would simply upgrade the quality of some of their plastics and the fuel economy I would be hard pressed to choose one over the other | 
 "words": Traded from a Yukon XL | I pull a 4000 lb boat and wanted to go greener | 23 mpg my first 2000 miles compared to 15 mpg with the Yukon | And all this Luxury | I bought the Premium 1 pkg Trailer Hitch which is very unabtrusive19 wheel pkgI-Pod Plug Side rails and chrome fog lights | Power and Acceleration are Not an issue with this vehicle | I know there will be a larger diesel engine soon | I will not need it | I find the Ultra Low Sulfur fuel everywhere | 
 "words": Picked up the GL 320 about two weeks ago and couldn't be happier | Got rid of an XC 90 over size and quality issues | Compared to the GL the XC90 feels absolutely asthmatic | Love the power and torque of the diesel | It's a little noisy in first gear but it's no worse than the whine and groan of the Volvo | I drove every full size not giant size SUV and nothing in this class compares to the GL in terms of space and comfort | Getting 23 mpg blended around town is a happy bonus | Drove the V8 | Love the sound and it's faster overall but around town with kids not worth the fuel economy trade off | 
 "words": While we only have 1200 miles on this vehicle the MPG has been very impressive and at no loss in pick up | Average mpg to date is just under 22 and the cruising range is great with a large tank | The CDI has a slight diesel ting to it and you can notice that this is a diesel engine but it is nothing like the competitors diesels | No smoke no loud clanging of the engine and it is very refined | 
 "words": This car has a duo personality smooth and refined around town | yet exilerating on the open road | The ulta wide 21 inch tires complement the suspension dynamics to make it handle like a BMW x5 with out the punishing ride | When you are on a Sunday drive with the family they'll never realize there is 380 horses under the hood | 
 "words": I have driven this car for two weeks and I am as excited as a kid with a new bike | I find it hard to stop and get out of it | The gadget factor is huge but all useful and user friendly | 
 "words": The driving experience has been wonderful | The vehicle holds to the road and basically drives itself | The sensors are an added feature that certainly gives a peace of mind related to safety | 
 "words": This is a truck of excess | All options basically included and it's a pleasure to drive | Also stands out against the GL 450 | So just get this truck and let it ride | 
 "words": The vehicles is similar to the ML in design especially the interior which is an almost exact copy og the smaller ML class | The most annoying thing are the options packages only two or three to choose from | In order to get memory seats I had to spend thousands of dollars on a Premium package with many features I simply didn't want or need such as a sunroof and a Nav system have my own Garmin unit At a time when many manufacturers are increasing options Mercedes have bundled everything together so that the only option you now have is basically 'Take it or leave it' | How ridiculous
