REVIEWS
 "words": Real off-road capability in a world of soft-roaders | This vehicle benefits greatly from Jeep's involvement with Daimler and as a result it's an interesting mix of American and German input | Fuel mileage isn't great overall but I am consistently observing higher than EPA ratings particularly at highway cruising speeds | 
 "words": Purchased used w 12k on the odo | So far it's been great | The 4x4 works great and has already gotten me out of a bind | The interior is very comfortable and usable | The 3rd row does not get used much but it's good to have just in case | I got a flat and while changing the tire was straight forward the steel wheel spare is way too heavy | I'm a big guy that works out 2-3 times a week and had a hard time lifting it up on the studs | Can't find many other faults | Throttle response is on the slow side need brighter headlights | Gas door needs to lock when car is locked | Better gas mileage but it is the V8 and 4wd so 15-16mpg overall is ok I guess | 
 "words": Haven't had the vehicle for but 3 weeks | Bought it used for half the price of what it cost new | It is truly one of the most enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven | I love the look and feel of it | The windows make visibility the best I have ever experienced except for the rear window view when the 3rd row seating is in place | The whole family loves it | We have had vans for most of our family years and wanted to get away from the whole van thing | This was a GREAT choice and I would definitely recommend one to anyone else | There are pros and cons to any vehicle | I believe the pros definitely outweigh the cons in this one | 
 "words": We previously owned a Jeep Liberty and had to upgrade in size | The Liberty was a great Jeep so we decided to stay in the Jeep family | For a family of four the Commander has been awesome | The kids love riding in the third row because their feet reach the floor only suitable for little ones because there's no leg room | The front is very spacious and controls are easily accessible to both the driver and passenger | I don't much care that there isn't much storage behind the third row when it's up but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means | We look forward to our road trip next month because we'll have plenty of room for comfort and storage | Overall we are very pleased with this vehicle | 
 "words": After owning about 8 new jeeps over the past 16 years i was very impressed with the commander | My prior 06 commander had the 4 | 7 V8 and was underpowered | The HEMI is just right | I purchased a loaded overland model as it is truly the ultimate Jeep | The rear camera is helpful especially when using the third seat | It is a very solid vehicle | I like the styling as it reminds me of my first 1993 jeep cherokee country | I average 16mpg and on a round trip to Cleveland from Albany NY my average was 18 | I drove around 70 mph | I really don't know why the press beats upon Jeep products so much | I have found Jeeps to be very reliable safe and fun to drive | 
 "words": I have had all kinds of electrical problems with this car since I purchased it | The dealership was not very helpful | The locks locked while I stepped out of the car and the car was running | They lock and unlock as I am driving | Auto wipers don't work that great and neither does the reverse assistance | The Sirius equipment was faulty | The angle of the windshield makes it very prone to getting hit by road debris I replaced two windshields within six months | The breaks had to be replaced within the year and six months later need it again | I have never had so many problems with a car | The problems returned about six months after repair | No leg room in the middle seat area | 
 "words": Fun to drive and really useful for families | it has many standards that are luxury and useful | 
 "words": Very pleased with the ride and roadability both in the city in the highway | My compliments to for the new re-engineered 4 | 7 and refinement of 5- 45fre autotrans being one of the best rans out there period | The offering of creature comforts is higher than most Benz's | This vehilce is a keeper it tows our flat bed to get the chores done our 24 ft trailer to play a limo for arriving at our favorite dinner spot plenty of room for our family and looks great in our circle drive it does it all | American got it right and Jeep does not go out of style | Gas | I got such a good deal and my driving miles are very reasonable I am just fine | It drives fresh as the day I tested drove it | 
 "words": Have owned 4 other jeeps all great | This one seems good so far except that plastic key design known as Fobik how long do you think it will last and replacement cost is 140 | 00 plus programing of 30 | 00 if you don't do it yourself | Whoever designed it should be sent to Ford or gm | Only other thing is seat backs to high making poor rear view | 
 "words": If you are in the market for an excellent all around vehicle | Do not hesitate to buy a commander | Shop around a little and you will not only get a great vehicle but a bargain in the deal | Do not buy if you are wanting a 3o mpg vehicle | These weigh almost 5500 lbs | But the plus side is how well they drive | Quiet handles very well for its size | Acceleration with 5 | 7 hemi is awesome | Buy the hemi | This thing can accelerate from 50 to 100 in a heartbeat | And is just as quiet and confident at these speeds | The equipment included is awesome | The sound system Boston accoustics is audiophile quality | Go drive a limited or overland with a 5 | 7 hemi for about 100 miles | You will buy 1 maybe 2 | 
 "words": This Jeep Commander Sports 4 x 4 3 | 7 engine is really a fun SUV to drive | Comfortable enough on a bumpy road and never could you hear any squeaking or rattle after a 3400 mileage accumulation | One problem is the backrest it is too high for women with a height of 5-1 2 feet like my wife | The headrest is tilted downwards at it's maximum down level and very uncomfortable for her | Fuel consumption is 17 miles a gallon a gas guzzler ha | Thank God gas is now 1 | 87 gal | here in Chicago | No leaks or water accumulation on the doors as noted by previous 2007 Owners | The 3 | 7 6 cylinder is good enough for the size of the body | Third row seat | That's a plus for an outdoor sportsman like me | 
 "words": I've been a die hard Chevy pick-up guy and I still am but I wanted a vehicle that was plush comfortable all the bells and whistlesbut I wanted it as an Off road capable as I spend alot of time afield hunting and I go into some very rough situations | This Jeep has out performed anything I've ever had and went everywhere the wranglers go except over huge rock that I won't do as I want to keep this for awhile | But steep hills no matter the terrain deep mud or snow this vehicle goes thru like it wasn't there even places my P U could never get thru | And I get there in comfort and quiet | By the way mine is the limited but I have the HEMI and all the bells and whistles | When we it is great
 "words": Well I have had my Jeep Army Green 08 Jeep Commander for about 8 months now and am as happy today with my purchase as I was when I made it | I paid cash got the lifetime power Trane and opted for the lifetime bumper to bumper since I had my last Grand Cherokee for 11 years I figured it would pay off | The Boston Acoustic stereo is fantastic | The sunroof and 2 additional sunroofs in the back seat area are cool kids love them | A C power in back seat helps out and heated leather seats are great looking and comfortable | When we go up the Pocono Mountains it very smartly shifts for steep inclines providing plenty of power with the 6 cyl | 
 "words": We just purchased a new Jeep Commander | I had always driven a small luxury car | The SUV seems huge | To me it is like you took a Hummer and a Land Rover and combined the two | I absolutely love it | It is nice to look at | The interior is designed well | This is my first time to have cloth seats but I love them | They are much better than leather if you ask me especially with the warranty for replacement if they become stained | I can not imagine a more perfect vehicle for a family | The third row seat has gotten some negative reviews but not from me | I love it as well | It is perfect for kids who love to ride in the back | 
 "words": I traded my 2006 Commander Ltd HEMI in for the 2008 Overland HEMI | It has all the bells and whistles so I don't see myself trading it in after 2 years like I always do | Got it with backseat TV | I've driven from NY to VA twice since August | I find that the gas mileage is close to the 4 | 0 and 4 | 7 engines that I've previously owned Grand Cherokee | I arrive at the Maryland House I95 with an 1 8 of a tank | Driving in the city and Long Island I do use more gas | I'm comfortable while driving | The only problem I had was an inefficient catalytic converter which my dealer replaced and no problems since | 
 "words": This SUV is awesome | Sure gas mileage isn't all that great but who ever said you had to have great gas mileage to have a great car is stupid | For me this car is great | It's just me in it most of the time but I have many siblings and this helps me take them around when I'm taking care of them for a while | I average about 19 miles to the gallon so I think they new EPA estimates aren't accurate on that | Don't believe the numbers because that's driving the car like a stupid teen | If you drive responsibly then you'll get about 16 in the city and about 23 on the freeway | Enjoy | 
 "words": So far we love this vehicle | It's the limited 5 | 7l with the Hemi | This thing will move | Very luxurious inside and out | 
 "words": Since the initial purchase of the car May 2007 we have returned the Commander to the dealership 6 times due to the same issue | Leaking into driver and passenger floorboards which has now advanced to leaking into the dashboard | The dealership has worked really hard to try to remedy the issue but to no avail | It is now September 2008 and we had another swimming pool in the car from rain over the weekend | The car is back in the shop | Oh did I mention it was in the shop for the exact same thing last week | Sad to say this has really detracted from our enjoying the car | 
 "words": Purchased my Limited 4x4 w HEMI in 2 08 | Just turned 3900 miles 6 months later | Remember that as it's a clue | Since purchase my brakes have gone out entirely while driving and they replaced the Master Cylinder | The vehicle has totally died engine and electrical on numerous occasions It is in the shop now getting its 3rd ignition system replacement | Beyond that there have been numerous other electrical problems with the MyGig system and Navigation | To date the car has been at the dealer for 37 days and counting since I picked it up brand new a little over 6 months ago | Currently my attorney has written a demand letter to Chrysler for repurchase | It's a piece of junk | 
 "words": I own a Jeep Commander 5 | 7 V8 Limited and try not to drive with the air conditioner on for fuel economy | But I've discovered how you can get cold air out without using the compressor and still get good fuel economy | I have the dual control with a vent dial and fan speed dial | If you turn the right dial to auto and turn the fan speed to where ever want it with the temperatures dials all the way down you will get cool air out but the air conditioner light doesn't come on | I think the dehumidifier is taking the moisture out of the air and pumping out cold air without using the compressor | Give it a try and see what results you get | dr burke | 
 "words": I just purchase a 2008 commander and I am having water leaking through even when I just use wipers the hand rails near window | Going into speakers | Short crackle sound right side speaker don't work | Who knows where water is traveling now | Also when driving can hear wind through windshield | Hard to see through rear window with rear back seats up don't use it | I can't really rate the vehicle to much since it's only been a month so far not good | 
 "words": I have a 2008 jeep commander 4x4 limited 5 | 7 big hemi v8 its power is simply amazing and is very fun to drive | the drive quality is the best even better than my grandmothers 2006 caddy dts and there is no road noise I had a 2007 Nissan Xterra and the commander is by far the better suv on and off road plus better fuel economy | When I drive my commander I feel safe and in control it's a great big safe suv with an ample amount of power thanks to the HEMI | 
 "words": I am very impressed with my Jeep | It's fully loaded and roomy for a single guy | It has a 5 | 7L Hemi with variable displacement engine | On the straight away I drive on 4 cyl in 'power saver' mode and get 24 mpg 50 mph | I've found the sweet spot to be around 1500 rpm if you aren't in a rush to get somewhere it will increase your mpg by 5-10 mpg | I expect after more break in to average 26-28 mpg on regular gasoline | I am happy with my MDE | A few suggestions When taking off when you reach 25 mph 'Resume' cruise control | And run on 1 2 fuel to increase mileage | Use QuakerSlick50 | 
 "words": Impressive | Always inspires other drivers | Envy | Gives you a safe comfortable I'm in control feeling | Ok for married couples but nix for kids | Plush | Right up their with a Caddy but more beautiful and off road | Got the 'Lets refuel America' deal for 2 | 99 the pump for three years or 800 gallons for 2 | 99 per gallon for a total of 2400 gallons | Deciding factor | No telling what gas is going to cost later this year or next and they credit you with the difference | Say 5 bucks at pump you get 201 credited back to your credit card | Money in the bank | Oh they have a May sale going on 2000 1500 Gas card if you push and ask to see 'special' rebate for dealers to give you
 "words": I have the 2008 Rocky Mountain package | It has the 3 | 7 V6 it's a little underpowered but it's not too bad on mpg | On the highway it gets about 20 mpg and in the city 15 | The one thing that I don't like about it is if it rained and there is still some water on the roof and you open the windows the water pours into the truck | It's even worse when you hit the brakes it just pours all over the inside | Thats the only thing I can say is an issue | Everything else is great rides like a caddy and is really roomy | 
 "words": I enjoy this vehicle more than i can say | I miss not driving it I can not wait until lunchtime at work to get in it | I have owned it for three weeks now | I had a Toyota 4 runner before that did not get good gas mileage | It is flexifuel so i can put ethanol e85 gas in it | that was a bonus for me along with everything else it had to offer | I truly enjoy the my gig system with navigation | I get about 15 mpg in city and about 19-21 on hwy | 
 "words": This is our first Jeep | We replaced our BMW 525i with it | My wife needed something for her tradeshows to carry displays | It has plenty of room and is pleasure to drive | We keep our vehicles 15 years and expect this one to do the same | We opted for the lifetime additional warranty that covers everything other than the lifetime drivetrain warranty | 
 "words": It is everything you could ever want from a vehicle | It is the 2nd 08 Jeep Commander in our family | 1 4X4 and this one | The 5 | 7 V8 will never leave you in a tight spot | press the gas and your off | suddenly everyone is in the rear view mirror | The luxury details inside are right there with the best of them | and more | You can spend 80K on a luxury sedan and get half the features this Commander offers | and talk about a smooth ride |

 "words": Our Commander is a replacement to 2 previous Grand Cherokees and a Cherokee | We've been a Jeep family for many years and love the feel and drive of Jeep products | This one surpasses all others | It rides high with excellent front visibility and the seats are very comfy | The engine 4 | 7 gets about 13 mpg around town and about 19 on the roadnot bad for a V8 | and has lots of power | The side air bags are a great safety feature | We heard the Commander might be eliminated in 2009 | This would be a huge mistake as this is the only full size 7 passenger SUV that Jeep offers and is competitive with most larger family type SUV's | Also it is one of the few full size SUV's that is offroad capable | 
 "words": Going from a Toyota to a Jeep makes me realize how far Chrysler still has to go | The Jeep has been reliable and steady through the first 2000 miles but uninpressive | In reality this vehicle should have seating for five not seven | It's just not big enough and because of this the ergonomics of the interior suffer | Instead of competing directly with the Grand Cherokee I don't understand why jeep wouldn't ditch the Durango Aspen and make this their full size vehicle and make it world class | 
 "words": This vehicle is awesome The more I drive it the more I like it | I actually miss it when I am not driving it and we are talking about a vehicle | It is unique looking not like all those crossbreeds currently flooding the market | It is fast and powerfull I doesnt do to well with gas mileage but what to you expect with a vehicle that is around 6k lbs | With a huge 8 in it | It has 330 HP and always in 4 | I have been driving around looking for piles to drive this thing over | It has so much power that nothing is intimidating | The electronics a cool | nav rear monitor sensors automatic window sensors | etc I would buy it again

 "words": I love the Commander | I spend about 2 hours a day commuting in this vehicle and it could not be more fun and comfortable to drive | The rear cargo area could be a little more spacious but it works great for what I need | The Commander is so rich looking inside and out and everyone who gets in it is very impressed |
