REVIEWS
 "words": Bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in even though I know I will take a loss | has tons of cargo space and leg room but the motor works too hard | Doesn't feel like it shifts properly | Not very darty takes a long time to accelerate | Gas mileage for me has been consistently at 18 miles and less | I have never gotten even 19 mile per gallon as stated | 14 gallon tank is small feels like I am always at the gas station | radio and amenities are positioned well for a comfy ride | Great heat and A | C but is hard to hear radio over it not strong speakers
 "words": As much legroom as a Ford Explorer but much better fuel economy | 
 "words": Purchased this SUV after having a 4 cyl 5 speed Sante Fe for 4 years was quite happy with both service reliability with Hyundai vehicles | Was looking for something comparable found the 4 cyl 5 speed Tucson surprisingly similar to drive | Handles very well in the city with great gas mileage | Having purchased a front-wheel drive a good set of snow tires handled winter driving in the snow well | The highway driving is very good but the engine works harder on hills with 4 passengers and a full load which is to be expected | Interior noise is surprisingly quiet for a hard working engine as well as very smooth handling | Recommend this vehicle with anyone with kids | Trunk space is a minimum
 "words": I bought this car last week when my 90 Civic gave up the ghost | My wife and I are just married and we wanted a car we could take the future family and dog camping in | Plus it will be fun for our active cycling lifestyle | I can fit a tandem bike in it with all the seats down | It was also important as this would be a family car that it have good safety features it does | My wife has a 07 Sonata and we love its safety and quality which is why we considered getting another Hyundai | And it rides so very smooth on my 40 mile daily commute | It was priced so competitively that we came in under budget which makes up for the lower MPG | I can live with that now that I have a little more power-v6
 "words": Drove a 6cyl then a 4 cyl and there was very little difference in performance | Car has good space inside controls and features great | I appreciate the safety stuff like traction and stability control and all the airbags | First weekend cruise got 24 mpg mixed bag intown and freeway at 75 | Will update in the future | Like to see more cubby holes for things like cel phone | 
 "words": We live in the outback of New Mexico a mix of bad paved roads and dirt | I've owned a 4-Runner a Tundra a Subaru and a mix of Detroit bummers this small SUV is at the top of the list | We got about 27mpg in the Subaru along with a tough ride | We get a great ride in the Tundra but truck mileage | In the Hyundai we get 30 on the highway and a Tundra ride | and a Tundra sound system AM FM CD Cassette | I hope this one is as long lasting as a Toyota 'cause we intend to keep it as our main ride | I've read the comments about ungainly ride but that isn't my experience at all | In fact this one rides as well as the Tundra which is like a limo | 
 "words": I have owned this little SUV for 15 months now with nary a service problem or defect | I test drove a RAV4 VUE Escape and the CRV | I needed a vehicle that could easily tote my daughter's everyday wheelchair and a sport wheelchair | This SUV is roomy can hold her everyday wheelchair in the back or two medium dog crates w o putting the rear seat down is great fun to drive and the turning radius is good better than Mazda MPV about the same as a Camry not as good as a Volvo or BMW sedan | 
 "words": So far I like the general conservative styling of the vehicle | I have the black interior which gets rid of a lot of the tackiness and cheap feel | Audio is great | Handling is brilliant for a car in its' class | A few blind spots but otherwise vision is good | Space is well used in car although question to the depth of the dashboard could be smaller so that the interior is forward with larger boot | Fuel economy and engine performance is rubbish | Thus far have got no where near what the dealer claimed transmission is horrible it needs 5 gears with better ratios and it loves a drink | You watch the fuel gauge more than the road | Don't get this if you want an economical car | 
 "words": When I decided I no longer needed a pickup I looked at RAV4 and CRV but chose the Hyundai because of price and warranty | I no longer consider American-made cars | The Tucson is roomy comfortable handles well and has great visibility | The 4c engine seems noisy and underpowered to me compared to my wife's 4c Accord but I no longer need those features | I did expect better gas mileage than 24 mpg but that may improve | One bad feature is the light-colored interior which is hard to keep clean | Did not think of that when I bought | I always felt that home carpets and car interiors should be a dark color as people tend to walk on them | Seatcovers and mats help | 
 "words": Although I have had it for a few weeks I love this ride | My previous relationship was a Hyundai Elantra and that alone convinced me that this was a firm purchase and solid vehicle | I love the way it handles and the space on the inside | Any compact car owner could transition comfortably into this vehicle | I am trying to convince my husband to get the Santa Fe which is the 2nd gen of the Tucson | I am totally in love with this vehicle | 
 "words": Very sharp turning circle | Entire vehicle well constructed | Firm ride but sporty | Gas mileage so far for mixed driving is 23-25 mpg | Good view of road and the rear | Nice high driving position | Quiet for a 4 cylinder | 
 "words": Only 800 miles so far | Firm ride but sporty feeling | Can see well out of the vehicle | Seems well constructed | Mixed gas mileage so far 24-25 mpg | Nice short turning circle | 
 "words": Great car great price room galore | Quite solid ride | My insurance went down 240 a year because of the safety features | Traded in my 2007 Patriot with no regrets | Tucson has larger storage area more comfortable seats and sits higher | Very good mileage for this type of vehicle in a 4 cyl | A 4x4 will use more gas | 6 cylnot worth the trade off for the difference in horsepower and mileage | Trailer hitch can tow small loads from the home centers | It is a heavy vehicle with the front wheel drive 4 wheel isn't needed if you're not an offroader | Quieter then the Rav4 | Switched to synthetic oil increased mileage slightly | Still breaking in average about 24 | 4 mpg on hwy | 
 "words": Quality interior creature comforts sold me on this as well as a solid ride not jittery like the Honda | Very well thought out | Front seat folds flat several plugs for accessories such as dvd player plenty of cubby holes 6 cup holders storage nets on back of both front seats | 4 adjustments for driver seat-very comfortable for a bad back | Great ride handles nicely with tight turning radius | High quality materials | Very quiet little windnoise | Very deceiving on power feels like it is slower than it really is power is adequate about the same as a Ford Ranger does great on the hills with it smooth shifting tranny | Can manual shift | Excellent mileage 27 mpg in town | 
 "words": I just got my Tuscon and love it so far | I have heard complaints about the mileage but my only problem I have with that is I want to drive mine everywhere even if I have no where to go because it is very nice to drive so if i am using more gas it is because I am driving more | 
 "words": I absolutely love the way my new SUV handles | The gas is pretty good on highway 28 and 22 around town | Not too shabby | It's extremely comfortable and very roomy | It offers a lot for the price | Tinted windows in the back the seats fold down and the window in the way back can open with out opening the hatch back | I don't really have any dislikes | The only thing that I wish I could have gotten is four wheel drive | The warranty is Fantastic | 
 "words": 1 | During the week of April 1 I discovered the car was producing a bumpy ruff roller coaster ride | tossing me up and down back and forth and side to side | The seat was not absorbing the shock nor was it adjusting for my comfort | Then came the shocker the car's right back wheel seemed to slide to the right bumped then righted itself | I was instantly knocked to the right and then back to center | This action takes less than a second and seems to happen on an uneven indentation ridge or something in the road | This happens out of the blue and I do not feel safe | I notified Robert Lawson of my unhappiness with the seat and the ruff ride | 
 "words": I just got my Tucson a few days ago but I love it | It is affordable has a smooth ride and is very very spacious on the inside | I would recommend it to anyone who wants a SUV but cannot afford to get a Benz BMW or Cadillac | So get one and enjoy it | 
 "words": This car is awesome | I never thought I would own a Hyundai and was persuaded to test drive this by my girlfriend and am soooo glad I did | I love the styling comfort value and incredibly smooth ride | I test drove just about every small SUV and this was the clear winner | 
 "words": I've been wanting an SUV for 5 years and been planning on buying one for the past year | I did a LOT of research | The Tucson Limited has not disappointed me | I've almost hit 3000 miles on it after owning it less than 2 months | It's been on several day long road trips and did wonderful | My only real complaint is one I already knew about and applies to any SUV and that is the mileage | I'm averaging about 20mpg which is a combo of hwy city driving | On the interstate it averages about 23mpg | I actually expected it to do less so I'm pleased | I am really enjoying driving this car | It rides smooth | Has good acceleration | Mine is fully loaded | 
 "words": I never thought in a million years that I would buy an SUV | I was considering a small car like a Yaris for fuel economy but when I actually took these little cars for a test drive the novelty soon wore off | They just didn't seem safe to me | Sitting in the driver's seat of the Hyundai was a wonderful experience | I came for the value and stayed for the seat warmer | The gas mileage listed is the same as my old Impala in the city so I didn't lose there |
