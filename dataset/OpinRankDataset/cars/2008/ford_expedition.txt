REVIEWS
 "words": I've owned my 2008 Ford Expedition Limited for just about a year now and have 8k miles on it | For a fully loaded truck with all the toys got a great deal that was significantly cheaper than most competing models | Fuel-economy could be slightly better but for a large SUV it's sufficient | Don't drive it daily it's just the family shuttle bus | Extremely comfortable and handles well on highway | 6-speed transmission runs smooth but takes a second to kick in when you really need to accelerate to pass other vehicles | Needs a little more instant HP KICK | Cabin reasonably quiet | Kids love wireless headsets | Why pay 10-15K more for the same basic features in GM Toyota or Nissan models | 
 "words": I bought my 08 Eddie Bauer after my 02 Explorer bit the dust | Initially I wanted the Limited but chose the Eddie because it had the chrome grille and the Limited did not | I LOVE my new truck | Every time I get into it I remark about the comfort | My husband loves it also | The third row folding seats are a godsend | I will continually buy a Ford | I love this truck | I hope they never stop making it | 
 "words": After reading reviews here I decided to purchase a 2008 Eddie Bauer Expedition | I consider other SUVs including Toyota Sequoia and Chevy Tahoe but now I glad I selected the Ford | 
 "words": I love the way my new Limited Expedition rides however I am having problems with the windows | When the driver side is rolled down half way it makes a loud rattling noise | I took it to the dealer to get looked at several times and they said there is nothing they can do and that it is a normal occurance | It seems strange that a SUV of this caliber is suppose to have rattling windows | The Texas Customer Rep | is not trying to help my situation either | I feel like they are trying to sweep this problem under the rug | Is anyone else having this problem | 
 "words": All I have to say is I'm so glad I got over fear of big SUV's because this one is amazing | I'm 4'10 and I have never had an easier time driving a vehicle all the ways to adjust make it so easy and comfy to drive | I love how it fits 3 car seats side by side just in the second row alone | I love this car and I am never giving it up | 
 "words": Just puchased an 08 Exp Eddie Bauer 2wd | Looks great drives great and good fuel mileage for the size | Only issue is the DRL there is no option to turn them off | Other than that no complaints | 
 "words": On my third Expedition | This one is a 2WD EL Limited and I must admit I like it better thatn my others it has a softer ride feels heavier and is a little better on gas maybe the 6 speed | Only issues are soft shifts but for 18 mpg hwy I'll deal with it | Hope I can afford to buy it after lease and get the Supercharger and chip
 "words": Got rid of my 1999 Expedition and looking to upgrade to a new SUV | My new Expedition is so much better than my 1999 | The indepenent suspension is like night and day | The wood dash and leather seats tie together like a high end luxury car | This vehicle is my best by far | Price was 10 grand less then the Acadia and vehicle 10 times nicer | 
 "words": I was looking at getting an SUV | I went and test drove a new 2008 Expedition XLT model and fell in love with it | It rides great and handles like a car | I bought it the same day | I have been getting 12 MPG around town and 22 when I drive only freeway miles It comes with many great standard features for a base model and has the same engine and transmission as the Eddie Bauer or Limited versions | I also like the looks of this vehicle a lot | 
 "words": We just puchased used 08 Expedtion limited 4x4 | We love this thing | Drove it 600 miles at 78 mph and got 18 | 3 mpg | Ride is great for a 6'6 person and the room inside is perfect | We had reservations about buying one but not now | 
 "words": 10 months and 2700 miles later I'm impressed with the rock solid quiet interior great road manners surprisingly stable short braking and 14 20 MPG | I've owned 3 different Japanese vehicles in the past but given this massive Ford's decent-for- class mileage and quality I sure am glad I resisted the inclination to get a Sequoia and pocketed the extra 9000 | This SUV is the hidden gem in the field | Just compare its third row to the equivalent regular wheelbase GM Rover Infiniti and Toyota and you'll know that Ford's engineers have slaved as hard as their accountants to produce untouchable SUV value | Finally I find it exudes a strikingly handsome blend of toughness and aristocracy | 
 "words": I enjoy everything about this car | It has so many great features | My kids enjoy the capain chairs and watching DVD's | We recently had a power outage and we all watched a movie in the car | I have had cars with heated seats but this is my first with cooled seats | I feel very safe in this car | I looked a long time to find a car with all the features I wanted and I found it | 
 "words": This is my third Expedition and I still love the vehicle | Every time we compare to other SUV's and minivans | For the price and size you can't beat it | Our last was the 4 | 6L 2002 model so this was a change for us | While I miss the better gas mileage we are still getting 17 mpg | With kids we pack heavy | There's always plenty of room | The new design is boxier than the older style | I liked the older style's exterior better | However the new interior is much better | The stow-away 3rd seat and the middle bench that folds in three places is a big improvement | And as much as I miss that better MPG of the 4 | 6L I love the power when I hit the gas now | Third Expedition no complaints | 
 "words": I love this truck | After six months only one small problemheated and A C seat module needed replacement | Extremely comfortable ride better than any car I've owned | Seats are great on a long trip | Tows my 6000 lb | boat with ease | I'm now getting 18 mpg in mostly fast highway driving which is 2 miles better than my '03 V8 AWD Explorer | 10 mpg towing the boat The turning circle is reasonable given it's size | Acceleration is adaquate | Better ride quality and much better value than Toyota | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 Expedition and I was very happy with it | I rarely drive though due to high gas prices but when I do it is probably the best in my driveway | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Expy and and what an improvement over our 2004 | We liked our previous model but this one is so much better | Quiet smooth ride better control placement heavy duty brakes are a huge improvement back up sensors and more standard features included | Love the Sirius radio power fold flat seats are so much easier to manage and DVD entertainment system with the 8 screen | The 18 chrome clad wheels look great | Gas mileage isn't great with a vehicle this big but it is improved from our 2004 | About 14mpg in city driving so far | 
 "words": This is the first Ford I have ever owned and in fact the first domestic car since I was a kid | We tested every large SUV from the QX 56 to the Denali and Sequoia | The Expedition was the best priced and best balanced of the entire bunch | The independent rear suspension does make a difference in handling in comparison to the GM Yukon Tahoe variants | The interior is well thought out and while there are some rough edges no where near the interior disaster of the new Toyota Sequoia | If you have a large family and need to tow this vehicle serves its mission well | 
 "words": We needed a replacement for our 125000 mile Honda Pilot | Naturally the new 09 Pilot was our first stop | It wasn't an improvement over our current one | Looking and researching over two months brought us the Expedition | Wow what a serious step up | We got a true 8 passenger SUV for the price of a pretender | We love it | 
 "words": Most versatile vehicle we've ever owned | Grand kids get into out of child seats 3rd seat thanks to 2nd row buckets | Lots of safety features and great sound dvd nav system | Haven't taken a long trip yet but look forward to doing so | White Tri-Coat paint and Sand leather interior is great for hot Texas summers | 20 chrome wheels make it the best looking SUV out there Local driving so far has been very comfortable | Commanding seat position and good visibility all around | This is a vehicle we plan to keep for a long time | 
 "words": After 3 Explorers decided to move up altho I didn't need the size | Probably would have stayed with Explorer if there was power lift gate available | It is very comfortable but given its size it lacks any nimbleness | Pickup is only fair and stopping distance seems excessive | Just took our first long distance drive 800 miles r t and got 19 | 1 on highway which is better than any of the Explorers got | Don't use it for local drives so don't know about mileage | Like the fact that you can buy certain options as stand-alone like rear camera | 
 "words": As a life long Toyota buyer | I evaluated all the large SUV's and the Lambda platform and chose the Ford Expedition | Here's why More leg room and thigh support for driver passenger | Fold flat 2nd third row seats | Rear ratio of 3 | 37 gets equal gas milage with the Lambda AWD | I get 15 city 22 Highway driving the speed limit | It's a quieter ride | Dual weather stripping 6 Sp trans that doesn't hunt for gears | 6000 lb tow is 1500 more lbs than the tow package Lamabda | Adjustable pedals | Interior fit and finish is top notch and better equip for less money | Insurance is less | The Expedition is more capable and a better overall value | 
 "words": Narrowed my search down to new Sequoia and the Expedition based on the fold flat 3rd row seats and need for V8 for towing purposes | After comparing the 2 vehicles I was able to get a comparibly equipped Expy for 12K less than a Sequoia | And the Expy has a smooth 6 speed transmission and surprisingly I have 2K miles on it and trip computer is saying 16 | 4 mpg | Hands down the best bang for the buck in the large SUV segment | Buy it and use the extra 12k savings vs the Sequoia to pay for gas for the next 5 years | Also settle for the smaller standard tires and you will get better gas mileage | 
 "words": Ordered 4x4 Expo on 1 21 08 and took delivery on 3 11 08 Drove to Lubbock 325 miles and on 3 21 08 replaced torque converter | On 3 26 08 at 421 miles replaced torque converter and transmission | So far have not left city limits because of apprehension that it will leave me stranded at the ranch | Selling dealer and repairing dealer have been great | Gave me 2008 pickup to drive while repairs were made | It had only 220 miles on it and I was sure not to exceed 400 miles | 
 "words": With my height of seven foot tall obviously I can't drive just any vehicle | Thank goodeness for Ford and the Expedition it's the only vehicle I can comfortably drive my 1000 miles a week as a salesman | 
 "words": I love everything about my Limited | It's the perfect vacation-mobile | The sound system the ride comfort utility etc | are all excellent | I even put a bike carrier in the hitch receiver and take my sport bike to the track | I really like the copper metallic color too | This is the first vehicle I've ever owned that I can't think of anything I would change | I haven't had even one problem with it knock on wood | This review almost makes it sound like I work for Ford | I don't | 
 "words": In the first month of ownership I have no regrets about my choice | I traded a 2003 Explorer with many problems at 55k miles so I am leasing this one | I enjoy the room at 6 feet 2 I have lots of head room and extra seat travel both of which the Explorer lacked | The ride quality is excellent much better than the 2008 Toyota Sequoia I tested particulary over less than perfect pavement | Power is adaquate although I haven't towed my boat yet | Turning circle is fine for such a large truck | Gas usage is not terrible given it's 5625 lb | As per the trip computer I an averaging 15 | 2 on mostly highway compared to 16 on the Explorer | 6 speed transmission very smooth and low revving | 
 "words": I gave my Expedition 10 scores throughout for a reason | For a large SUV one cannot expect to get 25 MPG | I drive the posted speed limit at all times and my average up till now only 2100 miles is 15 | 6 | Considering that I came back to an Expedition from a Honda Pilot I am thrilled with the gas mileage | Comparing my Pilot which averaged around 19 MPG I didn't give up that much gas mileage given the much larger vehicle that the Expedition is | The comfort and ride spells luxury in my book | So far no problems and the dealer is the best I've ever dealt with | 
 "words": This is my first Ford and so far I like it | Out of all other large SUV's this one is best bang for the buck in my opionion | Nice design both inside and out | Lost of room | 
 "words": Our Limited looks great gets a lot of compliments and is a very nice vehicle to drive | Big vehicle and you feel very safe but pay in gas mileage but nothing unexpected avg for us is about 14 | 7 | Major disappointment has been useable storage space | The front of the vehicle is largely taken up by the center console | There is just one big hole in the armrest and little else | If two people up front you will have stuff tucked under your legs on your lap etc | especially if you have kids | Back seats not much better seem like always stuff all over the floor boards | Coming from a TC minivan the space has been a real issue | Power could be slightly better but did not expect to drag race | 
 "words": Amazing handling and comfort for a large SUV | The design is very sharp with the 20 wheels | Get comments on it regularly | The navigation system stereo etc are top of the line | Nice twist on the back up camera | All that while hauling three kids in car seats 2 dogs and a 5000lb boat | Very nice looking functional and solid vehicle | 
 "words": Have liked this new design since it came out for 07 | Finally got one early this month | Wish I had done it sooner | 20 wheels really set it off- perfect size in proportion to the size of the vehicle | Truck feels very solid tight | Very quiet inside | Very comfortable | Heated seats warm lower back in addition to seat bottom | that was a pleasant surprise | Brakes feel very strong | Engine feels strong as well | My wife drives it more than me | She absolutely loves it | I'm looking forward to trying out the air conditioned seats next summer as well as the 9200lb towing capacity | -Have a 5200lb boat 8000lbs with trailer fuel and gear My old Tahoe was only rated to pull 7000lbs | 
 "words": This Expy makes our 3rd | A gold XLT witht he 4 | 6 V-8 an black XLT with the bigger V and this white 08 XLT | The progression and evolution of these vehicles is remarkable | The 08 is a s good as anything from any other manufacturer including GMC Chevy Toyota Nissan and Honda | and in fact better than them in many ways | The quality is great features for the price remarkable ride and handling not at all what we expected very smooth quiet and controlled | The V8 as typical for the Expedition does not feel as peppy as the sound and horsepower would indicate but it's a trailer pulling mule | Big and barn like inside comfortable seats leg room and head room great | Love it | 
 "words": Everything you'd expect in an American full sized SUV | Solidly built exceptional comfort surprisingly nimble especially in parking lotsall at a decent price | Our first choice would have been a Mercedes GL 450 at 64000 | Almost 30000 more than the XLT and the XLT was far more comfortable | The only problem with the XLT is the poor MPG | 13 | 5 MPG for an average is not unexpected just getting to be expensive | 19 MPG on the highway is OK but not good enough | With that said overall our family loves this truck | Comfort safety and quality sums it up | 
 "words": Seriously how do you rate this as fun to drive | It's as big as a boat | That's why I bought it though | It gets lously mileage | I knew that up front | You'll not get more than 14 with the 4wd | But no other SUV other than the new Sequoia will have as much leg room and be as comfortable | The specs on the Tahoe look comparable but if you actually sit in one you'll wonder what kind of ruler they were using | The 3rd row is useless and the 2nd row is still tight | I wanted room | Besides the Expo has absolutely the most non-truck looking interior of them all at least in the under 50K line I tried not to go back but saw no compariable options out there for ride comfort and usability | 
 "words": This is by far the best vehicle I have owned to date | While it is a large SUV it handles and rides more like a car and the interior is as luxurious as my wife's Lexus | I've had so many comments already on the styling and the interior | 
 "words": This is a hot truck | It is really quiet inside compare to the last Expedition I traded in | Handles really well great stereo good power | I have received a lot of compliments already on the interior | 
 "words": I just recently bought a brand new '08 Expedition Eddie Bauer | It is my best SUV so far | The back-up camera and GPS systems are excellent | The new 6-speed tranny is also smooth and powerful | I used to own a '05 Expedition and was about to buy a Tahoe until I noticed that the Tahoe had absolutely no legroom and used a '90s 4-speed tranny | Then I saw the new Expedition and fell in love with it | Not only does the new Expedition feel good but it's fun to drive | The fuel economy has also improved from the previous generation | It is my new favorite in my driveway | 
 "words": We switched after two Tahoe's and 2 Pathfinders | The final decision after reviewing MB GL Chevy Tahoe GMC Range Rover Sport Nissan and Infiniti and Toyota was this loaded Expedition Limited | The big factors Design navigation nystem folding 3rd row interior finish tow package | At a lower price than anything the competition could offer | My wife is the primary driver and loves it already | 
 "words": Over the last couple of months I've had so much fun offroading the Expedition taking it to long distance trips it cannot get any more comfortable it already is it feels as if they used Nasa cushion in the chairs any ways i'm happy with my Expedition and I'm planning to keep it for a long time | I'm also going to keep the cheap black plastic
