REVIEWS
 "words": The best car I've owned in my 63 years of living | I'am 6'3 tall and have all the room I need | My 100lb German Shepard comes with me on errands and seats clean up easily | Again great car | 
 "words": The gas mileage sticker claimed 15 25 | Well I get about that city but highway I get usually 33mpg going 55mgh gets 27 mpg going 65 mph as long as I stay out of it | Brakes are amazing handling is also amazing for a 4 door family car that weights 4600lbs | My main complaint is the quality of the materials | I take very good care of my car and baby it | The leather on the seats is starting to wear more then my 5 year old Cadillac I had prior the paint job stinks it's starting to chip and wear in places it shouldn't for a 2 year old car and the interior is all plastic | Shouldn't this problem with a 30000 car | 
 "words": These GP GXP's are a terrific value right now | Very stylish inside and out | It is a blast to drive the V8 is strong and produces a great exhaust tone on the road it handles the road with ease all instrumentation is easy to read and driver friendly | Everyone loves te suede leather bucket seats they are really comfortable | I have plenty of head leg room | The 18 inch rims really make the car stand out in the parking lot | The GXP makes driving fun again sporty with V8 power to match and all the extra options you'd expect from a luxury car | The 05-08 GXP's14800 are one of the automotive industry's best kept secrets | I'm very very happy with mine | 
 "words": My Pontiac is a standard coupe with options | It has remote start great for winter for heat or summer for A C built-in antenna painted alloy wheels full power seats windows doors etc | Body on outside is great | The interior is overall good besides a little rattle of the smallest imobile vent in the dash that is intermittent | Everyone loves my car but I've seen the same frame on the reliable world famous 2002 Impala | That is not a bad thing at all the interior is way different | I can't be more annoyed by prissy-foot drivers saying too much torque | IT IS A PONTIAC | THEY MAKE ALL CARS FASTER | My Pontiac NEVER got stuck in the 2009 winter storm of Seattle | 8 anywhere | 
 "words": Was fun to drive in the summer but living in Michigan it is single- handedly the worst vehicle I have ever driven on snow and ice | It was so bad that it could no longer be used on the freeway during the winter | Also for over a year now there is a constant squeaking noise coming from the front tire | Three times to the dealership new brakes and they still can't find out what's wrong | Have also had a electronic system failure warning pop up on the dash display twice | Not very comforting when you drive on the freeway everyday | Overall too many problem for a new car | 
 "words": I purchased this car with about 12000 on it as a former program car | The car right of the bat sold itself as far as performance and comfort went | I fell in love with the rumble of the exhaust | And punch the pedal and you can feel the pull | As for torque steer we are talking about an big torgue high hp V-8 in a car | Not some little handa with 200 hp and no real torque so of course you will have this at times | Just hold on and make sure you are aimed in a direction other than whats desired | Torque steer can also be found in any Cadillac fwd with the northstar | 
 "words": I've only had this car for 6 days highway was nice with little background noise with auto radio | I get excited every time I drive and love the car it's the newest car I | ve ever owned and more power then I | m used to but I | m trying to conserve | it's roomy for everyone | The car does have get up and go haven | t gone on highway for long distance | I too like cockpit feel and how everything centers around me driving and easy access to info | I would like less plastic and stronger feel buttons I want this car to last and look good the whole time | I also hope they might bring back and improve gas or turn to cng car or hydrogen car for zero emission | and I'd get that I got this cause owned two pontia
 "words": I think it was a big mistake for GM to do away with the Grand Prix | I love mine | I test drove a new G8 and was not impressed at all | The 2008 Grand Prix got a bad rap when they underrated it as just another carry over car that was ready to be put out to pastureso to speak | I will drive this one with pride and hope GM brings it back in a few years like the Camaro | 
 "words": I bought my Grand Prix 08 last year | My husband took me to a place right off base | And i saw a beautiful white pearl car staring at me | we have a daughter who is turning 3 | and let me tell you | the car is sooo smooth | everyone who gets in | their first word is WoW this is a smooth car | plus it's big enough for a family | yet compact enough to be sporty | my husband loves my car | and my favorite feature is when you first get in every single detail curves around the driver | I would say its made to fit you | Not to mention in these economic times we get about 19 24mpg yet it's cheaper then the camry and the malibu | 
 "words": I had a 2006 Grand Prix GT V6 Supercharged and fell in love with it | I have always been a big Mazda fan growing up but had to switch to Pontiac after trading in my Mazda 6S for the 06 Grand Prix GT | I had it for 8 months and then sadly wrecked it | So i turned around and jumped right back into a 2008 Grand Prix but the GXP this time | I love it | There is room for improvement which i believe they have accomplished it in the new G8 But people this is an awsome car | Especially for the price | I got mine slightly used with 9k miles on it it MSRP for 29800 but being that its the last year for the Grand Prix and with the G8 now available I got my GP GXP for 19000 and you can't beat that | 
 "words": I just purchased my 2008 Grand Prix Sedan I am just loving it | I had a Chrysler Sebring then a Chevrolet HHR my favorite is the Grand Prix | Just wish it was summer so I could ride the highway | But I just enjoy driving it back forth to work | It's comfortable classy and has get up go when you want it to | Plenty of space too | Love the display that lets me know if the tire pressure is low and also the option to have OnStar makes me feel a little better driving in the snow in Michigan | I feel secure | A must drive must buy and enjoy | 
 "words": The Grand Prix has always been one of the cars that I've liked so i decided to give it a look wheni was in the market even though this was its last year | The drive is assurred and fun with ample power | i like the aggressive styling and the quiet cabin | the interior is a tad bland but everything else makes up for it | the drivers seat is nice and comfortable and envelopes you in the seat | it feels like it has more than the 200 HP that it's rated at as its quick out the gate and its mice to have the power when needed | Good MPG in my first 1K I avg 23MPG in the city which is excellent for a V6 | bottom line is that I think that I've made the best decision as this was a great value | 
 "words": My purchase was a rental fleet vehicle with sunroof and leather heated seats XM Radio | Well below MSRP great value | After driving my impressions have only improved | Vehicle was impressive for the price | Ergonomics for driver and front seat passenger are great | Headroom with sunroof for passenger is only issue for tall passengers | Fold flat front seat and rear seats give almost incredible transport capacity | its almost like a small SUV for cargo | Driver info display radio and climate controls as well as steering wheel controls are well thought out | Lumbar support seat adjustments and heated seats make vehicle comfortable for long distance driving | Buy used for real value | 
 "words": My husband and i are military so we have a lot of traveling | we needed something big enough for a growing family | my dad has a 06' and he LOVES it so we bought one and this car is the ANSWER | I get about 22 31 which is great for this size of car | we love it
 "words": Affordable sedan that looks great front wheel drive for Colorado snow and sporty feel and drive | Reliable and refined W platform means nice ride and long life power train 3800 Gen III V6 engine | Power is adequate | 
 "words": I am a long time Pontiac fan | While considering the new G8 I also researched other cars that Pontiac had to offer | Once I found out about all the standard equipment that the 2008 Grand Prix I never looked back | It has everything you need at a MSRP of 22210 | Right now is a great time to consider this automobile | When I purchased my new Grand Prix on 8-8- 2008 Pontiac offered a great cash rebate or fair financing | Also this is the last year of the Grand Prix | Dealerships will definitely work with you on your final purchase price | Thank you
 "words": I rented this car for a week on Maui and was pleasantly surprised | I've always liked the looks of the Grand Prix and after sitting behind the wheel I really began to dig it | It took a little getting used to the layout of the cabin but once I did I found myself loving the feel of the car | Smooth power great in the twisties driving up down the switchbacks to the Haleakala crater at 10000 ft | The interior feels a little cheap but I'd only place it a little below the '08 Camry | Overall I'd say this is a fun car for a good price and definitely worth a look if you're in the market for a sedan | 
 "words": 3 weeks 1500 miles of ownership so far totally satisfied | Looks great on the outside inside ivory White camel interior | Nice stock sound system very nice ergonomic comfort features makes this car fun to drive pleasure to own can't wait to drive it every day | Refined powertrain is peppy too | Handling other features are better than consumer reports says they are | By the way | One has to drive this automobile to appreciate it thank you gm | 
 "words": After reading the Edmunds Editor review I have to conclude that he or she did not even drive the car | First of all the GXP V8 weighs less than the old 3 | 8 supercharged GTP and I have seen 0 60 in less than 6 seconds | This car is a great blend of performance fun comfort and if driven correctly on the highway can get super mileage | I have been averaging 29 mpg on the highway and can still punch it out from a red light and leave a nice cloud of smoke in the rear view mirror | True to the G8 is a great performance car but try driving it in the snow | At least the GXP gives you the V8 push and still offers descent year round driving capabilities | Next time have your editor drive one | 
 "words": This car is very fun I think people driving next to you don't expect this car to perform as it does it is a sedan | I've owned many nice cars and todays economy has forced me to buy under 20000 | For the money this car is perfect for average sized people small families can benefit greatly | I can't believe the gas mileage | It rides like a silent hotrod if you will but cost very minimal to operate | Say what you want about the fancy technology inside get extended warranty | The power train warranty is piece of mind enough | Would recommend this car to anybody | 
 "words": I bought this car and drove from New Jersey to Florida and back very nice ride for long distance the front seats felt kinda hard and uncomfortable but the handling and the speed makes up for it a lot of power for a 6 cyl | For the size of the car spins tires with ease great high speed handling would recommend to anybody
 "words": This car is very nice the day after I bought the car I drove it from New Jersey to Florida and it drove great the whole way good power also not a whole lot but its got a lot of pep and will spin tires extremely easy had some problems with the molding under the windshield wipers but the dealer is taking care of that its got a semi sporty interior but a lot of plastic 
 "words": What an awesome car | I am a little sad that this will be the last Grand Prix model year and that 2 doors are not an option anymore | But otherwise I have owned 4 Pontiacs 2nd Grand Prix other was a 01 GT and I expect the same level of satisfaction as with all the others | Gas mileage is NOT BAD for a V8 especially with the active fuel management system | When you spend as much time in a car as I do commuting you must LOVE your car | Traded a Mazda CX7 | The CX7 was awful on gas with a 4 cyl very hard to see out of and felt cheap | I did not feel the joy of zoom zoom | I definitely like the VROOM VROOM more | 
 "words": This car is the car of my dreams | It rides smoothly which makes me feel like I'm floating | I love the space and all the things that come along with it | 
 "words": Love this car | Fun Fun and more fun | But I like to just cruise and take in easy in the most wonderful and great looking sport seats | Great sound system | Reviewers bad rap this auto how it looks body | Trust me people still look at it all the time | Still loved by the common folk | 
 "words": As far as this thing compared to a European sedan that's like comparing a Jackhammer to a golf club | It does go but pretty much where ever the surplus of traction happens to be hang on tight | or you might kiss the guard rail | Amenities are good but overkill Stealth Mode is a bit sophomoric as are the useless fixed tap shifters in a dated 4 speed slush box | they work fine as a two speed stoplight racer | Brakes are more aesthetic than athletic and where is the Spare tire | a can of goo | Interior quality typical GM with loose door panelsone fell off in parking lot after opening drivers door | cheap plastic buttons and drooping headliner | Not too reassuring in a new car
 "words": I have had my GXP for few months now | I had an 04 GTP and I must say that having the GXP is a big difference | The rumble from the exhaust is much greater and once you step on the gas you go | The tires are summer tires though which is a concern living in Chicago | Overall it's a blast to drive | 
 "words": We just drove this car for a week and drove 3000 miles in it with our dog | It was a very comfortable great car with a lot of room | We drove it from Nevada to Nebraska in rain blowing snow gusting winds and some black ice | 
 "words": I just got my GXP | WOW | My son has a BMW 325ci and now all he wants to drive is my American muscle V8 | Front Wheel drive is cool in a V8 | The torque steer is kinda weird but it is great is the rain and snow | I have been looking for a new car for several years but the GTO was not up to par the Charger is no fun to drive the 3 series BMW is too small and the 5 series and Lexus are too expensive and this car competes with them rather handsomely | 
 "words": I traded in my 04 Grand Prix GTP to upgrade to a 08 GXP and I must say that what a difference it makes having a V8 engine | It rumbles and has much more power than the GTP | It handles better with the front tires being wider than the rear | I'm a Grand Prix fan and always will be | 
 "words": While the exhaust notes are a delightful symphony the suspension and torque steer remove any fantasies of carving a canyon and putting the whup on any German engineered product | First impression throaty growl stimulates adrenal gland | then ride on the street is like drinking sour milk | Suspension is so soft that the front emd bottoms out at speed over moderate undulations in the road | Feels like floating in a raft in the pool | Torque steer nearly planted me in the car in the next lane on the freeway | Under hard acceleration it is not unlike flying a helicopter don't even think of releasing the controls | Constant input requirement drowns the fun of the acceleration | 
 "words":  A dream and a hoot to drive | Beautiful erogonomic interior | all dials and switches easy to use and read | fabulous acceleration and gas mileage | zippo maintenance | and I don't have to carry a mechanic with me or pay for his trips to Germany or Japan every few months | the GM sleeping giant has awakened | big time | Here is a fairly priced car that does it all | And yeah it's American | 
 "words": Great car | Gas mileage is good but could be better | Very fun to drive yet very comfortable | 
 "words": Our fourth Grand Prix | Comfortable ride with decent acceleration | Very stylish | Reliable transportation | stable with ABS and traction control | 
 "words": Let me start by saying I've only had this car a few days but wow | It is awful | No light in the trunk | Front doors don't unlock when you open the door twice | The odomoter is in a stupid place | The radio has FM text good luck reading it | The A pillars are in AWFUL locations visibility out of the car is dangerously deminished | I think Pontiac hired Pablo Picasso to do the interior ergonomics | I'm sure someone calls it beautiful but it doesn't fit any human | The steering wheel is just awkward has too much slop play and feels cheap | The seats are also rather bad | As for how the car drives | Awful | The car I have doesn't have anti-locks | 
 "words": Excellent car | Very reliable and fun to drive | 3800 V6 sounds sweet with dual exhaust | I have always had GM vehicles and have been impressed with all but especially Pontiac | Sporty yet comfortable | 
 "words": After driving 2 GTP's and a Comp G my experience with the GXP is simply amazing | The GXP is truely a culmination | The Grand Prix is truly expressed through the performance and styling of this car the 08 GXP | If it had anymore technology or performance improvements it would exceed the already excessively designed and engineered German products | The car is precise and smartly cued with technology comforts and prestige without the lavish and 'non-sensical' over statements and cost common to many up level Euro-imps | I want to ride American and feel good about it | GXP is a very good feeling | especially when I remind myself of its price operating and maintenance cost | 
 "words": The GXP is a serious American sports sedan that is a true competitor with the high priced over designed and excessively engineered German products particularly BMW 5 series | The 08 GXP performance handling acceleration and braking is sweet and enjoyable without being too riggid or over the top | On road bumps the 08 GXP is a little untamed | instead of a smart crisp dip the 08 GXP sort of rolls over 'certain' road bumps | This is not a problem persay | The tires are my only concern | 2 different sizes and no tire rotation and no spare is a real challenge | 08 GXP Smart sweet gorgious |
