REVIEWS
 "words": I bought this vehicle and from day one have had problems | I have the LTZ and first the sunroof and entertainment system broke on day one they replaced it | Then the check engine light came on twice and fixed it something with the omission system covered by warranty | Then the door handle came off for no reason in my hand not covered by warranty dealer said this happens to Tahoe's | Then intermediate steering column makes clunk noise not covered by warranty GM is aware of problem but won't recall it because not a safety issue | costs 300 | I don't know about you but steering is a safety issue | No trunk space with 3rd row up | Not happy can't wait to trade it | 
 "words": Definitely love this Tahoe | This is my second SUV | Came from a 2006 Hummer H3 which I realized was a mistake shortly after the purchase | Even thought both vehicles are GM products the Tahoe by far is definitely a better vehicle in every category i | e | comfort build quality interior exterior gas mileage and ride | My girlfriend and I absolutely love to drive the HOE | Avg | city mpg is around 15 | 5 and hwy when cruising around 70 mph is 21 | Not bad for a 5600 lb | vehicle with a V8 | Plan on keeping the Tahoe for many years | 
 "words": Bought my Tahoe new last October on the 0 interest deal | Truck drives as smooth as can be on the highway | No squeeks rattles or loose parts in the interior and I am now at 12000 miles | It is a bit sluggish for me but power is good for the vehicle size nothing a custom tune can't fix | I tend to have a heavy foot and I am comparing it to the Trailblazer SS I had right before it | This is my first Full Size SUV and I am pleased so far | Feels like I am driving a house on wheels because it is so comfortable to drive | I feel very safe with my wife and baby boy in the car | I can get about 450 miles mixed driving to a tank of gas which is excellent in my opinion for a vehicle this size | 
 "words": First Chevy I've owned | It's very roomy and comfortable | Love sitting high up on the road | 
 "words": First GM in years | Came from a 08 Chevy classic truck | Bought this one sight unseen due to color prefrence | Tahoe was built in Arlington assembally plant | Very poor build job had to adjust tailgate latch to get it to close adjusted all doors and folding seats for smoother operation | Very poor rear seating quality jamming is a problem when folding | Been in shop 4 times for electronic problems intermittent failures of 4 wheel drive Stabilitrac Trac control | Looks like side molding tape will pull loose soon | Dealer claims wiring harness was routed wrong and was the cause of electronic faults | Again poor build quality | My suggestion would be to get your Tahoe from another assembally plant | 
 "words": I love my Tahoe | It is my third Tahoe and I can't say enough good things about it | Drives wonderful smooth and quiet | Radio is awesome | Gas mileage is not much different from a mini van | Gives me a safe feeling when driving it | Handles and turning ratio is great | 
 "words": My wife and I have been wanting a new Tahoe for over a year | With the 0 and all we still couldn't afford much more than a base model LS | But we found a leftover 2008 LT with the LT2 package plus second row bucket seats third row vinyl seats | MSRP was over 42K after Red tag and additional rebates we paid 31K | Even with paying 5 interest we were able to afford way more car than with the 0 sales | Go find a 2008 Tahoe now you have the power to buy it for next to nothing | 
 "words": Got out of a Toyota Tundra | Loved it looking for 5 seating | My new LTZ is all the truck I'll need | Stuck with a truck SUV because of the family boat | Cannot believe I paid 17000 less than MSRP could not find a better deal for same amount of truck anywhere | If you are in the market you have 100 leverage and can buy a Tahoe for less than ever now | 
 "words": My neighbor and I bought vehicles at the same time | I bought the Tahoe and he bought the Expedition | We constantly rib each other about whose is better | Upon first drives they both were very good vehicles | The Tahoe softer and the Ford more nimble | Nearly a year later I rode with him last week | His is still quiet | Mine squeaks rattles has highway wind noise | I never thought I'd say this but I did not want to get back in my Chevy after riding in his year old Ford | Sorry GM it's good on test drives and initial quality but just doesn't hold together as well as your competitor | 
 "words": Love this SUV | Can't say enough | So comfortable power is ok | The look is top notch | Great family car if you have less than 3 kids | I would recommend this over the Expedition or Durango any day | 
 "words": Love my new Tahoe | Just came from an Armada and do miss some of the extra storage but I'm loving the ride super comfort | Mileage is awesome | If you practice hypermiling you can get 17mph around town | It's amazing how far this will coast | I didn't realize that new vehicles are designed to disengage the tranny when you let your foot off the gas | Great way to improve economy | Just went to Maine and got 20 | 4 hwy at 75mph and 21 when I cut it back to 62- 65mph | 
 "words": We bought the new 2008 Tahoe 6 27 08 and already have a major concern | We have a growing family and and our new one w 3rd seat stinks | The seating design was obviously not thought out very well | We purchased the 2008 with two full benches second row has 40 60 split and the car seat latch anchors tetherssystem was not put in the correct spot | They are located on the 40 spilt and the middle seat of the 60 spilt of the second bench putting these directly behind the passenger seat and in the the middle making it impossible for anyone to accesess the 3rd bench without removing and re-installing a child car seat every time to access 3rd seat | have 2 c s's
 "words": The Chevy Tahoe is one of a kind | Chevy has stepped its game up | Coming to fuel economy it get sabout 14 CTY 19 HWY | That is saying a little bit | The cons of the vehicle are the third row of seating has about 2-4 inches of leg room the truck space is very limited | On some LT models the rims are not designed good | The pros are great towing ability 1st and 2nd row comfort | The design is very nice and interior is nice | 
 "words": Great Vehicle | MPG is around avg 15 city and 19 highway | I have been able to get 22-23 hwy on many long trips if your not heading into the wind | Even while towing it gets around 17-18 mpg and it's so quiet on the highway too | 
 "words": My husband just bought me this '08 LTZ in the white diamond appearance pkg | w 20 wheels | It's a definite head turner | After driving a Toyota for 10years with no real issues I was set on getting another Toyota | However you can't beat the Tahoe in price and all the options | With a family of 4 we can't ask for anything more | And gas mileage is pretty good for such a large SUV | It's pretty comparable to the minivans we looked at | I'm getting about 16mpg in the city and about 21mpg on interstate driving | The Tahoe is the way to go | 
 "words": I went from a 07 Rendevouz to a 08 Tahoe this past January | That was the best move ever | I now have room for 3 kids 5 more adults to sit comfortably | Chevy has outdone themselves with the nice exterior look and comfortable ride | 
 "words": Smooth SUV | Got the LT2 package with 20 wheels | The Granite blue paint turns heads on the road | Plenty of power and you can't beat the price | Gas mileage is on average 15-16mpg | Drove the Yukon and you can get the same package in a Chevy for a few thousand less | 
 "words": I love my new Tahoe | The ride and styling are awesome | Rides better than the car I traded | I have an LT3 with the Z71 package | I considered the LTZ but felt I was getting a lot of expensive features that don't add much resale value | Save yourself the 2K for 20 wheels on the LTZ and get the Z71's 18 inchers | The Z71 also has all the chrome accents of an LTZ | I agree with another post that the Active Fuel Mgmt is a gimmick but E85 is awesome | So what if mileage goes down the fuel is cheaper and Made in the USA | 
 "words": Bought the LTZ with Sun Fun and Entertainment package | I must say we love the car | This is my 3rd current generation Tahoe | had an '01 '04 and now the '08 | A few fit and finish issues with seat covering pulling away from cushion | but nothing too tragic | They did fix a service bulletin item on my first service visit | problem with spring over left rear tire being slightly eskew caused a weird klunk when you went over speed bumps | Fixed at no charge | about 1 2 hr work | We've been very happy with the car | Gas mileage is better than a Honda Odyssey with lots of room comfort and luxury | Recommend highly | but haggle cause everybody's dumping their SUV's these days | 
 "words": I've had my LTZ now for about 2 months and am pretty happy with it | Had an '03 Sequoia and was about to pull the trigger on an '08 but decided to test drive the Tahoe | thank God I did | Better looking more features and a better price than the Toyota | Only thing the Seqouia had which I wish the Tahoe has is fold flat 3rd row seating and a little more rear storage room | I've towed our boat and the automatic rear leveling suspension which I guess is only available on the LTZ works great | I wish I would have bought this a few months earlier to try the 4x4 out | By the way the guy who wrote that he's getting 18 | 3 mpg 70 city is a liar | I'm getting 14-15 mpg in 50 50 city hwy driving | 
 "words": After 1 | 5 years of SUV research and actually targeting the Denali we found the White Diamond LTZ and were totally impressed over the Denali | Purchased this beautiful SUV w White Diamond Pkg 20 Wheels Sun Dest Ent Pkg Titanium Interior 2 weeks ago for my wife and we both absolutely love it | I cannot say enough about being so impressed with how far GM has come in their interior design dead-silent cabin feature rich appointments and overall comfort | With 2 kids bags laptop cases a stroller and almost daily trips to the store this SUV is the most awesome and fitting vehicle we have owned to date | We intend to use the OnStar as it will incoporate family shared plans on Verizon | 
 "words": Bot this car since we commute 1x week 200 miles back and forth from home to work through the mountains of western Maryland | This truck is a dream to drive on the highway | We bought the car because of 0 finance and GM rebate | The 49000 sticker was really the same price as a 36K car so it was a good value | We are pleased except that the car is so big and heavy it is a little tough in the city | Gas mileage for us is 16 | 9 combined over the past 5000 miles | 
 "words": Compaired Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia bought the Tahoe | A lot more equiptment for the money nicer interior and better gas mileage | New 100K 5yr warranty also helped with decission | I have the LTZ with all the toys and they all work as advertised | Ride is very smooththe V8 to V4 modes are seamless | Biggest negative is rear seating especially the 3rd row and the lack of independant rear suspension | The Toyota is the winner in these areas | The 08 Tahoe appears larger than my 03 Tahoe Z71 but it has the same dimentions | The 08 is less truck like than the 03 with a lower dash | The 03 did have more storage areas than the 08 | 
 "words": Just got my wife into the 2LT with the Sun Entertainment package added in | It's basically an LTZ without the chrome and the heated rear seats | We got it black with cashmere tan interior | It's super sharp looking | The wife loves it | Our goal was to have our three kids fit across the 2nd row bench seat leaving plenty of cargo room or room for other kids | It's no problem | The kids love the DVD and the wife is loving the sweet Bose system with sat radio nav and the rear view cam | I can't wait to start trying the OnStar and try towing my boat with it | This makes our old loaded Pacifica look pretty lame | If you need the full size SUV for the family this ride is truly great | 
 "words": i just bought a black LTZ and sure it is a head turner with the chrome package being standard | It came with the 20 inch wheels and love the way they work with the shocks and suspention | All together they give a very comfortable ride | 
 "words": My family recentley bout a white diamond edition LTZ Tahoe 2wd | The vehicle is excellent its luxurious but we still can tow our boat with it | The navigation system and power tailgate make for easy loading and directions | The OnStar system is also handy | My mom already got locked out and they opened our doors right up | The car has some Escalade bling to it as well | The 20 rims accent the metallic white diamond paint well | The chrome grille makes the truck look more powerful | And it gets fairly good mpg for a full size truck as well | 
 "words": I downsized from my 2005 Suburban but haven't regretted the loss of cargo area | I purchased this vehicle with all available options including the Z71 off road protection | Have had it loaded with 3 hunters 25 geese decoys 3 duck blinds and all our gear and could've added more can't wait for turkey season | This vehicle handles exceptionally well and is an absolute pleasure to drive always comfortable ride and has felt safe to drive in all of our weather conditions- rain ice and snow | 
 "words": Growing up as the son of an executive in the auto industry I started at a young age having the opportunity to drive many different styles and types of vehicles | My first personal SUV purchase was a 1991 Chevy Trailblazer | From there I've owned leased or at least have driven every GM style SUV both full size and mid size | In December my company decided it was time for me to turn in my 2003 Chevy Tahoe as it had 167000 miles on it | Picking up the new Black 4wd LT was very exciting however I didn't realize just how exciting it truely was going to be | It rides better than most cars I've driven | Hands down it's the best SUV I've ever driven | 
 "words": I just got my Tahoe LTZ | I love it it drives great and it's very comfortable | I like how the LTZ comes standard with navigation i drive a lot and it is really helpful | I got it in black and with the 20 chrome rims and the chrome handles it definentley stands out | I also love the power deployed side steps |

 "words": I switched from a 02 Deviile to the Tahoe for more room due to an expanding family and didn't want a minivan | Never owned a SUV much less driven one | I'll never own a car again | 
 "words": 2008 Tahoe w 2LT | Compared to my 05 Yukon SLT the new Tahoe is a huge improvement | Interior specifically the dash is now luxurious as opposed to looking like a cheap truck | Leather is much better quality | 3rd row seats still don't fold flat have to manually remove | But now the 2nd row doesn't fold flat | They tumble forward to allow access to 3 row | Nice if you need it but I'd rather have the 2nd row fold flat like the older version that made the cargo area cavernous | Yukon was loud lots of wind noise | This Tahoe is quiet and has a very smooth ride | Expert reviews complain its too soft and unresponsive | I'll take soft any day | Not doing slaloms in a 5500 lb trk | avg 16 mpg
 "words": I got this Tahoe LTZ after trading in my '02 Tahoe | I thought that was a great SUV until I got my new Tahoe | It's absolutely beuatiful in white with the chrome wheels grille and in white | The insides white leather seats are the most comfortable seats I've ever sat in | Already at 2500 miles and I'm getting 18 | 3 MPG with about 70 city driving | I've owned a '02 Tahoe '98 Tahoe and this is the best Tahoe by far
 "words": After due research I decided against the BMW X5 and the Mercedes GL320 in favor of the Tahoe LTZ based on total satisfaction on my previous 2002 Tahoe | I am very satisfied with the choice and I saved 25000 over the others | The Tahoe so far exceeds anything I experienced in testing out the BMW or Mercedes | The fuel economy should improve as I break in the engine | Recommend this awesome car | Also recommend the sun and sound options with the LTZ that includes the rear camera DVD Navigation system and sunroof | 
 "words": As a previous Ford owner we are trying our first Chevy | So far it has been great | OnStar and navigation systems are a very nice asset | The comfort is comparable to the Ford Expedition possibly more room in the front seats than the Ford counterpart | Ride is what you would expect from the SUV vehicle market | Interior is roomy with rider's comfort in mind | Third row is tight and Chevy needs to take a lesson from Ford in this area | 
 "words": After going Japanese for the last 7 years I finally went back to the General and I was not disappointed | My Tahoe LTZ is very well built comofortable beautiful and drives every bit as well as any import | I recently bought my wife an Audi Q7 and with the exception of the Audi's Ipod interface I enjoy the Tahoe hands down over the Audi | I only wish that Chevy would finally put in fold flat seats in the vehicle | 
 "words": First GM product I have puchased in 30 years | I've driven a 97 Land Cruiser since it was new and it's still going strong with 160000 miles | I will say the Tahoe has a tough act to follow but so far so good |
