 "words": This is my 5th Suv | After having owned Nissans and Jeeps I purchased the FJ for my wife to haul around kids dogs and ski gear | It is a disaster of design | The interior is dark and visibility is terrible | I can get by these issues however It's the worst SUV I've ever driven when it comes to performance in snow | We hit the slopes whenever it snows and this vehicle is brutal | Regardless of tires it's not safe to drive | Coupled with it's nervous anti-lock brakes it's a dangerous vehicle to control in a blizzard | Our Xterra performed much better with the Jeep being the best | The stain proof seats get dog hair caught in the open fibres and I have to use duct tape to clean it |

 "words": I looked for 3 months at SUVs and I always came back to the fj | It was big purchase for me because I wanted a vehicle that was going to be truly reliable and not in the repair shop all the time and I have worked previous at 2 GM dealerships even all my mechanic friends give it 2 thumbs up | I've driven in some pretty crazy 4x4 zones with it and it's performed excellent and a truly fun truck to drive | I don't find the blind spot a big deal and everyone that has sat in the backseat has found it easy to enter and exit | I would suggest to all to take one for a test drive | They grow on you | they are a different driving experience and different is good from the norm | 
 "words": I finally got my FJ and it has been all I expected and more very civilized ride and comfort yet ruggedly constructed and all this for under 30k I love it | 
 "words": Takes a bit getting used to the blind spots | Love the car to the max | Fun to drive 4X4 is really nice | Have a friend with a Jeep Wrangler and goes toe to toe off road with it and is much more practical | A few things I would improve would be the seats do not have a forward track for the people getting into the back seat | You have to manually move it forward from the front | The rear windows do not go down | Does not seem like a big deal but the wind whips through the truck like crazy | Last thing would be the back window would be nice if it would go down like with the 4 runner | But all in all I would highly recommend this vehicle | BUY IT |
