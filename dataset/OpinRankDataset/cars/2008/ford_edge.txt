 "words": Very practical | Lots of compliments on looks in and out | Ride is a bit stiff with the 20 whl option | Could handle a bit better if your giving up a plush ride | Plenty of go but TERRIBLE mileage for a V6 | How others on here get 23mpg is beyond me when mine doesn't even get 22mpg with cruise on at 60mph on the highway | I get 15city 20highway regularly | Car is too heavy at 4300lbs but strangely the doors are too light and slam shut too easily | Had a problem known to ford with drivers side heat not getting as hot as the passengers | heater core replaced | fixed | Others on here complain about warm A C but strangely mine is mind numbing COLD | I have to turn it down in 95 degree weather often | 
 "words": I've only owned my edge for a couple months | I had a Hyundai elantra and wanted a bigger vehicle since I just had a little girl | I love the room in the edge | I was looking at a few suvs and most of them still looked just as crammed as my car did once I put the car seat in | This crossover has plenty of room for the car seat and plenty of cargo space for my stroller and anything else I might need to take along with me | Also love that it has ac vents in the back so I don't have to worry about my little girl burning up | It's very comfortable even in the back seats | Gas mileage could use some improvement though | I usually get about 22-24 on the highway and about 16-18 in the city |

 "words": I felt compelled to buy an American car due to the current economic crises | This is my first Ford I really liked the exterior design | The car drove good overall the interior is comfortable roomy | After 8 months of ownership I wish I'd bought foreign | While I have had no major issues I feel American cars are still behind in design quality | The AC is pathetic | The driver side does not blow | This is a bad thing in Texas | I inquired the dealership I have my oil changed the service manager told me it was a design flaw they had tons of complaints but there was no fixes for the issue | Not what I wanted to hear | The dashboard gauges are hard to see in low lighting conditions |

 "words": After looking at the Subaru Tribeca Nissan Murano and Mazda CX-7 we decided on an Edge Limited AWD | It compared very well against the competition in build quality styling materials and fit and finish | We belived the exterior styling to be the best of the bunch | The interior shines IMHO with a conservative well designed layout using durable materials and easy intuitive controls | The leather seating is nice with contrast stitching | The backseat felt the most comfortable and roomy of the 4 | The sync system is outstanding with nothing comaprable in any other vehicle we looked at | bluetoothCellsweet | Little extras like puddle lamps and power rear liftgate are nice too | And the price | 
 "words": I think Ford hit the jack pot with this one | The engine is a little noisey when starting off or increasing speed on the highwaythis should be improved | 
 "words": Well where do I start I bought the 08 edge because of the deep discounts and thought what a great deal | I did not know that the radio would not work the tire would blow out and then the transmission would go out all in less than a week | I know that it is under warranty but how would you feel about a new vehicle with this many problems in a short period of time | I lost faith in Ford | 
 "words": Our SEL Ford Edge awd has been fixed 4 times and I smell burning oil again | They replaced seals and whole unit and it still leaks | Ford needs to let us Edge owners know how and when they can solve this problem | 
 "words": The body style was the first thing that caught my eye before I bought a Ford Edge | The overall shape is very pleasing | The height was also a factor for me because I have trouble getting in and out of vehicles that are too low | The interior suits my needs perfectly | I find everything is close at hand and easy to read | The seats are totally comfortable there's plenty of head and foot room | Storage and cargo space is great too | The music system 6 CD changer AM FM radio and MP3 option are very adequate and easy to use | I have yet to look for an option and find that it's missing | The drive-ability is fabulous | Very smooth and easy to park and maneuver | The AWD was a life saver this winter too | 
 "words": I was apprehensive about buying the Edge | The first time we drove it it was noisey and rode real rough SEL Model compared to the other vehicles we were shopping | After we returned a second time and drove a Limited with the 20 wheels we changed our mind | Very nice ride and quiet | Sync audio system is awesome as is the Vista Roof | Getting 20-21mpg around town | Not too bad but better than the estimate given on the sticker | Origionally had some issues with rattles and creeks but were promptly fixed by the selling dealer | 
 "words": I've had my Edge for about a month now but have been eyeing them ever since they first came out in 2007 | It was between this or the Honda CRV and once I drove the Edge the contest was over | I love how much space I have in the Edge | The center console is big enough for me to put my purse in when I don't want to drag it into a store | There are cup holders everywhere | Love the way it looks sporty compared to some other CUV SUVs | I feel very safe in this car | It's definitely bigger than my Civic but not too big to feel like I'm driving a tank | Overall I love this car | 
 "words": No problems until now poor air conditioning good acceleration poor dashboard gauges to evaluate reliability I will wait to put more miles on it but we drive 2000 miles to Texas and no problems
 "words": This is the first SUV I have ever owned and never understood the attraction until now | I have been a continuous Ford owner since I was a teenager and I own a number of Fords including a 1964 T-Bird 1995 Lincoln Mark 8 2002 Lincoln LS V8 2002 T-Bird and now the Edge AWD LTD | This vehicle is comfortable quiet solid and well equipped | The exterior and interior styling is beautiful with the leather interior and it rides like my Lincolns | 
 "words": I am 5'2 and have problems seeing over or around the outside mirrors | It seems as though they are too large for the vehicle | They create a horrible blind spot which makes me very nervous while driving | I have tried raising the seat but then it's difficult to reach the pedals and I crack my knee on the steering column when I get in and out of the vehicle | I ask my boyfriend to drive the car to get his feedback | He is 5'9 and agreed he thought they were larger than normal | He drives a F-150 truck | Prior to owning the Edge I had an Explorer and never had this problem |

 "words": After looking at several models of CUV SUV including Pilot Veracruz CX9 Toyota Highlander we decided that the 3rd row was the dealbreaker and went looking for something smaller | I am so glad we did | We decided on the Limited model with the Sync Sirius 6 cd and the leather interior | I really like the two tone interior and the contrast stitching on the seats | We are just back from an 1800 mile trip and the Edge performed wonderfully | Very comfortable on the long ride and plenty of room | Gas mileage was not great but driving 80 MPH will do that | My first new car in 12 years and glad I'm on the Edge | 
 "words": My husband and I test drove many crossover SUV's when we were searching for a new car and when we happened upon the Edge it was love at first site | It's roomy enough for my husband who is a large guy to sit in either the front or back comfortably and the panaramic sunroof is great | But most importantly it's fun to drive | Keep producing this king of vehicle Ford you hit a homerun with this one |
