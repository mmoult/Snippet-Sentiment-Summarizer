REVIEWS
 "words": I LOVE this car | No regrets on my purchase | Car feels and looks much more expensive then it is | Gotten into some sticky driving situations and it handled awesome | Can hardly wait for the snow | 
 "words": Toyota and Honda is the only thing my wife had ever driven | But unlike myself she is utterly terrified of driving in the snow | She refused the idea of an SUV and neither Honda or Toyota offers an AWD alternative | I suggested a Suburu Legacy and she reluctantly test drove the Legacy 2 | 5I SE | She was hooked within the first 5 miles although we drove it another 50 before returning to the dealership | But the story doesn't end there | The snow would be the real test after all the AWD was the main reason for the purchase | Well after 11 trips in mild to heavy snow she was convinced this was the best purchase she ever made in her life | Yup in her life | Wow | For that she gives it a perfect ten | 
 "words": Purchased two years ago drive 15000 miles a year | Do mostly highway driving and average 26mpg | Zero maintenance issues so far | Very happy with the purchase has certainly proven herself sure footed in all weather conditions | In fact I bought a 2009 Legacy for my wife a year later | 
 "words": This has been a great car for the past year | Very clean look and feels great on the road | 
 "words": I purchased my Legacy with 6400 miles on it | The dealer told me it was a program car and that an executive from Subaru headquarters in Mass drove it | Come to find out it was a rental car | I bought this car because its safety style comfort AWD and because I did not want to be another guy driving in a cookie cutter car Camry Accord | This car has good pick up same as Camry Accord | Same MPG too darn good for AWD | The Subie suspension is great | Nice balance of ride and handling | The boxer engine also is silky smooth and sounds good too | A boxer engine the pistons are horizontally opposed | Same as Porsche boxer design has lower center of gravity better handling best value for its class | 
 "words": I bought a Subaru because I like the performance handling of a German car but wanted the reliability value of a Japanese car | I got exactly that | The only problem in two years has been a dash rattle that the dealer fixed with a foam jam I know but it's not a luxury brand | It would be nice to get over 30 mpg's but the trade-off is outstanding traction performance and safety | Having survived a serious accident safety is a major concern of mine | No regrets here | This is my first Subaru and I know it will be hard to talk myself into buying anything else again | 
 "words": Okay I almost feel guilty for driving this car | I luckily found it used because you don't see a used Subaru very long on the lot especially as nice as this one and I've been looking | I feel bad because it is soooo good | I have two friends who drive new BMW's and I can easily keep up with the Jones' | This car does everything well including looking the part of a luxury sport sedan | Very fun to drive handles well and fuel economy is great for AWD | Speaking of AWD | it is wonderful in the rain | can't wait for snow | I am dating up because this car has hot looks and delivers performance even for a 4 cyl | When I tell people what I paid | they are filled with jealousy | Don't miss out | 
 "words": After one year and 25000 miles I couldn't be happier | I drive 30 to and from work over a 7000 ft mountain summit to a city that has 3 of the top 10 ski resorts in the country within 5 miles | Naturally traction is a concern | After having a Honda Civic Si and snow tires I will never be without quality winter tires again because getting going is one thing stopping is another and the Legacy does both brilliantly when properly equipped | I confidently and safely got where I was going and passed so many 4WD trucks and SUV's I couldn't even venture a guess at a number | I am so glad I bought this car | 
 "words": So far I've owned my Legacy for a little over a month and I have to say it's by far the best car I've ever owned | I was in the market for a car that was great on the highway safe mpg fun to drive since I drive an hour each day to and from work | I will surely be purchasing another Subaru whenever this one bites the dust hopefully a long time from now | I love the sound system was able to tweak the quality of the speakers through my ipod the moonroof is wonderful and the car handles like it's on rails | I highly recommend anyone that wants a great car at a great price pre-owned might be the way to go | Low miles for 5k cheaper than new a year old | be stupid not to | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 used Subaru Legacy with 20000 miles on it in March 2009 | The only complaint I have is that after I drive it and then turn the engine off it makes a ticking sound for approx 20 secs as though the engine is cooling down | I never heard this sound in other cars I've owned so it's new to me | I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem and if it's common | The dealer said it's the engine cooling but I'm leery of it | The engine sounds more like a cheap car and is not as quiet when started or when driving | I've owned a Honda and Dodge Intrepid and they seemed more sturdier than the Subaru Legacy | 
 "words": While the 3 | 0R boasts a larger engine and more hp it actually has less lb foot of torque than its 2 | 5GT counterpart | translating to 7 tenths of a second from 0-60 | The acclaimed S I drive is amusing if not practical | In sport mode acceleration is noticeably boosted from intelligent mode | Paddle-shifting is also available in sport sharp though its more burdensome than liberating | Paddle-shift levers S I drive console and Navigation system all contribute to the impressive interior | Even after the romance fades the controls are insightful and convenient | This car may be your best choice if a | you drive in all-weather conditions b | you purchase used at a discount
 "words": I was lucky enough to get the last '08 on the lot and I got leather heated seats heated mirrors heated wipers 6 disc changer and auto climate control | This is easily the nicest car I've ever owned | Fit and finish and quality of materials is amazing | My girlfriend's mom has a 328xi and I honestly think this car is nicer inside and out | Bottom line try a Legacy before you go for an Audi BMW or Lexus | you may be surprised | 
 "words": I waited to post a review of this car until we had time to really evaluate it | After 9 mos | nearly 11K miles we are very satisfied | The interior is the best period | Its design looks better than any luxury sedan on the market | Handling is very good but you give up a soft ride for it | We average about 30 mpg at 80 mph and 23 around town | Still feels solid and has been totally trouble free | We drove Audi A4 BMW 3 Jag X Volvo S40 S60 | Simply this car felt better and looked better too | If you want an awd car that is reliable economical and near luxury this is the one | Leather is nice stereo is okay but wish it had steering mounted controls fixed in 2009 | Highly recommend | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 Legacy in mid 2007 and it has been hands down the best vehicle I've owned | Its hard to find a high quality sedan that's not too large | The interior is quiet and materials are superior to others | The design is perfect everything is proportional unlike so many new sedans that look different to get attention | I always buy new cars and this is the first one to go the first 20k miles without even one tiny minor little thing to look into | It's been fantastic and I'll definitely buy another | 
 "words": The Subaru Legacy 2 | 5l boxer engine has to be one of the better small size engines on the market today | Besides delivering almost 30 mpg on the high way it can pack a little punch if pushed to its limits | It's more fun to drive than anything I test drove which included Toyota awd matrix Nissan altima Honda accord | The all wheel drive is superb | Anything from heavy rains to deep snow is no match for the symmetric all wheel drive | Last its not cheap by any means but for what you get it is one hell of a deal | 
 "words": Great car for Colorado | Does great in the snow and I get good MPG | I can chase BMW Xis and Audi A4s all day to the ski resorts I might not be as fast as they are but I can handle all the sludge on the road with easy and knowing that I can buy 2 Subarus for the price of one BMW or Audi it makes me smile when i park next to them | Great everyday car at a price that doesn't make you hate yourself every month | I think it will hold its value better as well | I'm getting 27 mpg with a space box on the roof | Would recommend this car to anybody that needs AWD | 
 "words": The Spec B is a great low profile performance sedan | The Euros can't match the performance or reliability for the money | Add snow tires the stock Bridgestones are summer only for winter and you have an unstoppable all season sport sedan | Having owned a Mercedes C230 and a BMW 328i I can say the Subaru is much more fun to drive | 
 "words": I just drove my Legacy that I bought in April in snow for the first time and it is unbelievable | My driveway had over a foot of snow in the driveway and I just plowed right through it | Can't put a price on that | I've been very pleased with this car since the day I bought it but seeing it perform in these conditions makes me LOVE this car | 
 "words": When I bought an Acura TL a year ago the Legacy was my second choice | I recently reversed that decision and traded the TL for the Suby | What a difference | I love the sports car handling and the AWD because I live in a part of Canada that gets a lot of snow in winter | It's the first car I've looked forward to driving every day since I sold my Miata | Acceleration is impressive in sport sharp mode | My TL had crazy dangerous torque steer when accelerating hard in corners | The Suby is tight predictable with a slight rear wheel bias | The interior looks great and fits me well except for the arm rest needed to get the extender | Bluetooth would be nice but shouldn't talk on the phone anyway | 
 "words": Excellent AWD sport sedan | Very quick over a wide variety of road surfaces and conditions | Sport sharp mode in Si drive provides great throttle response | A stealth car that is great fun to drive | 
 "words": I have owned Subarus for several years mostly WRXs | I finely decided to try a Legacy GT | I am really glad I did | It is a great car having good power and more luxury than the WRXs I owned | Subaru has done a great job on the entire design and functionality of the Legacy GT | I have added a Stage one Cobb Accessport and it changed an already good performing car into a really GREAT performing car | The added hp torque from this programmer really changes the entire character of the engine without cutting the mpg | It's the best 695 | 00 I ever spent | 
 "words": Have owned Lexus LS Toyota Camrys and Corolla BMW 3 5 Z4 series and Honda Civic | Hadn't ever looked at Subaru before but researched sedans with top safety ratings and the Legacy stood out | I have had the car for 2 days and am very pleased with how well it was designed and built | Very well appointed great value above average performance even providing a bit of luxury but without being pretentious in any way | Fuel economy like a small SUV requires premium gas and frequent oil changes | More fun than a Camry Corolla or Accord Civic but just as practical and more bang for your buck than Lexus or BMW | 
 "words": I leased this car back in Dec | 2008 I got the silver one | In So Cal it is rare to see one in a week | Even Subaru owners here don't know what it is they think it is a BMW | I love the look of the car the solid drive and very quiet I can actually listen to the radio at number 4 | I am 6'2'' and I fit with with headroom to spare this is the first car that I can have a moon roof | When you push this car in the corners you can feel how well it handles | The trunk is a good size | 
 "words": I love this vehicle snow rain ice whatever the world throws at you it handles | I autocross and it is impressive there | On the highway I avg 32 mpg hills 28 | I love it and recommend it
 "words": I was hoping to get a nicer car but with gas prices exceeding 4 a gallon I didn't want to be getting 17 mpg so I leased this Subaru Legacy for 2 years at an excellent rate | It gives me an average of 31 | 2 mpg overall and it has decent kick for a 4 cyl | I also own a 2003 Forrester but is noisy on the highway this car is solid very little road noise | I only got the VDC because that's all there was I mainly turn it off | The leather is nice and along with the wood trim it makes the car feel much more than 26k | The only complaint is that its a bit small | Wishing I bought it so I don't have to worry about mileage much better then expected D
 "words": Excellent Car | Handles well well built better gas miles than expected for an AWD 25 in traffic | Looks Sharp | Best car for the money | Other cars you pay so much more for AWD moonroof leatherauto dimming mirror fog light and on board computer | 
 "words": I've owned Audis BMWs VWs and I looked at them all again before buying Subaru | It's got push-you-back-in-the-seat power stealthy looks and features that costs lots more on the other brands | I couldn't be happier with it | Very high Fun To Drive factor and is always ready to do more | Handles great in the snow as well | When I'm nice to it I get 31 MPG hwy when I'm not 20 22 | It's a nice surprise and everyone asks me what kind of car it is when they see it on the road | Big difference between standard legacy and legacy GT | It's worth the difference in price | 
 "words": I've owned this car for 6 months and it is great I am very impressed | I've owned foreign and domestic cars and this is the best by far | I averaged 25 | 8 MPG mixed city and highway over 7000 miles | The controls are well thought out and the car is very comfortable | Test drive it and you will not be disappointed | 
 "words": Once I drove the Legacy I completely fell in love with it | It takes away from all other cars including Hondas Mazdas and Toyotas | This car is in its own class you really can't compare it to any others many people think the car looks way more expensive then it actually is | I get great gas mileage better then they say | I average 28-29 MPG with 75 highway and 25 city | I can't go anywhere with out people asking me what kind of car I drive | The Legacy is so comfortable and the handling is great | I would recommend this car to anyone | Before buying any other car you must test drive the Subaru Legacy | I swear you won't regret it |

 "words": Well I Trade in My GMC Envoy for this one and I have to say that my chances of going to GM won't be happening anytime soon for sure unless it's a Caddy or somthing like that | This is the best car I have ever owned after the going though so many problems with my Envoy which is a okay | I never had so much fun driving car other than this one | My fuel mileage is not so great yet but I have only had this car for 4 days so the engine needs time to break in | I think in time the fuel mileage will get better and it already better than my SUV | I love going around conners and I can't wait for the Saskatchewan winters | That's when this car is going to show it strips with it AWD |

 "words": This car is OK nothing special it was a cheap lease | I had a VW Golf which blows the Subaru away in overall performance and quaility | The Subaru doors close like a tin can power in the engine is non-exsitent and the road noise is high | But it is new and get about 24 MPG not bad for an AWD

 "words": 1000 miles so far | Overall this is a quality car | I traded a Mazda 3 | I thought I would miss the zoom-zoom factor but there is adequate acceleration and I think the Legacy actually responses better when passing others on the freeway | Plenty of room on the inside | Clean straightforward dash layout | Only problem I had was deciding on the Limited or GT | 
 "words": I bought my Subaru Legacy about 3 months ago and I must say its a very great car for the price | I'ts the 4 cylinder Special Edition version | It has plently of power to merge on the highway and pass | It handles great at high speeds | I can only imagine what the GT version is like if this one has this much performance | I get 25mpg and thats 90 city driving | Highway I can get about 30mpg | I push it a lot since im a college student and love to accelerate | AWD is great in the rain can't wait for the winter to really test it out again | Overall great car and I would recommend it to anyone | Good quality all around |

 "words": I drive 60 miles day near DC and looked for a car that was safe reliable fuel efficient winter friendly and unique | I looked at Audi A4 Audi A3 Saab 9-3 Volvo S40 and the Subaru Legacy | They were all comparable cars but I bought the Subaru 2 | 5i Limited with spoiler moonroof visor mudguards subwoofer | The Subaru is by far the best deal | no comparison |

 "words": This is the first new car I have ever bought | Fun to drive and looks very stylish | I definitely get looks from other drivers | The fuel economy is marginal at best | 
 "words": I originally looked at this car as it was the best price for the amenities | 5 Star safety power everything AWD 4 cyl gas mileage plus it has the history of Subaru quality | What I found out after I drove it was that I not only lost the bad mileage of a V6 but I gained the nice power of a 4 cyl Boxer engine | I have no problem getting onto highways passing I even safely avoided an accident with the car's superior handling | If you're looking for something safe but don't want to feel like you're trading your youth then this car is a must to test drive | 
 "words": There are several AWD vehicles on the market but none come close to the value that the Legacy offers | Lexus Volvo Audi all cost thousands more and Ford's AWD sedans are bland | This is my first Subaru and there's no buyer's remorse here | Still I wish the manual transmission were more available | 
 "words":  After I drove the 08 Legacy | The decision to buy was easy | My first Subaru but definitely not the last | Test drove several others | 
 "words": I'm driving 120 miles day and looked for a solid ride that could get me past 150k miles w o costing me too much | I wanted all wheel drive and I didn't want to defer to the Hondas and Toyotas mainly because they bore me and you see them everywhere | I was contemplating spending some bigger bucks for the Audi A4 or the Infiniti G35x | Obviously those cars are much quicker but when I found out that the Legacy had comparable interior as comfortable a ride and was much cheaper I decided to go with the Subaru | When compared to the others that were mentioned I sacrificed speed for cheaper gas parts insurance monthly payments and increased mpg | 
 "words": So far so good | Moved into the SUBI world from a pontiac grand prix gtp | I love the AWD the overall looks internal and external | Could use a wee bit more power but all in all you really cant beat the price for a brand new 4 door sedan | I bought a 2008 Pearl White Legacy 2 | 5i se | Sharp car rides awesome could use some better gas mileage but i give this car a 8 | 5 outta 10 | 
 "words": I drove my Mustang from California to Boston and once winter hit knew that I needed a new car | I was looking at a lot of options and then someone suggested looking at a Subaru | I LOVE this car | It's sporty enough for me yet at the same time provides the safety and comfort of a luxury car twice it's price | The AWD is second to none and the ride is unbelievably smooth | Everybody who asks me about this car is shocked to find out it's not a 40k luxury car | It's THAT eye-catching | Subaru has found itself a new loyal customer | 
 "words": I got my GT back in May and can't ask for anything more | I have wanted the car since 1998 back before it didn't even have the turbo | It was sure worth the wait as it drives like a dream | I take it up in the mountains and it just hugs the curves as it slices up the road | Subaru really stepped up their interior quality for this year | I get compliments from everyone who gets in it | 
 "words": After owing German performance sedans for the past 15 years I test drove the 2008 Legacy 2 | 5 GT Limited with the 2 | 5 turbo boxer four mated with the five-speed automatic trans | I absolutely loved the car | It looked good | The interior was well-appointed | The steering was precise | The handling was exceptional | The ride was very good | The engine was surprisingly responsive and powerful | The price was extremely competitive | The only negative is the automatic transmission | The gear changes are sluggish and delayed | Even when manually changing gears with the paddle shifter there is significant delay | If not for the auto trans it gets all 10s | 
 "words": Just bought it | already have a 100 miles on it and I am very impressed | I have owned an Audi A6 2 | 7T VW GTI and GLX a Maxima 3 | 5L SE and my other car is a '02 WRX | This car is one of the best I have driven especially for the price | If I wasn't looking at the Subaru badge I would have sworn I was driving a BMW or an Audi dashboard leather seats etc | This car is great on the highway and still firm enough to have fun on the twisty roads | I was averaging 28 mpg on the highway with a new engine with less than 100 miles | Germany should be afraid with the performance of the Legacy and the proven reliability of Subaru | I recommend a test drive of the GT you will not be disappointed

 "words": I test drove the '08 Saab Aero Volvo C70 Accord WRX and a few others and the Legacy blew them away in every way | Performance handling style and pricing | I've had it for about a month and recently had the cold air intake heat shield and Cat-back system installed | With this system this little engine actually sounds like a real muscle car | It is a true sleeper that I've surprised many a driver with already | I feel like I stold the car getting it for 30k | Well worth the investment | 
 "words": I have traded in my Accord Ex for the 2008 Legacy Limited with VDC | The Legacy is by far a much better vehicle than the Accord | The Accord is a good ride but it can't match the Legacy in handling and in acceleration | The steering feels very balance in the AWD Legacy | you don't have the torque steer kickback of a front wheel drive car | The gas mileage is about the same as the Accord which is quite good | The 4 speed auto transmission works well with the 2 | 5 engine | I have no problem merging into the freeways and zipping aound town | The ride is very comfortable and controlled | I have owned many brands MB BMW Acura Honda Jeep Nissan and the Legacy is the best car for the money | 
 "words": The power windows are too slow | The AC system modulates too frequently and never seems to get cold | Gas mileage is not that good | However the fun to drive especially for a 4 banger is pretty decent | 
 "words": I have been looking for an AWD Japanese sedan with a manual transmission for a few years after having an Audi A6 and then a BMW 325xi both with reliablility issues | Subaru finally had enough of the amenities with the 2008 Limited GT Turbo model for me to make the purchase | What a value | The car is more fun to drive than the BMW much faster and hopefully will be more reliable | With discounts and rebates the car is approximately 12000 less than a similarly equipped 2008 325xi | The car handles really nicely much easier clutch than the BMW | I've had it now for 2 months and absolutely no regrets | I added an aftermarket bluetooth kit which fit nicely in the space for the navigation | 
 "words": Researched small AWD sport sedans for over 3 months and drove the Audi A4 BMW 328i Acura TSX Lexus IS 250 and Volvo 2 | 5 | The Legacy GT out performs all of them at a price that is 10000 less than the 3 series | Build quality is superb and the ride is extremely quiet for a 3200 pound sedan | The negatives are the rear seat is a tad firm but more than adequate for anyone less than 6 feet on an all day trip and lack of storage compartments | This is my second Subaru the first being a forester which has 71000 miles on it and has been trouble free | The Legacy GT is quick quiet and handles superbly a truly remarkable car at an attractive price compared to its competition | 
 "words": We found this car to have the best turning ratio out there and the four wheel drvie exceeds all our expectations | Purchased the Limited to get the stability control system for added confidence | The dark brown color with the high metallic flake is awesome | Standard competitors lost us in favor of the Legacy uniqueness and safety at the best overall value and price of those other cars shopped | 
 "words": Traded in '02 WRX on '08 Legacy GT | The GT is roomier with much better features leather sunroof auto AC auto trunk XM auto mirror much quieter and only cost 2K more than my WRX did 6 years ago | As quick as my WRX 0-60 same cornering G but simply not as fun to drive | However this is a much easier car to live with quiet and everybody who rides in it loves it | Quality is same or better than WRX outstanding | Other than for clutch never had a problem with the WRX in 75K miles never even touched the brakes | I'm looking forward to a similar experience with the Legacy GT | 
 "words": Purchased an 08 LGT 5m about a month ago | So far the car has been great | I give it good mpg ratings as my current truck gets about 11 mpg | I was really surprised to get 26 | 8 mpg on a 360 mile trip on country roads driving somewhat spirited this was before the motor has even broken in | I really like the solid quiet interior | The perforated leather seats are great and supportive | Clutch feel is solid thus far and is very easy to drive |

 "words": I have owned two Audis and one VW over the last several years and gave up that family due to reliability problems with all three cars | The GT seems like a car with many of the features of the Audi world for less money | Interior is certainly better than most cars in its class but not quite up to Audi VW standards | Performance still unsure about the automatic transmission | This is my first automatic in several years and I'm having trouble adjusting | It's nice when stuck in traffic but it does take some of the fun out of the car | The paddle shifters help make up for some of that | even when in drive you can quickly downshift without having to change into manualmatic mode | 
 "words": This is my second Subaru I traded in my Forester when I moved 90 minutes from work as I wanted more creature comforts for the long commute | This car does not disappoint | Smooth ride great gas mileage and the Limited's upgraded interior makes the trip comfortable as well | Plus when winter hits if the AWD works as well as it did in the Forester I'm all set | 
 "words": I just traded my beloved 05 WRX wagon in due to a foot injury that made shifting the manual trans difficult | I was looking at the 6-cyl 3 | 0R model then I drove it | really slow | The 2 | 5GT was quite a bit faster but still much slower than my WRX | Ah well the Legacy IS a heavier car and it has an auto trans | I do like the 5-speed auto for what it's worth and the paddle shifters are a cool touch | The SI-Drive feature is a bit gimmicky really as the three different maps aren't too much different | You still need to put your foot down to get good speed with the Sport Sharp mode | Interior quality is top-notch and the ride is smooth and quiet otherwise | Happy to own my second Subie | 
 "words": Car so far seems very solid takes the curves very nice | We are looking for mileage and safe driving in bad weather |

 "words": Replacing a truly wonderful Mazda 6S I resisted the Outback wagons opting instead for the understated 2 | 5i limited sedan | The ride is unusually smooth and the center of gravity very low | I'm most surprised by the transmission however | Though its only a 4 speed it's got enough low end torque for darting around town and an easy relaxed cruising gear | I get 29 mpg average impressive especially considering the AWD | Inside it's in another class compared to the competition quiet elegant and everything is within easy reach and the jewel-like instrument cluster is very classy | But best of all the symmetrical AWD is just incredible and has a well-deserved reputation | 
 "words": This is a great car rides smooth corners well sounds great | Can't wait to open her up after the 1K mile break- in period with the Sport Sharp mode | Everywhere I go people are asking What's that | and are amazed at not only the style but the features performance and out-the-door cost | This is my first Subie and I think I'm going to be a lifelong customer | 
 "words": Been car shopping for a long long time | Looked at almost everything out there MBs BMWs Evos Stis etc | Saw an 06 LGT spec B and wasn't completely sold on the interior color | When the 07s came out I was disappointed by the blue inserts | 08 rolled around and finally an all black interior | So far with about 500 miles on it I am still happy | With the 6spd I am having problems finding the right gear at the right time used to 5 spds | 1st and 2nd seem kinda gutless | It's annoying to have keep putting the car into sport sharp | 
 "words": Owned and loved a 2 | 5RS since '97 | Very agile car and wonderful off roads but it had missing features when the kids came folding seats tiny backseat latches high profile trunk cargo nightmare stripped interior | Looked at the 328ix LS 350 Evo STi TT G35 6s | All great but the spec | b outperformed and had everything I wanted on my RS | The WRX's older brother a lot of punch with significantly more sophistication | Interior features and ride make this a serious luxury car with a kick | The spec | b was not designed to be as rugged as the RS my off trail days on hold | but I'm very happy with my purchase and ecstatic now that I've had it for 6 weeks and booked 4-digit miles 
 "words": I love this car | I looked at many cars over several weeks and decided that the Subaru Legacy was the best value for performance safety and comfort | The car is quiet smooth and so elegant inside | I have so much fun driving the car | It has the handling of a European sedan and the reliability of a Japanese car | I recently drove the car during heavy rain and flooding it maintained its stability like a tank | I'm very happy with my decision | If you are considering an Accord or Camry don't make a decision until you try the Legacy | You'll be shocked by the difference | 
 "words": What a great car | My wife and I have been looking for a car for her for quite some time | We tested MB C Class BMW 3s and Audi A4s | The Subaru by far out classed them on the roadways | Its handling in our opinion matched or outperformed the others | Its comfort is amazing and the power is wonderful | The 243 HP feels strong and you never need more | The car handles superbly at highway speeds and is even better in the curves | What a great car and I would recommend it to anyone | My next car will definitely be a Subaru |

 "words": I just traded my 2006 Xterra for this Subaru | Big difference so I won't even try to compare the two | However I did recently trade in my Mazda 6s and I must say that the Subaru is almost every bit as fun to drive as the Mazda | The Subaru has a few points going for it over the Mazda | 1 | All Wheel Drive 2 | I'm not constantly worrying that the automatic transmission is going to overheat and destroy itself | 3 | The Subaru's transmission computer is adaptive to the driver | The Mazda had pre-selected shift points that forced the car in overdrive before the RPMs even matched the gearing of the car | Besides the car would never downshift while slowing down | Subaru has won my business | 
 "words": Went to dealer with wife to have the 05 ob xt ltd serviced and walked out with a new 08 spec B | First one the dealer had | Probably the first one in the area too | We both fell in love with it | It can be compared to a BMW 328xi but 10000 cheaper | Ride is firm and tight yet smooth even with the 18 inch summer performance tires | Clutch and shifter silky smooth | Handles great | Sticks like glue on turns | Power in stong | Can get out of the way in 6th gear | Everything is where it should be right at your finger tips | Radio and navi are wonderful | This is my 6th subie and definitely the best one |
