REVIEWS
 "words": 16K miles in and it's my 4th trip to the dealership to the address the Fuel Economy issue | A hybrid that can't get more than 18 MPG in the city | It's a Joke | Here is why | GM Hybrid technology is faulty | Ford got theirs from Toyota and the Escape gets 30 MPG my neighbor has one that's not a Joke | Maybe it's because it's a Mild Hybrid and GM never got to the full hybrid or plug in as expected | 
 "words": Not being a full hybrid getting good milage out of this car really depends on the driver and how much they drive | If your making infrequent short trips your looking at an average of 20-22MPG | The killer is not running 100 off electricity at lower speeds | This was a used 2008 I got for a steal 18990 for hybrid with only 9000 miles and leather sunroof etc | The previous reading had 20 | 7MPG for the average | Probably why they sold it so quick | I cleared this and was at 30 | 1MPG myself by the time I got home 60 miles | That took work my guess is 26-28MPG with my usual driving style | Thats definately not bad for a SUV and better than my 4cyl Altima which was around 24 | 8 | 
 "words": We purchsed the Saturn Vue Hybrid in September of 2008 and love it | Very comforable to drive -quiet interior | We are averaging 27 city and 33 on the highway | We have 10k miles on it and no problems so far | One tip we got nitogen in the tires on the last oil change and it helped with fuel economy | 
 "words": i bought a 2008 vue hybrid in 9 08 | The car is nice trims and style are great but two standout issues so far | First it was the roof racks there are none and no optin for the Vue Hybrid | Thule makes one but its 500 dollars and needs to be custom installed | Second mileage I've avg'd 23 | 3 MPG that's the best so far driving everyday | Granted i drive a little fast and due to new locale often in a city mpg mode but even on long highway trips still avg the same mileage just not worth it | Additonal draw backs no AWD bad in winter rain transmission vibrations in cold start weather lack of pickup by 4cyl | All said I tried us car and i'm going back to foreigns
 "words": I have my vue for 5 months its great fun to drive and if you are single like me a chick magnet | people love the design and the burgandie color look just great 100 recomended 
 "words": I bought the hybrid Vue 6 months ago | Average 28 MPG city and 33 highway with a modest driving style | I keep tire pressure at 40 and get better mileage | I love the battery assist engine shutoff at stop signs lights and load carrying capacity | Plenty of roominess in rear seats and in cargo area | I've let the XM subscription expire | there's enough good radio locally | Ride is very comfortable handling is great | Front seats are comfy with good view reach of all instruments | 
 "words": I am pleased so far with my VUE have had it for about 6 weeks | Real world mileage is 26 around town and on two short trips averaged 31 | Very good for a 3800lbs vechile | For the price compared to other hybrids it's a great deal wish GM would extend this BAS technology to other vechiles in their line 
 "words": I had my Vue for aout 4 weeks before it started acting up rough idle no start etc | I brought it to the shop 4 weeks ago and they have resolved nothing not to mention have no leads on the problem as I drive around in a lender car that is full of dog pee hair | Stay away from this product | It took the dealership 4 weeks to get the car to act up as had described | The most unreliable car on the road today | Buyer Beware | Also important to note that thus far Saturn GM has taken no additional steps to remedy the situation | Telling me that this is why there is an initial purchase Warranty | I will never again step foot in or near this vehicle | 
 "words": With the price of fuel never to go back down I traded my van for better mileage | I used it for extra room for the things that I needed to carry on weekends and such | I was looking for something with room comfort and better mileage and found it with the Vue-Hybrid | Just drive one and you will be sold | 
 "words": Just picked up my new 2008 Vue Hybrid it took 6 months from date of order | I drove a Ford Explorer before and the Vue is a big improvement in terms of mileage | Just a touch smaller but works for me | 
 "words": After researching minivans SUV's and sedans for almost two years we decided to purchase a hybrid VUE | We had a Saturn SL2 before and decided to stick with Saturn for their customer service and reliability | Would have looked closer at a hybrid Hilander but they are very expensive | Came down to VUE and Escape hybrid and the VUE was a little cheaper | I love the outdoors and will always have a bigger four wheel drive for my hobbies that we can take the family on trips so we needed something a little bigger that we could fit a larger stroller and the dog for everyday driving but still get decent MPG | This vehicle fit all of our needs and we are expecting to get close to the same MPG as SL2
 "words": Overall I'm very satisfied with the vehicle | I originally wanted to buy a full hybrid instead of this mild hybrid but it was the only US made hybrid that was available | I'm now glad I got this because for the money its a better deal | I'm all for the environment but if you need a vehicle now this is the SUV with the highest highway mileage available period | When the next generation comes out and gets 70 mpg I'll be all over it | But that will be a couple of years | 
 "words": I researched hybrids for months looked for a Mazda Tribute Ford Escape hybrid couldn't find one and bought a Vue instead | I like firm seating back support so the Vue's seats are comfortable | The driver's seat 8 way adjustments support are perfect for me 5'6 and my husband 6'2 | The Vue is quiet has a smooth ride and controls are conveniently located | There's a perfect spot on the dash for my beanbag GPS mounting unit and we easliy located my EZ-Pass transmitter so that I can't see it | Gas mileage has been good and in light of gas prices this was the smartest purchase I could have made | I drove a Tribute AWD for almost 5 years and liked it but the Vue is much better | 
 "words": Purchased for wife after typically driving more expensive vehicles BMW's and never setting foot in a Saturn dealership | The new Saturn styling is much more appealing then previous models | We inquired about the avail of the hybrid the day the Charlotte dealership had 3 arrive with 2 already sold | Definitely impressed with the interior and exterior look and feel | I guess I was expecting a lesser product | Unlike other hybrids the addt'l expense seemed nominal for the economy trade-off and the cool hybrid badges | The vehicle has a nice tight feel to it and handles nicely | Acceleration has a lot to be desired but probably in line with what you should expect from this size engine
 "words": We spent several months researching and decided on the Vue | The vehilce is tight and rides very well not too soft nor to stiff | Fit and finish are very good | Interior layout very convenient | We drive the Chesapeake Bay Bridge under repair and the Vue is very smooth | Shifting is smooth and quick enough for our liking | Initial gas mileage appears as advertised | Fold down seats are easy to operate | 
 "words": I love the style and the performance | But the seats are made for persons of small body types | I am 5-11 inches and weigh 250lbs | The seats are just not comfortable | The dealer says there are no other seats available to switch to | All Saturns have the same seat with different upholstery | I am looking to trade it off | What good is performance if you can't get comfortable enough to enjoy the ride | 
 "words": Just took delivery 2wks ago | great gas mileage so far and mild hybrid is much more sensible cost efficient than full hybrids out there | VUE has terrific ride looks and safety | Test drove RAV4 CRV Escape and Equinox | Most were nice but VUE was best by far especially green line hybird version | Owned an Escape previously as well as a Corolla and this beats then all |
