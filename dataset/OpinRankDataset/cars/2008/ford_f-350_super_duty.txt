 "words": i have 7000 miles on the 6 | 4 | it has lots of power | anyone that owns one get a 4 inch ext | tuner and you will not have any problems | the reason some are is that these engines r so restricted back because of the govt these engines need to breath just like us and their not letting them | dont believe me go buy a 08 dodge cummins its having the same problems | so its not ford dodge or chevy | these engines produce so much horse power and torque that with resrtictions its hurting more than helping | so what im saying is help out your engines | i deal w them everyday look at the engine prior to 2003 and they all era great thats because govt | wasnt involved

 "words": I want to fist say that I have the King Ranch and it has the most amazing leather package that I have ever seen | Next it is not entirely Ford's fault regarding fuel economy | In 2008 the EPA mandated DPF filters on all diesel trucks resulting in horrible fuel economy | The radiator issue is a recall and I had mine replaced at 35k since then I had no problems | Towing I tow a 38ft 12k fifth wheel and live in Colorado high altitude | The DPF while in regen will increase EGTs resulting in the turbo fans to go off and sometimes resulting in the truck going into limp mode | I find this to be this trucks serious flaw |

 "words": I have just purchased this vehicle | Performance is excellent and ride is great | I know that people are concerned about the fuel economy | This truck is a job build 3 | I would have to tell anyone that is looking for reasonable fuel economy and need a truck this Ford will do the job | I have the diesel with the 3 | 55 rear end | I only have 1000 miles of use but I was able to get 19 | 3 MPG driving 60 MPH | Remember the diesel will show a MPG improvement after about 10K | The Super Duty will make a excellent truck for anyone needing a truck for work | I also believe those getting bad MPG are running 4 | 10 gears and also drive just to fast to maximize MPG |
