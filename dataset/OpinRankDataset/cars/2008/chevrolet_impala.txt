REVIEWS
 "words": Just turned in my 2007 Impala SS | It was a fantastic car | Took on a few cross country long trips and clocked 27mpg on the hwy | The car always performed perfectly and had real power when I needed it | My new 2008 from the dealer demo with 6000 mi | is similar to the old one | Not much change and the 2010 are virtually the same so | I went for the deal | I will continue to buy this venue of car American all the way before spending thousands more on a foreign hottie which really can't compare to the American Impala SS | The price is right and the feel is right both in the car itself and the American pride | step on it | 
 "words": I bought my 08 Impala Lt 3 | 5 V6 used with nearly 26000 miles on it | It was in pristine shape | It runs good ONLY execpt for my excessive tire alignment problems that the factory warranty wont cover | Yea the bumper to bumper the covers almost everything | Other than those minor problems and the lagging power of the V6 i think it was a great buy | 
 "words": Bought with 34000 miles on the clock | Immediately set off on a 5744 mile round trip to east coast from WA State | Amazed at 32 | 3 average mpg received with cruise set at 70 mph where possible | Several tanks at 34 | Some heavy head winds in SD and MT on return reduced economy | The suspension is too soft for my taste with excessive body roll on cornering at higher speeds though ride was very comfortable | As others have stated the side mirrors are on the small side for total safety | Power is more than adequate with the 3 | 5 liter V-6 | Fit and finish both inside and out is very good | Trunk carried dog crate cooler and all our bags with room to spare | I am very satisfied with this car | 
 "words": replaced 2000 Jaguar S Type 3 | 0 | Needed more leg room and a larger trunk | Miss my memory seat steering | The build quality is as good as any import I have owned Jaguar Volvo Infinity etc | 
 "words": I bought this car for work | The Trunk is great I have to carry a lot of equipment and it is nice | I have the SS which has the V8 | On the highway it get 25-26 avg MPG | It switches from 4 cylinder to 8 cylinder smoothly which a was concerned about before I bought the car | The Ltz owner I read the review must not drive but to his mailbox and back to get 17 avg | My 2004 GMC has better avg MPG than that in the summer | 
 "words": I traded in a Mariner that was having drivetrain problems | My car was a leftover at the end of 08 | I drove it and fell in love | The front seats are spacious and very comfortable | The car has the gusto to pull past just about any other car I need to within reason | I do wish that I had the 3 | 9L engine as I have added a hitch and the 3 | 5 seems a bit underpowered on uphill stretches having to rev around 2500 RPMs to maintain speed | My only two complaints are the cup holders | I can't fit a large cup from anywhere in with any other cup | Smaller cups and bottles fit fine but on long road trips who wants a small | Also I have been in the shop for brake pulsations twice in 1 year | 
 "words": i have a ltz chevy impala very nice car I think the trunk is too large making this car extra large | The MPG is very low I just can reach 17 mpg even in highway making the company statement a big fat lie | I had try it everything to increase the mpg but still making the same other than that i thing it is a nice car to have it | Thanks
 "words": I just purchased a 2008 Impala LT with 33000 miles on it and it's one of the best cars I ever owned | The car runs great | I needed a dependable roomy car for my daily 75 mile round trip to work and after doing a lot of research focused on the Impala | After finding a great deal I jumped on it | It's a great value compared to other cars in it's class | I would by another one without hesitation | Every time I drive it confirms that I made an excellent choice | The performance could be a little better when accelerating from a complete stop and the side view mirrors could have been a little bigger but over all I am thrilled with my purchase | I would recommend the car highly | 
 "words": Originally I set out to buy an loaded LTZ with a bench seat BOSE sound system and sunroof in mocha brown | But after taking the SS model for a spin just to see what it could do I was sold | Before purchasing this car I did test drive other sport sedans all of them costing much more and nothing was funner to drive than the Impala SS | The Jewel dark cherry monochromatic red compliments the car and is worth the extra cost | I added low profile tires wheels and tinted the windows all around | It's a good looking car and inexpensive to decorate | 
 "words": We turned in a Cadillac DTS and got the Impala | It has as large a trunk as the caddy and the rear seats fold as well | The seats could be improved and the a c controls are silly but the ride and comfort approach the best | Looked at all the rivals and this was the beat for the money | Have had GM products for thirty years and the reliability has been tremendous | For the money this is the best buy | 
 "words": The 08 impala lt drives great | I stepped down owning a Mercedes-Benz C-class for 8 years | The Impala is very quiet smooth shifting and I like the styling and space | Mileage is excellent and it uses regular gas | I am used to that other motorists look at you while driving a Mercedes-Benz same thing happens with the new Impala | Love that car | 
 "words": I am so glad we to Chevy to try out an Impala | We'd been test-driving Toyota Camrys and Nissan Altimas | But we finally went to Chevy and we really liked the Impala | So we bought the Chevy Impala and for less than a base Camry | Now I realize how flimsy the Camry and Altima were | The quality of the Chevy Impala is far superior | And with the 3 | 5L V6 we've attained 26 MPG in the city and 33 on the highway far better than the window sticker said | I'm glad I didn't fall for the Japanese foriegn car hype | If you don't believe it go test drive an Impala and compare | There are plenty of old Chevy's and Fords driving around and they are easier and cheaper to fix | Most cars last with care | 
 "words": I can't say enough about this car | I factory ordered the LTZ model black on black with cloth seating as I don't like leather and the metallic trim on the inside instead of the base woodgrain trim | This car is my dream | 18 Wheels that stand out and look like I went out and custom bought them | Two large exhaust tubes sporting stainless steel tips | I tried to create a great sports car with this vehicle and I succeded by putting two thick stripes running from to back as well as chroming out the front and rear chevrolet logo over the default gold | A sound system is my only future plan for this vehicle as it turns heads no matter where it goes | I just want to drive it | 
 "words": I've heard from so many people that American made automobile is not good as Japaness made | That might be true | It may sound strange | My teenage daughter wanted to buy this Impala SS not Japaness or other imports | She said I love Chevy | Driven about 7000 miles so far and there was no problem at all | Excellent performancelike my Trailblazer SS | Great gas mileage for V8 engineover 21 mpg with mixed driving | Very comfy and smooth ride | This Impala's interior may lack refinement than some foreign car's | But can they bring a car with roaring V8 under 30000 | 
 "words": This is my 4th Impala | This car is the best so far | It has less road noise and better exterior looks | You get a lot of bang for the bucks | I just wish they would hold a little more resale value | 
 "words": After the HHR this thing is like 100 times better | It rides smooth as silk | The shifting is really smooth | It has a really nice pickup and just plain comfortable to drive around in | One of the best cars I have had | 
 "words": I have been driving GM cars for 50 years and they have been good except for this model | Very uncomfortable bumpy riding auto | I have rode in a 2008 Buick which looks about the same on the out side but rides good | I travel for a living and not looking forward to driving this year | Hoping I can pay to upgrade the quality of the vehicle to make it comfortable | 
 "words": Having recently leased a Cadillac CTS I expected a Chevy to be far inferior | I have driven the Impala only about 500 miles but the verdict so far is quite positive | This is a very comfortable ride with most of the same upgrades I enjoyed on the CTS dual climate control heated seats OnStar XM radio traction control Stabilitrak ABS etc | etc | for less money | As to reliability I hope that is the case three separate warranty repairs for the CTS and have my fingers crossed | So far so good | 
 "words": This is a good basic car that I now regret purchasing | Be aware that even the upgraded LT does not include ABS brakes | I didn't even think about this until I got it home | It simply did not occur to me that in 2008 a large family sedan would ship without basic safety features | GM should be ashamed of themselves for this kind of reckless penny pinching | Additional penny- pinching becomes more evident as you drive the car more | Features that most people consider standard in every car such as a folding back seat are optional in the Impala | If purchasing make sure you verify what is included down to the most basic safety and convenience features that you probably take for granted | 
 "words": See alot of happy SS buyers here | Must be a different car | Had a 2002 Impala wish we had it back | Car has been in the shop 2 times since bought | Going on second week | SUBSTANDARD BRAKES that are very front heavy | DEALER CUT BRAKE ROTORS TO FIX 200 MILES ON CAR | Open rear windows if test driving and u will find heavy earsplitting wind noise | GAS ECONOMY MUCH LOWER than listed | XM SATELITE is not FREE PRICE IS IN STICKER | Motor runs rough and motor peripherals whine upon starting when cold | Rear leg room very limited | SHOCKS substandard feel like used making for bad turning | Phantom clunk in front end | GM says nothing in writing stuck with car | Get it in writing | 
 "words": Purchased this car for business use and will drive 45000 miles in 2008 | Excellent seat and ride comfort for extended highway use | Great value for less than 25000 | Leather heated power seats | strong V-6 | remote start | tire pressure monitoring at all four corners | XM radio | five-star crash rating | Better seats and ride than my previous Honda Odyssey | Likely 27-29 mpg as along-term average | 
 "words": Have gone on 2 trips since buying in late Dec | 2007 | The longest was 1500 mile roundtrip from LR Arkansas to Panama CityFl | Gas mileage is right on the money to what the window sticker said | My only gripe is on the return trip the CD player croaked after playing about 50 CD's | And the service adviser said they often have problems with burned cd's vs bought cd's | The burned cd's can cause them to hang up and not eject | One woulda thunk in this day and technology age that burned cd's would not be a problem | So in the big scheme of things this is only minor as it is covered by the bumper to bumper warranty and a new unit is on order | 
 "words": Was looking for a car with decent fuel economy cost features and size | Cross-shopped Camry Accord Sonata and many others initially | Some have criticized OnStar but I'm not sure why | It's free for a year and then you don't have to pay a penny if you don't like it | It offers great hands free calling emergency features diagnostics and lock out service | Have used all but emergency many times | The ride is quiet and comfortable and I notice little wind noise | Many features from heated seats to dual-zone cc were standard | For the price I paid I would have ended up with a 4 cylinder import comparably equipped | Domestic quality is way up lately and deserves a look | 
 "words": The Impala is a very good value because it includes features of cars costing a lot more money | The features include power heated leather seats steering wheel mounted audio controls XM Radio On-Star directions tire pressure monitor and Dual-Zone climate controls | It has a comfortable ride handles well and gets excellent gas mileage for a car of its size and weight | The 3 | 5L motor has enough horsepower and runs on regular gas | It has a very well designed interior with comfortable seats and nicely designed controls | The braking performance is good | Prior to buying my Impala I have rented both the 3 | 9L LTZ and 3 | 5L LT models | I choose the 3 | 5L engine because of fuel economy | 
 "words": I have had a GM car or truck since 1975 | My friends point out to me that when you go back you can't complain | But this car is a new low | After 300 yes 300 miles the car basically is inoperable | The gauges don't work except check engine light no A C the message display says engine hot yet no heat | Also there is a vibration in front end | So much for the good new car feeling | After having my car 1 day the dealer says the problems with my car are very interesting | They were unable to diagnose in 1 day | My feelings are that GM's problems are very interesting | Maybe I just got that car | But this american will turn to more reliable imports for future purchases
 "words": Very comfortable car love the OnStar and the hands free telephone | Handling seems to be good | Not real impressed with the 3500 V-6 | Mileage is not what I was expecting around 26 | First heavy snow we had was 12 inch's the car never missed a beat driving through it | All in all I would buy another | 
 "words": So far so good | Lots of features | Great driving experience | Safe and reliable | very stylish | great appeal with design | good performance | Nice brakes | Attractive wheels and excellent traction with Goodyear tires | Handles well in mountain driving as well as freeway | Probably the best car I've owned in 30 years | The SS Chevy is a great value and every one likes the car who see it when I'm parking the vehicle | Lots of extras for an American revolution | Go check the car out for yourself | The vehicle sells itself | Thanks General Motors I like the car | 
 "words":  I have had this car for only a month but I must say that GM is really getting their act together | One may comment that the interior materials are not up to par with some of the imports but I feel the black leather looks great on a black SS | I was considering AccordsCamry and Altimas but felt the rumble of V8 and neck snapping torque was up my ally | This car is a joy to drive on the highway and zipping in and out of traffic | The fit and finish is up to speed and the handling is fair | It is a heavy front wheel drive car with over 300hp | I have over 2500 miles in one month and am just under 20 mpg's with mixed driving | I am in sales and will do another review as the mileage piles on | 
 "words": Every morning I go out to my car to begin the day's journey to work a situation that will put a frown on most people's faces | But as I walk up I hit the remote starter and hear the deep throaty roar of the V8 and I can't help but think this is what Chevy meant by The Heartbeat of America | Needless to say Every morning I drive to work with a smile on my face | This car has amazing power and very crisp handling living up very well to the Super-Sport lineage | The exterior and interior are both clean and sporty and look distinctive from anything else on the market | In short on paper this car was exactly what I wanted in practice this car is exactly what I wanted | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Impala and I really love what they have done with this one | The exterior is much sleeker and interior is more luxurious than before | The ride is about the same but the handling is a little better than my 03 was | I'm liking the OnStar so far and the XM is great | standard now on all models | Honda Nissan or Toyota do not offer any such thing for around 22000 which is what I paid for my LS | It has enough goodies for me to enjoy and has turned a few heads some saying they can't believe it is a Chevy | I used to buy only foreign cars but that was when Gm had some catching up to do | Thanks GM for getting this one right | 
 "words": Rented a brand-new Impala SS for a recent two-hundred mile trip | With a nice exterior styling and a roaring V8 this car could have been a huge hit for GM | However it lacks the refinement features and quality that are present in even entry-level import sedans | Despite its sport pretentions the car's steering and suspension are numbed with novacaine | Transmission lacks the auto-stick feature and is neither sporty nor refined | Wind noise is pronounced The interior lacks any character and feels generations behind both in quality and in content of my 06 Civic | The quality throughout is inconsistent | Overall the car has a feel of being designed by the bean counters for the rental lots | 
 "words": SS model equals superb fun | Just got all black SS model with chrome 18 inch wheels and the car is a looker | Performance exceeds my expectations while appearance blows the competition away | 
 "words": This car is pretty good it handles well is pretty good on gas and is quite comfortable | It | s one major drawback is what they perceive to be a marketing plus OnStar | It is unreliable an annoyance and definitely not worth the money | With so many other equally acceptable alternatives out there unfortunately for the domestic manufacturers most of them are foreign made it is a shame that we are effectively forced by GM to look elsewhere if we are to be able to get a car we really want | What really stinks is that most of the rental cars are not equipped with OnStar but the general public is not offered this same level of courtesy | 
 "words": Overall not too bad but not much of an improvement on previous version | They'd better look out because the new Ford Taurus has this one beat by a long shot | That'll be the second car for this family bye-bye GM
 "words": Had the car a couple of weeks and put 600 miles on it | It's a very comfortable car even the 3 | 5 has more than adequate power I've never felt like I had to have more | I've only used regular gas so far and gotten 28 MPG | Controls are all logical | I got the leather package and seats are comfortable but could use more side support | Great room up front but lacking a bit in rear leg room for as big as the car is | My only beef is the paint finish the hood has 2 big blotches dealer noted it and offered to repaint under warranty but something as bad as that should have never made it out of the factory | 
 "words": I've owned over 30 vehicles mostly GM some Ford but compared to Cadillac this Impala is every bit as comfortable quiet quick and nimble to boot | Cushy rides are important on long trips especially if the highway isn't smooth and comfortable | This car handles predictably and has good view all around | I had a 1984 Cadillac for 13 years and this cars ride and finish is every bit as good | The new radio is very intuitive and has excellent reception | XM AM and FM don't have to be preset separately you can mix and match up to 36 yes three dozen radio combinations | Especially useful if you have favorites or favorite areas of the nation and if you drive a lot | 
 "words": When loaded with leather heated seats retractable sun roof and a fine sound system this vehicle is nearly as good as the Hyundai Acera | The car cruises on the highway extremely well | It does not have the pep I would like but it does the job especially when fueled with E-85 | This flex fuel vehicle gets a big lift from the higher octaine gasoline that helps solve the sluggish pickup problem | I found the vehicle not as comfy as my Cadillac Deville but it was nearly as nice | The price of this vehicle is right | The 28k I saved made me feel a heck of alot better in giving up my Cadillac for the 31 mpg I now get on the freeway | Good value good on gas and nice looking to boot | 
 "words":  and let loose the dogs of war | Purchased used certified 17k still under warranty | Beautiful jewel tintcoat | Traded in my 06 Cobalt SS | Needed something a little roomier | I've never owned a 4 dr sedan so was hesitant | Didn't want a dowdy land barge | Impala SS fits the bill | Dangerously fast and powerful | I'm lovin' it | Drive 200 miles round trip to work each week and it's 50 city 50 highway 21 | 1 mpg | not bad | But it's the Raw Power it'll make you smile and then some | Go test drive one it's a life altering experience | go buy now | You'll never look back | 
 "words": My round trip daily commute to work is 120 miles | I have found the Impala to be stylish and comfortable and affordable | Would like better fuel economy | By changing brands of gasoline I have increased gas mileage from 21 to 24 25 mpg hwy | I have owned 2 Monte Carlos 2001 LS and 2006 LT and miss them both | 119000 and 88000 respectively | The Impala LTZ and SS are as close as you will come to the soon to be extinct Monte Carlos | The OnStar feature was a selling point for me and the Impala LTZ is priced right good buy | 
 "words": This is one great all around car | You can easily obtain 27 mpg on a highway trip but combined your looking at 20- 21 mpgstill not bad for a v8 | When I was purchasing this Impala I was also looking at the 08 Honda Accord 4 cyl | They were almost the same in price but a huge decrease in Insurance on the Impala SS | I couldn't believe it | I have had no problems with this car | Chevy's are great quality cars | 
 "words": When I was at the dealership trading in my Dodge ram I had in mind I need something reliable well having had my ram for only 7 months and having it in the shop 6 times had me kinda discouraged | Well I came across this impala loved it at first sight | Unfortunately the only problem I have with the car is that every other impala seems to be the same shade of light Gray | Well that being said I love everything else | The 3 | 5 liter engine is powerful | And I've gotten 36 miles per gallon on the highway and average 24 | 6 in the city which isn't bad | The trunk is huge | The interior is nicely done and the seats are the most comfortable and supportive I've ever sat in and the ride is amazing | 
 "words": The impala has made driving fun for me again | It handles very well quiet engine plenty of power and it looks great inside and out | I'm also saving money on gas these days | I was able to buy my car with extremely low mileage at a great price | I looked around and for the money you can't beat what you get with the impala | 
 "words": This is my second Impala my other was the 2003 model the 2008 is just as nice and seems quicker when you put the petal down far better gauge display then the 2003 | 
 "words":  We are very pleased with our car | A little disappointed with sticker mileage compared to actual | All manufacturers seem to get away with that one | However very reliable car runs smooth LOT'S of power | Wanted the LTZ because of more HP | Salesman said I would be happy with LT and saved a lot of money | He was right | The traction control is a must in the snow here in Canada | Never had a problem | 2nd winter with it and reg | all season tires | By the way we found that if you order a car with the features you want it can save you money on the sticker price | Can save another thousand if you order it as the dealers automatically tack on a thousand to cover cost of the car sitting on the lot | 
 "words": Handles great steering is snappy and sharp some say clunky but for a spirited driver its perfect | Combined with 4 doors and a large trunk it's sporty and versatile | Opted for the silverstone metallic with black leather sharp | Great stereo firm but comfy seats with heaters | XM and OnStar are great | 303hp doesn't hurt either | Have scared a lot of tuners on the line when the 5 | 3L makes the tires scream just remember to turn off the traction control | And it even runs on regular 87 octane | Tell that to your Charger owners | 
 "words": I've read complaints about the poor vision in the rear view mirrors | On every car I own I buy the little round blind spo mirrors at Walmart for about 2 bucks each and put them on the outside corner of each mirror | I then have excellent side mirror vision | Another complaint I've read is about poor visibility through the rear window | Especially with a spoiler | C'mon | I can see everything I need to see through my rear window | I have a spioler I haven't had the car too long but I love it | Read the consumer reviews on the higher rated Honda Accord and Toyota Camery and you'll find a much higher percent of complaints than that of Impala owners | Go figure | 
 "words": Excellent car all round driving fuel economy of 27 with 50 and town driving | Comfortable ride solid feel on the highway | Would advise anyone to test drive if looking for an American car | 
 "words": It was between the Impala and the Malibu | I picked the Impala because it was bigger and advertised mileage was almost as good | My driving is 90 highway and the best mileage I have gotten after 5000 miles is 24 | 5 but usually getting around 23 the dealer had the nerve to put a 30mpg sticker on the car | I miss my 2000 Monte Carlo SS that regularly got 27-30 mpg | Feature wise the car is good although they cheaped out on the radio sounds terrible no matter how I adjust it and I miss the auto darkening rearview mirror on my Monte | The heat ac controls are terrible every time I put my hand near it they move to small and soft to the touch | OnStar is hard to use and people can't hear me | 
 "words": Bought vehicle 11 08 | Was a rental car so a few nicks in the body but in great shape | Great car good gas mileage | Averaged about 24 mpg on only long distance trip I have taken so far | Great comfort and XM radio is a great bargain | Haven't listened to AM-FM radio yet | Smooth ride | Heated seats are a big plus | Fantastic pick up and it turns a lot of heads with I drive in to the store or church | V8 sounds tough and kicks it when you step on the gas | Couldn't be happier with the purchase | Chevy hit a homer with this one | 
 "words": Have considered this car to be one of the best purchases in the auto line that I have ever made | In varied driving mostly town local two trips I have been averaging close to 27 MPG | Trips 31 daily 24 which I believe quite remarkable for this size of car | Have had no problems at all | 
 "words": This is the second LTZ we've purchased and both have the same fuel mileage about 24 mpg highway not even close to the 28 mpg advertised and both cars have over 10000 miles on them | the rest of the car is great good design great stereo and it handles great | I wouldn't recommend this car with the 3 | 9L engine because of the poor mileage but would recommend the car with the 3 | 5L engine instead | 
 "words": I have owned Impalas for 10 years now and love them | I prefer a larger car with some room to move over compacts and this car delivers that | The car's interior is much more refined then my 2005 was | I think the luxury package is a great addition and I really appreciate the upgraded interior | The extra engine power in the latest model is nice and the car never lacks pickup when it's needed | The car handles well in town and on the highway and delivers respectable mileage especially considering the size of the car | I have had this car for 6 months and have not experienced any issues with quality or reliability | from my experience with Impala I wouldn't expect to | 
 "words": Mine is a Gov't staff car | Base model | Flawless since day one | Actually seats 6 grown men | I consistently get 29- 31mpg | Bigger than Accord or Corolla for a Chevy price | Bigger interior bigger trunk and sacrificing 4-5mpg is worth it | Surprisingly good in snow too | 
 "words": Overall I like the car but could have loved it with just a few changes | No bluetooth with OnStar | Give me a break it's on the 2009 model | Also dont like OnStar | Give me my Garmin any day | But for the money good car 
 "words": I just got this car not too long ago | I was pretty impressed at first and after the haze of a new car went away I am still pleased | The dual climate control is interesting but not a must have | I love the trunk space and the roomy interior | The computer system that displays oil life temperature tire pressure and etc | is a cool gadget | Love the remote start | The gas peddal felt a little stiff because I am used to a 4 cylinder | I like the chrome accents and so far no problems | The factory speakers are kind of weak and the drivers side leg room could be increased in the future | I tried out an 2004 Chevy Classic before I got this car and it was a huge improvement | 
 "words": While this car is not only fun to drive as well as get into a little | I really appreciate the gas mileage when the MDS kicks in and your only running on 4 cylinders | I average 28 mpg per tank and that's with a little fun thrown in | Additionally I found out that the 5 | 0 Pony car can not keep up on the top end on a good interstate | 
 "words": I now understand why GM is going bankrupt | Their cars are awful | My Chevy Impala is an embarrassment | Cheesy seats pain getting in and out of car and not scrapping the parking brake | Upside peppy with decent MPG | the downside craftsmanship design seats handeling cabin noise sound system | The people running GM owe me an apology for this lack of effort | The reason why GM performs so poorly is that they are out to make a buck not a car | The Japanese have learned make a good car and the bucks will follow | Goodbye GM and good riddance | I wish you would take back my Impala | 
 "words": It's a good car for the price | I paid 17000 out the door for a certified car | Comes with a 5 yr-100000 bumper to bumper so the warranty is really 120000 | Ride is OK great mpg | My avg is 29 | It's a good family car for the price 
 "words": This Impala is a terrific family and fun vehicle | 90 of the use is back and forth to work | Between city and highway there is a 22 | 4MPG overall | More than happy for a car this size | Took a road trip with 4 people 5 suitcases and numerous other items in the trunk and averaged 29 | 7MPG between Chicago and Columbus | Cabin space is more than adequate | Easy handling very responsive both steering and accelerating | My only concern is front end handling in the rain | The vehicle feels light and slides out easily during turns | Overall I highly reccommend looking this vehicle over when considering making a purchase | 
 "words": I did my research on the vehicle before I bought it | Gas mileage I thought was pretty good for a small block V-8 | I average about 20-21 miles gallon | Had relatively small problems out of it so far door lock and mirror switch went bad typical electrical | Handling is stiff acceleration is great | Opted for the no bose gonna switch out system for aftermarket | Pretty happy with vehicle so far
 "words": Bought an 08 Impala SS a few weeks ago really enjoying it | Nice big car comfortable ride lots of power I think it looks great | Quibble are lousy interior lighting almost impossible to read a map in the front seat at night with the small lights in the rear view mirror and odd cup holders | seats a bit flat | Easier to get into than my 06 Grand Prix GT and easier on fuel too | It's your grandad's Impala until you stuff your foot into it | 
 "words": Seems to have a steering response that is way too quick better turn the traction control off if you plan on stomping on the gas pedal and pulling into the passing lane | As well you better turn the traction control of if you see someone eyeballing you at the stoplight or they are going to leave you burning rubber | Factory tires are junk and do not handle water hydroplanes easy in the rain Is quite dangerous in fact this is a 50 mile per hour car in the rain | The steering can correct but the tail is like a boat out of the water | 
 "words": I fell in love with the looks of this vehicle and the chrome on the rearend is very beautiful which drew me to the car | I had not owned an Impala before but I am completely a Chevy girl | I come from a racing family and this car has not let me down | 0-60 in well have not timed it but I am happy | I can get the power when I need it and have not had any problems at all with the car | Would I buy it again oh you bet I would | OnStar is wonderful and I am hooked on XM | Very happy with my purchase | 
 "words": I traded in my '03 Impala with 3 | 8 liter engine for this supposedly more fuel efficient model | The old Impala got 30 mpg on the hiway and averaged around 24 | This new engine is getting 18 | 5 mpg on my commute and if babied on the hi-way will get 26 mpg | Also if you decelerate and then want to accelerate quickly there is about a 1 second hesitation before the throttle will do much | Really heart stopping in heavy rush hour traffic | Disappointed that this smaller car with an engine that shuts off half of the cylinders to save fuel turns in worse performance and way worse fuel economy than the old 3 | 8 liter engine | Also OnStar should be an option only | Why pay for it if you don't want
