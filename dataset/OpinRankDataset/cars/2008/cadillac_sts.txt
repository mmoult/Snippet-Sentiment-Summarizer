REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased two new GM vehicles in 2008 a Cadillac STS AWD and a Silverado 1500 LTZ 4WD | The quality of workmanship was the best I've ever seen in my 53 years of owning and driving all kinds of cars | 0 defects good fitment quality throughout | As good over better than any foreign car or truck I've ever been exposed to | Thinks I They've finally got it right | 
 "words": Leased my 2008 STS in late December 2007 | Failed camshaft sensor failed right side cam at 13000 miles deffective FOB's 5-burned out lights deffective driver's seat lumbar system | Dealer is great but car spends too much time in service bay | Will not lease or buy another GM product | Totaly fed up | 
 "words": Love it except the paint | The car is black and I had it waxed immediately by a professional | The first time I cleaned it myself I discovered many pock marks on the hood and rear deck | They are in the paint and wax does not remove them | I am taking it into the dealer to check | The paint is defective and I hope someone will back it up | 
 "words": I purchased mine at the end of August when there were only V6 AWD models | I traded my V8 STS and thought I would be taking a step down | With V6 DI engine I really do not miss the V8 | So far this car is solid in all respects | handles wellcomfortable reliable good mileage and is fast enough | In my opinion this car favorably competes with BMW MB and the other usual suspects but after you negotiate your final price there really is no comparison becuse you pay a lot less | The status of a label is unimportant to me although a Caddy still has some clout left and as car enthusiast I look to the raw driving experience | STS is right there and if the V8 G8 had AWD I would be driving that | 
 "words": My first Caddy | I have owned many Lincolns several Mercedes a terrific Jag and some unmentionables over my almost 40 years of business driving | This car has great styling exceptional sound system and many many options | It is very responsive quite and comfortable to drive | I drove all the others before I chose the caddy and price was not a concern | I'm glad to be driving an American sport sedan | It looks good and drive great | Time will tell but so far it's a winner | 
 "words": The car is fun to drive and is great when its not in the repair shop | I have had my STS in service 2 times in the last three months BRAND NEW for different problems | GM and Cadillac treat you like you bought a Chevy | You pay a high end price and get low end service | To sum it up they suck and I will never buy a GM product again | High end imports are more reliable and give much better customer service | 
 "words": After 2 BMWI just bought my first caddy at 36 yrs old | I was just tired seeing BMWG35NEW C-class even the new CTS every corner | So I found a great STS | It's very comfy very luxurious and the space inside | The nav with the 15 speakers from Bose | Oh la la | Its the best oem sound system I've ever heard by the way I am a musician | Of course the mileage is so so I bought the v8 | Funny that the hid light are not std for that car | Overall its a good value when reduce cause I wouldn't buy at full retail | I love everything about the car but its not BMW handling and driving experience | When you think about it who care were not formula 1 driver right | Cadillac the ultimate luxury experience | I guess
 "words": I had S-class Mercedes and BMW 7 several times before | I changed my S500 and I'm glad I did | Those fancy Germans are just not worth the money when it comes to compare | 
 "words": I bought the V8 style because adaptive speed control was not available on the V6 | I traded in my 2005 STS and got a great deal on the purchase | To this point I am very pleased with the car although gas mileage has not been good | Hopefully it will get batter as I put more miles on the car | Although my 2008 is still very newI believe it is a big improvement over the 2005 | The car looks and rides better | I believe I made a good decision in purchasing the 2008 STS | 
 "words": Since January my wife and I have driven this vehicle daily | At 250 miles we took off to Florida from Ohio and averaged 24 mpg at 68 mph | Many times I took it above 75 | The six speed transmission feels almost continuously variable | We purchased the navigation option along with the luxury interior package and AWD | I agree 18 wheels would have been nice but the HD brakes are not compatible with this larger wheel | The car performance is smooth and controllable compared to the BMW 535 and the Mercedes E Series | We test drove the CTS and agree with other reviewer that there is no comparison | Quality is unassailable and with 5500 miles ytd we would purchase all over again | 
 "words": This is my first Cadillac I love it | Everywhere I go people tell me it is a beautiful car | I love the red of this car I love all of the chrome | We took it on a 2500 mile trip two months after buying it had a wonderful drive | We did have a problem when pulling over on the highway to change drivers | A rain- filled pot-hole crumpled the front end not noticeable on the outside | A simple call to OnStar led us to the nearest dealer | The only option we did not get was the navigation system I'm fine with that | My husband had wanted a Chrysler 300 I sold him on this so far he's happy with the car me | I love that smiling front end | On the car | 
 "words": Car has been into shop twice with less than 400 miles on the odometer | Today it completely died after refusing to shift into any gear higher than second | Problems with stability control and antilock brake system at 200 miles | Also has some paint flaws that need to be addressed | I'm sorry I tried so hard to buy this vehicle | 
 "words": I test drove a CTS first | It was just Ok | I then drove the STS and Wow | I was sold | Big difference | They want to sell you a CTS at sticker b c they make more on them but the STS is worth the extra money it is much more car | Smooth quiet luxurious | This is quite simply a nicer car than the 5- series BMW and E-Class Mercedes without the price tag of the BMW or the poor quality of the Mercedes | I could not tell the difference in performance test driving the V-8 and V-6 | The DI V6 feels like a V-8 | This car simply babies you | Frustrating that you can't get AWD with all the toys in the V-6 | I opted for all the toys on a RWD with the 18 chrome wheels package Car looks awesome | 
 "words": Love the car | But difficult to get out of it | Doors seem a bit small | GPS advanced difficult to learn | Dealer should specifically have someone to spend 30 to 45 minutes with you to review | Would make life easier first few days | Overall very happy and doing better on gas after 350 miles than I expected
 "words": First off I am in full agreement with all preceding reviews | And I wonder why I haven't seen in last eight months any media promotion a commercial or even a simple ad for this sophisticated competitor to the Lexus Infiniti BMW and Benz types | Incidentally there isn't even any dedicated 2008 STS Forum on Edmunds yet | The only three minuses on the car are the lack of space inside for stuff where to put glasses | small trunk and overcomplicated nav system which is in fact inferior for instance to the 5-year older 2003 CTS system | 
 "words": I had driven a Volvo S-60 with AWD and wanted a bigger AWD car | Looked at BMW Audi Lexsus and settled on the STS with the new direct injected V-6 | Great power great tranny | Car has every bell and whistle | Love the remote start heated-cooled seats and the heated steering wheel | Car is good looking outside and very attractive inside | Great highway cruiser but also very agile and responsive in city driving | In snow or rain the AWD is superb | 
 "words": I was really excited about getting this car | I wanted the Bluetooth capability and ordered the vehicle when I discovered it was included | However the voice recognition system is quite faulty as it just does not work properly | Cadillac just installed a second nav radio to combat this problem and still it does not respond to voice commands | When a command is given it responds three times with Pardon and then says Command not recognized | Because of this I am not able to make telephone calls except when the vehicle is in park | Not at all convenient | Maybe Cadillac will fix this problem | I hope so | 
 "words": Have only owned the Caddy for a couple of weeks and I am very impressed | I looked at evrything from BMW's Acrua's other Cadillac's and even the new Buick Enclave | I live in snow country of upper Michigan and the STS afforded me the opportunity to own a classy Luxury car with AWD | Gas mileage is great compared to owning an SUV upper here | And the in-line V6 has all the get up an go that I would need | At first the Navigation system appears to offer it self to one with a degree in computers but a little hands on time is all thats needed | Cost more than the CTS but you get more and it is defintely a better auto for the extra money | 
 "words": We enjoy driving this car and both want to drive when we go | Handles fantastic and could not be quieter | The direct injected six is more powerful than my old Seville V8 has more horsepower | The mileage is better than the 2001 Seville as well | Interior finish is tops the programing features took some time to master for the memory feature | Very happy with this car and no bag of money had to go to Japan | 
 "words": I just traded in my 2003 v-8 FWD SLS for a new 2008 v-6 STS RWD | Having driven the '03 for 4 years and the '08 for only a few weeks short weeks I can say that the '08 is by far a better car | That is not to say anything bad about the '03 just that Cadillac got it right with this one | RWD IMHO is a much better way to design and build this class of car | I got the car pretty much loaded up | Sticker was 54K | The larger 18 wheels included in the 1SC Luxury Performance package along with the HD brakes really make this a driving machine | 
 "words": I like this car | However the manual reads like it was written in a language other than English | Instead of providing information the manual refers you to two other pages to get the information | The navigation system is nice but difficult to learn and again the manual is little to no help | The seats are comfortable and I like the sporty ride | The glove compartment is way too small | I do not like the fact that when opening the trunk it does not open fully | As a photographer I have arms full of equipment | I would have liked the trunk to open so I could put the equipment in the trunk instead of on the ground so I can manually open the trunk | Not a convenient feature | 
 "words": 08 has great looks and comfort | New V6 ans sheet metal improvements creates great appeal | Was looking at BMW Mercedes Audi Lexus and Infiniti for the money the STS was the best buy 
 "words": 2008 STS Just delivered and drove from East Hampton Long Island to Myrtle Beach South Carolina | Wife and kids love the ride on this car more than our former BMW 5 series | MPG combined on the car's computer stunned us with 21 | 6 combined and 27 mpg all day long on the highway running 87 octane | 
 "words": 302-horsepower engine with direct injection V6 | A bolder look on the outside and inside will attract younger buyers | I am 41 | I wanted a 4 wheel drive car that can accommodate 3 car seats in the back | I looked at the BMW 535xi Lexus GS350 AWD Infiniti M35 currently drive Infiniti M45 at Audi A6 | For the money the 2008 I stress the 2008 STS was the best value | The increased performance and the side air extractors incorporated into the front fenders of STS | New chrome-plated door handles and lower rocker moldings are added for more presence and refinement |
