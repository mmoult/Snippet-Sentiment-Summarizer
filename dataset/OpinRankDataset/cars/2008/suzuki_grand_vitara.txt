REVIEWS
 "words": We traded my wife's Rodeo for the GV she wanted something smaller | We spent 2 months researching every SUV on the market | This is a great little suv for the value | Nothing to brag about-just an ordianry suv with limited features | It's perfect for the local driving | 
 "words": I bought my GV after having a SX4 for a year | Loved that little car But I was too accustomed to a Grand Cherokee for many years | So after convincing hubby I wasn't totally crazy for trading cars even he has to admit the GV is wonderful | I mainly do city driving so yes the gas mileage isn't the greatest but not the worst either | I have taken it on a few runs to nearby states and actually got top gas mileage | And I can fit us comfortably in it and we can look good in the new SUV | I too would like lit features on the steering wheel and a rear window that opens would have been a big plus | All in all I'm very happy with the purchase | we got a great deal by buying year end | 
 "words": Being a suzuki owner for the past 6yrs I didn't hesitate to buy another | I wish I would have looked a little harder though | I got a good deal but I understand now that my monthly savings on my loan is going straight into the gas tank | Features are missing too | but I didn't miss them until I started reading the other reviews | I didn't mind that the steering wheel buttons didn't light up until I read about it and now it drives me NUTS | I love the size I can haul a lot inside and tow my camper with no problem | I would recommend to a friend but warn them that gas will kill ya | Nice to read about the KN Airfilter on the other review I'll try that | Oh whats with not having an ipod jack | 
 "words": This is the first SUV i have ever bought and so far i love it | got rid of my van and bought this i love being able to whip in to parking spaces with so much ease | Handles great on dry roads as well as in the rain | very roomy great for my family of four | the back door opening like a regular door is great for getting groceries out with the garage door shut i could not ever do that with the hatchback door on that van | great family car and i love the way it looks | 
 "words": I bought the SGV for its bring-it-on performance and it delivers | Nothing can match the looks and the 4-mode drive having AWD and low range-is awesome | The SGV is at home in the city or for light off-roading | Its handling build safety fit and finish are at a par with its closest competitors | 
 "words": Hugs the road better than any other car especially in the rainy mountains | Love the constant 4 wheel drive | Gas mileage could be better | Love the keyless entry
 "words": The ride is astounding and the features this car has in unreal | Climate control all time 4wd anti lock brakes tire pressure monitoring system and many others | There is plenty of leg room and head room and the ride is so nice and smooth | I did have the front seats altered | As someone said they were uncomfortable and it is an easy fix | In both seats are three steel rods that can be easily removed and when this is done the seats are just perfect and comfortable | I also had an upholstery man make a 3 inch pad and add it to the center console and this car is a great comfortable ride | Buy the car truck | You will not be unhappy | 
 "words": I wasn't looking at Suzuki at first to replace our 2004 Honda CRV which was totaled after a accident but after owning and driving the Vitara I am quite impressed with its performance and styling inside and out | The fwd rear mounted engine is easy to work on having low range control is great | 
 "words": Needed a tow-car for the new RV | Not a huge listing of vehicles that can be towed all 4-wheels on the ground | Looked at the Honda CR-V Saturn VUE and the Grand Vitara | Loved the idea that we could get a 4WD tow vehicle | Inspected all and by far the Suzuki gave us the most goodies for the dollars | I love the smartkey the streamlined lay-out of the dash different lighting in console auto climate control south Texas gets hot | Fun to drive very responsive | Not sure on the reliability yet | Haven't had it long enough to gauge mileage | Know it's not as good as the CR-V but it has so many more features we can certainly live with it | Looks to be a great little vehicle | 
 "words": I had originally went to dealership to look at SX-4 crossover | Liked it but wife thought we needed something a little bigger | I agreed so we decided on the GV | Great driving vehicle to commute to work great around town and on interstate easy to park and holds plenty of stuff | Put in a KN air filter and averaging around 24 mpg mixed driving | Looked at CRV RAV 4 and Escape | Went with the Suzuki and thus far no regrets | 
 "words": I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say We are impressed | I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki but this mid sized SUV has it all | Now if you are looking for V8 power buy a V8 but the 2 | 7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road | The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for | We are getting 17 19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet | I'll report on that later | Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV | Heck Just go test drive one and see for yourself | The car sold itself | 
 "words": I never imagined loving my car this much | I absolutely LOVE my car | I would never have purchased a Grand Vitara if my sister didn't work for Suzuki | I was able to get a great deal on the car | I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a small SUV | It drives great is extremely comfortable | The features are endless | I am 25 and live in O | C | anyone who drives my car says the same thing | All my friends want one the VP of my company said he was definitely going to look into Suzuki SUV's when they purchase their next car | I had never even driven a Suzuki until the day I got mine | I got it becasue of the deal never imagined loving it this much | 
 "words": I love everything about my Grand Vitara except for the lousy gas mileage | I only get 14-15 MPG in town | Other compact SUVs are far superior in this area | If gas mileage is a primary concern a Rav4 Vue or CR-V would be a better choice | 
 "words": So far this little truck has been doing a great job for my wife and I | We have taken a few road trips in it now and she performs great | The last trip it was a total of 6 passengers as well as luggage and all fit comfortable within the little truck | Great pick up on the engine smooth shifts just a pleasant drive all around | 
 "words": I was enamored with the vehicle but now that I've driven it a month in different conditions road surfaces I've feel that I overlooked a few things during the purchase phase | The seats are physically hard to get comfortable in | They're designed built for an anthropometric model of a 5'5 person | Leg room in cockpit seat is cumbersome and your legs go numb on trips lasting 3-4 hours | Controls for the stereo and cruise control on the steering wheel are also awkward to use when not looking directly at them | They're not lighted for nighttime operation | Extremely annoying | The stereo's tinny and rattles when the bass is on 0 volume on 15 | The cloth seats are minimalgo with leather | Good luck | 
 "words": We traded my wife's Murano for the GV she wanted something smaller | We spent 3 months researching every small SUV on the market | Test drive and features sold us | This is a great suv and a great value | Handeling is marvelous and the ride is solid | Could use a tad more power | Smart key took some getting used to but love it now | Everything about this little truck rocks | I want to drive it and leave my Lincoln in the garage | 
 "words": It's been a few weeks since i bought it and I already love it | As others i do have a about the Fuel economy but i can't complain since its an SUV | My first one for ever | Its nice peppy and great interiors | The fuel economy of the new car generally increases within 1-2 months of the purchase | Love the ESP Tire pressure monitoring mp3 and great interior | The head lights are similar to new Land rovers and are really bright | I also like the audio controls on the stearing which come standard | It gives me around 20-22 hwy city and 24 hwy yet but i am sure its going to improve a bit after a month |
