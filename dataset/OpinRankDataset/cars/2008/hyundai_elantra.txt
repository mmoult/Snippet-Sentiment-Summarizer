 "words": We bought this car from Hertz Car Sales for 9995tax | We researched cars for several months prior to our purchase and were leaning towards the Elantra | When we saw this price we went and drove the car | Wow | We were pleasantly surprised | It had under 25000 miles | So far we have had no problems | We love the handling and at 70 mph on the freeway it hugs the road | Loaded with extras | It has a nice sporty feel | Consider this one if you are looking for a compact | 
 "words": Over all I enjoy my car | It's great on gas smooth ride great pick uproomy I get lots of compliments | I enjoy all the featuresespecially for the price | It's not a car that's good for driving up steep hills especially in snow or icy weather conditionsit's just down right scary | I was surprised at how easily the interior gets scratched up as well as the outside paint job | I have scratches galore from other people's car doors people walking by ect | Oh yes apparently someone at the factory forgot to put a screw in my rear passenger window it came loose | The dealership fixed it at no charge | Otherwise the car is ok I'm still happy I bought it | 
 "words": The windows on my Elantra are not tinted enough and the care get extrememly hot enough to heat a meal if left on dashboard and I have a wheel cover on the steering wheel so I can touch it | I live in the south and it gets very hot | On long trips I have to keep something over my knees if it is in the summer and I have on short pants | The AC is somewhat inadequate unless run on high | Contacted Hyuandi America and they claim it is a problem for the dealership | So much for customer satisfaction | Will not purchase another one
 "words": First week of ownership 240 mi odo week stranded in 100 dregree heat as fuel pump went | Gas mileage citi hw 20-24mpg very poor and I drive conservatively | Fog lights and back-up lights provide no added vision too small | Lot's of manufacturing defects needs alignment lights pointed down steering column rubs and makes noise | Too bad as I would have bought 2 more and my neighbors also but not now after this disappointing experience | I recommend you buy Toyota or Honda both of which I've owned w o ever seeing the dealer in the warrant period and the Toyota was the first year model Tracel 1990 Now have 800 miles on vehicle and still not improvement in gas mileage | 
 "words": I just graduated high school and was looking at a lot of cars from Toyota to Mazda to Chevy | i finally found the Hyundai Elantra | Searching all over for the SE was crazy | if ur looking for an SE good luck finding one | The warranty is the best | The car is quiet and has a lot of room | the trunk is huge | the Elantra also gets very good gas i have a 136 miles already and not even a half a tank | 
 "words": I traded in my 2003 Ford Windstar that was getting around 17 miles a gallon for this car | I still like approaching it in a parking lot and still think it is pretty cute | I got a 5 speed because I had one as a kid and was going through a mid-life thing | The gas mileage is a steady 29-31 depending where I drive | I still really like it overall | My husband keeps asking me if I still like it and it has been 8 months | I am not sure when he thinks I will say no | But I hope never | 
 "words": This is the first new car I've ever bought | I was car shopping for over a year prior | I test drove Civics and Corollas in my price range for about two months and something wasn't grabbing me | As soon as I test drove the Elantra I knew that was my car | The interior is really good looking get so many compliments especially at night with the blue lights | I also love all the features esp | the XM and radio controls on the steering wheel and the drive is very smooth and secure | The car turns well and I love driving on the highway quiet good pickup | NOTE I got a spoiler and it makes it that much cuter | 
 "words": I purchased my auto Elantra Se in Feb 08 | I love the mileage I'm getting | I average 29-31 miles combined city hw driving | On the highway going at 65 I averaged 36 | 9 miles to the gallon | WOW | Its very comfortable | I've made 2 trips to MS so I have almost 13000 miles on it and still loving it | Its a great car and would recommend it | Yes some can get lemons in any make model but don't let one lemon spoil your awesome driving experience | 
 "words": I just got this car two days ago | ive been searching all over for cars and i finally settled for this one | Especially the SE you cant find it anywhere we called every dealership to see if they had one and finnaly found one | The Elantra SE has a lot of room and different compartments | its very comfortable | The car also picks up speed good | 
 "words": I really do enjoy this vehicle | All around good buy | Transitioned from a Crown Victoria to the Elantra due to obvious fuel economy issues and am extremely satisfied | The safety features Halo airbags stability control are standard an a great addition | 
 "words": I first posted a review in April | I had the car for one month and liked it | Now after taking three trips and putting on 5100 miles in three months I can not describe how awesome this car is | On the trips I avg 35 mpg mostly hwy | Normal everyday mixed driving avg has been 30 mpg's | Driving for long periods have been comfortable and enjoyable | During heavy rain the stability control worked well | The heated seats warmed up quick the stereo XM have great a sound | The Electric Steering make parallel parking easy | One slight thing I noticed is the air conditioning seems a bit weak compared to my previous Elantra's not bad but did notice a change may be due to the cabin being larger | 
 "words": June 12 2008Admittedly when I went to another county to visit Atlantic Hyundai with gas priced the way it is I was looking for an economy car to help me beat whatever is ailing us today | A lower payment and better terms were my objective however crass and vehicle ignorance this may appear to suggest | What I found was a most welcomed and impressive sales organization and in the case of the vehicle I brought home | the 2008 Hyundai Elantra GLS with the power package intact the most outstanding vehicle I have personally owned and I was born when Harry Truman was a feisty show me President | The Elantra feels the road has astounding pickup and get go and more | I also saved | -Jay Adler
 "words": I must admit I wasn't at all excited about getting this car | I had to lower my payments quickly due to some financial changes | I looked at the Mazda 3 the Honda Civic | I just couldn't get a better price for the features that I got | My car is loaded with everything including leather | I'm very impressed with the fuel economy I already have over 6k miles on my car | Rear seat passengers are always impressed with the leg room that a car this small offers | I am very happy with my decision and recommend this car to anyone in the market for an upscale economy car | it can't be beat for the price | 
 "words": I love my car | Most bang for your buck | I shopped around quite a bit before buying | I really had to think of my priorities especially with a mortgage resetting in 2 year | Even without a mortgage budget I'd still pick either this car or the Sonata | I love the standard features | My bf was really pushing me towards Toyota or Honda until I showed him the price breakdowns including taxes license and interest expense | It adds up | Also I was able to get the dealer financing promo of 1 | 9 for four years | I love the blue control lights | 
 "words": We bought our Elantra two weeks ago and have really enjoyed it very much | We were basically looking for a gas efficient vehicle that made better mileage than our PT Cruiser | We must say that it certainly does that and then some with 28 mpg in the city and over 35 mpg on the highway | And that is with the air conditioner going all the time | Our mileage has almost doubled from our Cruiser and you can't beat the 5 year 60000 mile bumper-to- bumper warranty | You don't get that with Honda Toyota GM or Ford | The relatively low cost of the car was a big factor also | We looked at how much everything cost and how much gas savings we would realize | We are very happy with the overall features | 
 "words": I've only had this car for a few days now but I've been a long time Hyundai Elantra owner | Coming of a 2004 Elantra I am very pleased with the upgrades to the current model | The ride is a lot quieter than it's predecessor and the interior design is definitely desirable | I am 6'2 215lbs and I fit very comfortably in the driver's seat | The upgrades stereo with XM and and AUX input makes this car a great boom box on wheels | Gas mileage is key with the rising prices at the pump and I am seeing 28-29 mpg in and around town | 
 "words": I have the PZEV SE w Premium Package Sunroof and Heated Seats in Blue | The car was pretty difficult to find there were only about 12 in the entire state of California | I personally think the exterior is quite stylish much better than the civic or pre-2009 corolla models | Main gripes are that acceleration in PZEV is a bit poor 132hp instead of 138 and that gas mileage is not as good as corolla or civic I get about 30 mpg highway 22 or so city | Still amazing value for money | I purchased for 16 | 8K all in including California Taxes Title Registration which are about 1600 | I think and hope that this is pretty competitive deal considering the sunroof and heated seats | 
 "words": The rebate caught my attention I wanted to upgrade from my 2001 Hyundai Accent and this was a perfect find | I love the exterior black and the two-tone interior | Excellent features for a ridiculously low price sunroof cruise control XM radio fog lights | It it very spacious and driving it feels so comfortable | Wishing for lumbar support though | You can't beat the warranty and the extra features and the gas mileage and the sleekness and the value | and I could go on | I've driven 350 miles since I bought it and I haven't filled the gas tank yet | 
 "words": I was in the market for a small to mid-size car that gets good gas mileage | After driving the Civic the Corolla and the Mazda 3 I bought the new Elantra SE | It had more torque read get up and go | more room and was more comfortable than either the Civic or Corolla and was thousands less than a Mazda 3 with the same equipment | It's quiet and comfortable with lots of storage space | 
 "words": At 814 miles 17th day of ownership the fuel pump went out and left me stranded | Hyundai's roadside said they would tow me to closest dealership and leave me there even though it was closed and would be for the next 2 days | On 21st day of ownership the drivers rear window wouldn't work and had to be repaired | The car didn't even have tags yet and is already falling apart | This particular car is a lemon and neither the manufacturer or dealership wants the responsibility for it so as of now I'm stuck with an unreliable poor quality vehicle still searching for some help | 
 "words": I like the handling of the vehicle seems it will hug the road | Braking is VERY responsive afraid to sneeze because it will stop on a dime | Sound system is nice XM is a plus prefer Sirius | Recommend to anyone | Watch for rebates and incentives | I paid 1500 less than most in my area | Spacious vehicle even with an infant car seat in rear | 27 mpg on mixed country roads city or highway unknown at this time | 
 "words": I just bought his car yesterday and I am really excited about the purchase | I did a lot of research and after considering used and other makes I settled on the Consumer Reports 1 small sedan | Car looks great ie it looks expensive and is a big small sedan | Drives great and the power package is a great value | I'm graduating from college on Monday and this car looks young but not too young like a Fit or Versa so I'll be able to feel like a grown up in it Purchase price was 14200 TTL | I considered the college grad program 13500 | 8 | 9 apr 60 months no money down 45 days to first payment etc | but I got a lower apr through a bank | Shop around for best financing | 
 "words": Buzzy stereo speakers horrible gas mileage tested carefully at only 22 mpg not the 33 mpg HWY as advertised | Very noisy engine when accelerating at 2500 RPM or above excessive road noise over small bumps | Great interior looks features love the Blue dash lights | Need rear view auto- dimmer glass | 
 "words": This is a fine car for the money | Design in and out | Long list of safety features and warranty | Great gas mileage | Good build quality | Good pick up too | Auto shifter is smooth | Suprisingly roomy interior | Some road noise is pronounced on rough road surfaces | AM side of radio goes crazy under high power lines | Dealer said can't do anything | 
 "words": My mom just bought this car for me and I love it | I've been driving for years and after awhile driving gets annoying | But since I've had my Elantra I've even driven just to the mailbox down the street | Sounds crazy I know but I'll find any reason just to get in my car and go for a ride | It rides a lot smoother than I thought it would and I love the dash design and the blue backlights especially at night | Unlike other economy cars the Elantra looks far from cheap and looks just as good parked next to an Accord etc | 
 "words": First noticed this gem as the top car in it's class as reviewed by Consumer Reports for 2008 | I tested the usual crew Corolla Civic Mazda3 | All were real nice | When I tested the SE I was impressed | I made a good deal and got the rebate on top of it | Had to wait two weeks for an SE in Carbon Grey with the heated seats sunroof but it worth it | I actually got a compliment on it's color | First time in 30 years anyone even noticed the color of my car | Almost too zippy at freeway speeds | It's got the power when you need it | Yes the engine is a little noisy when pushed | I like to think it sounds sporty | 
 "words": I am 6'6 350 pounds and have been looking for a small car that I fit in for quite some time | I have found it with the Elantra | I have a 2004 Town Car and a 2007 Tundra which have plenty of room but not that great mileage for an everyday driver | I can actually exit the Elantra easier than I can the Lincoln as it has more head room | The interior is a little narrower and the leg room a little less but I am larger than most and I figure I have to give up something for that 34 mpg | The car is very impressive | The mileage on a trip was 34 | 5 and in all town driving in the 29 range | The acceleration is good and plenty of power for the MO hills | I would recommend the SE to anyone | 
 "words": Researched Toyota former car an 08 Corolla LE Honda Civic and Hyundai Elantra Se on the web and Consumer Reports | Bought the Elantra Se and am so in love with this car something I could not say about my 08 Corolla | The latter was a nice car but nothing about it said luxury | It was totaled by another driver this month Am so glad I made the switch | Safety features were primary to me after the accident my Corolla was in that nearly killed 3 people | The 4 disc brakes plus Electronic Stability Control and side and curtain air bags sold me | I had wanted them on the Corolla but they were not available unless I went to another much more expensive model Toyota | Am blown away by this car | 
 "words": Lots of leg room and comfy seats | My passengers enjoyed riding in my Elantra and said it is pretty | It's sporty and has all the bells and whistles I wanted | I'm not sure if I'm getting good gas mileage because I'm still learning when to shift between the D and D3 gears | Otherwise it's a smooth ride and strangers give me compliments on it all the time | The headlights are nice and bright the mirrors get good visibility and the blue lighted dashboard is a great feature | The trunk opener on the remote is a good thing to have also | I feel like a queen when I drive it | 
 "words": Great car has lots of upgrades that alot of other cars don't have or other dealerships want to charge you for | Has enough power and picks up and goes | My two kids fit great in the back with lots of room for legs and backpacks | I'd recommend the car | Great on gas and handles well | 
 "words": Didn't have to do much research on the Hyundai vehicle b c this is my 3rd Hyundai in 6 years | Due to the rise in gas I was determined to get a car with an overall gas mileage in the 30's | Narrowed my choices to the Elantra the Corolla and the Honda Fit | The Fit seemed like a cute car decent enough ride but not good enough for the amount of driving that I do | I couldn't tell any difference btwn the Corrolla and the Elantra as far as the overall drive and quality | However I got the Elantra for 3000 dollars cheaper | The car drives very good am surprised at the power and the cruising speeds | My wife drove it and I was constantly telling her to slow down | 
 "words": Excellent car for the price | First time buying a foreign car and very pleased | May buy another in the future | 
 "words": Just bought this car in April | love it | Great price style and comfort what better car to buy for your money | I think everyone should own one | 
 "words": Edmunds and Consumer Reports cover all the great things about this car | We test drove late model Corollas Civics etc | -rebates on the Hyundais were too enticing | Though I liked the Sonata's ride I found the smaller Elantra handled better yet still felt roomy | It's well-appointed with touches that feel like a much more expensive car including the premium audio w XM | I like the solid sporty feel of the Civic but as I've gotten older I appreciate the higher entry position and comfortable ride of the Elantra more like American sedans | The SE handled and rode noticably better than the GLS and the better fuel economy was a major deciding factor over the Sonata even with the smaller rebate | 
 "words": I wanted an SE but Hyundai did not seem to have any | Went with the GLS and have not been disappointed | Have driven in the desperate rush hour traffic here in North Texas and was well pleased with the car's handling | On the road car did quite well passing ok wind noise ok gas mileage both city and country very good | Quality of assembly superb | Like the XM Radio | 
 "words": Have only had a little over a week | Love the way it drives and looks | Paid 14990 with sunroof package | Only complaint is the alarm system goes off for no reason quite often | Brought to dealership was told it's fixed but when we arrived to pick up the car alarm was going off in parking lot | Made another appt to bring back | Had to have the brakes looked at as it was vibrating when braking | This they easily fixed by shaving the rust that had built up sitting on lot | Brakes are fine now | Warranty is outstanding | Looking to sell my SUV get another one | 
 "words": This title is an apt description of the Elantra I purchased in the middle of April 2008 | It looks even better in person as I discovered at the dealership | I owned a 2002 Sonata GLS with the V6 but the test drive with this Elantra sold me | The carbon gray color looks excellent on this vehicle and it has subtle yet classy pinstriping on the sides | There are trim moldings on the doors and wheel wells which give it a finished appearance | Above all it is comfortable to drive with plenty of head room | The trunk with cargo net is spacious and useful | The ride on the open road is quiet and smooth | The 4 cylinder performs well | Quite nimble | Loaded with great features even XM radio
 "words": Everything I wanted on a car came as standard features on the SE model | All four wheels have ABS disk brakes | The electronic stability control and side air bags make this one of the safest compacts | The ride is smooth and quiet and the design makes it look like a more expensive car | My neighbor asked if I paid over 30000 | 
 "words": I just bought this car 2 days ago | I absolutely love it | I traded a 05 Ford Freestar because of gas prices and wanted something smaller | This car has everything I have wanted in a vehicle | I have 3 kids and they actually fit comfortably in the back seat | Before I bought this car I test drove an 07 Pontiac G6 and an 07 Chevy Malibu both were nice but neither compare to the Elantra | When I test drove this car I fell in love with it | It is easy and fun to drive | 
 "words": This is a great car | Fuel economy is as advertised | It's a lot more sporty than advertised too | It has a huge trunk and both my kids carseats fit in very well | The blue lighting is great at night | The manual shift is very easy | I climb over the Blue Ridge mountain to and from work everyday and this car makes it up and down with no problems | I pass by the Yaris and Versa and laugh | This car is nice | 
 "words": There are a lot of features that are standard here example ABS that are extra on similar cars like the Toyota Corolla | It's got great safety features 6 airbags | The interior is roomy and comfortable | The dash instrumentation is nice | Acceleration while not great is good enough | It's got XM radio free for 3 months | 
 "words": This is my third Elantra and it is by far the best | It is loaded with features and it has been turning heads wherever I go | That's pretty cool when you turn heads in a car that cost less than 20K | The only option I did not get was leather but the cloth seats warm up quickly on these cool northeast mornings | Next week I am taking it on a trip and I can't wait to see how comfortable it is on the long trip | 
 "words": Still new I am really enjoying this car | It feels more expensive than it is | We were looking to stay small and cheap so we looked at Accent Yaris Rio etc | and then found out this car was not much more in price but much better for the money | 
 "words": Make no mistake this is not a 32000 dollar car though Quality for cost is superb | Between 16000 and 18000 you will not find a better quality means of transportation | The Elantra is fun to drive with a great popular package features | The warranty on the car matches and or beats other motor companies | Surprisingly roomy interior I am 6'2 and sit comfortable inside the vehicle | Fuel mileage is at 35 mpg with 65 highway driving | Exterior to interior noise control is that of a 26000 to 32000 dollar sedan | Purchasing this vehicle was not on the spur of the moment Four months of going to one dealer to the next | Finally the right car for our family at the right price | 
 "words": My initial criteria for buying a new car was it had to have fuel efficiency of at least 35 MPG have 4 doors and be comfortable for me to drive | I narrowed my search to 3 vehicles 3 different manufacturers | Surprisingly the Elantra wasn't one of them but I decided to look at it after ruling out the Accent only because of comfortability | I'm not disappointed and very happy that I did indeed look at and test drive the Elantra | What a great car for a great price | 
 "words": The Elantra is a nice car with a great interior and decent performance | I was surprised to find out the engine uses a timing belt whereas the competition from Toyota Honda Mazda gm ford chrysler have graduated to timing chains that never require replacement | Worse than that the engine is a interference design meaning that if the timing belt ever breaks the valves will crash into the pistons and destroy the engine | Interference designed engines were phased out by most manufacturers in the 1990's | A broken belt leading to engine destruction is a gamble that we dont have to take in 2008 | 
 "words": After reading numerous reviews of this car I thought I'd give it a look | I had just driven a fit when I walked next door to the Hyundai dealer and drove the elantra | I was very impressed | Feature content was unmatched very comfortable I am 62 and visibility is excellent | Power is ok and mpg's are excellent | The most pleasant surprise to me was at 80 mph on the interstate it is really quiet | Nice build quality | 
 "words": I saw the car and for 14305 I thought about it before buying | I looked at the Lancer Civic Corolla Sentra Spectra Focus Cobalt VW Rabbit and the Mini Cooper | The Hyundai just seemed to be the best deal on a new car | I took it on a long test drive and determined I had found the right one | Two days afterwards I knew I had made a mistake | The seat doesn't line up with the pedals the pedals are lined up terribly and the seat is terribly uncomfortable | The pedals themselves are lined up terribly with a gas pedal close to the seat and the clutch having a long throw | Excellent value in a car unless you are over six feet tall | 
 "words": Checked on-line for gas mileage and reliabilty and of course I had my choices from Hyundai's Honda's Kia's Toyota's and Saturns | I checked them all out and test drove a couple of them until I test drove the Hyundai Elantra | I had large vehicle that I was trading in and was used to a lot of room and the Elantra was not lacking any compared to the others | I did not feel cramped like some of the other cars I was in and felt very comfortable and secure | Absolutely a great choice for anyone | 
 "words": I've driven the Elantra SE Auto 500 miles since purchase two weeks ago | Steering on my unit is responsive and well-balanced yet several units I test-drove had what felt like over-responsiveness to steering wheel movement | City ride is comfortable | minor bumps feel like minor bumps | Highway ride is comfortable too | easy to hit 70mph without feeling any loss of control | No difference in performance between wet and dry roads | Acceleration is adequate for ordinary highway merge but is definitely geared towards fuel economy rather than fun | However I did need to gun it once and boy did it respond | Braking is smooth although I have not needed to stop short | Avg | 29 | 9mpg in 50 50 | 
 "words": To be completely honest this was NOT the car I wanted | I wanted the new Scion XB | The price was the decider here and had to stay in budget | The car gives so much value for the money | My husband has a 2005 and while neither car has a lot going on in the power department it is definitely better than anything in its price range as far as features goes | I was less than thrilled to drive it off the lot but as time goes by I am really starting to appreciate the car | It turns heads at times which is a surprise and the biggest comment I get is THATS A HYUNDAI | The interior is very stylish and does not feel cheap | We looked for over a year and drove everything out there before we bought
 "words": Traded large car on this car because of fuel prices and no longer needing a large car Buick | Looked at other makes of this size car | This one was the best for the money and has a lot of new features found on cars costing much more | My wife loves it | Drives nice and looks good | Gas mileage on the road is OK | In town driving gas mileage is great | Has a lot of pep and can go in traffic great | Nice car for the money | 
 "words": This was to replace my wife's 3 | 4 V6 Alero | We looked around for the last 6 months chose the Elantra | Civics are far too expensive even taking in to account their high residuals | We chose the Elantra SE over the GLS with preferred package as for around 1000 in our case we got the tremendous Stability Control which Consumer Reports magazine say is the most significant safety feature on cars since the seat belt | See Hyundai web site for details of this other SE features | The room inside is amazing the ergonomics are superb | Little things like doors opening a full 90 degrees to make entry exit easier | A great little car | Try it be amazed | Go for the SE though | 
 "words": I am incredibly happy with my purchase | I had test driven the '09 Corolla Dodge Caliber Mitsubishi Lancer Kia Spectra etc | The only car that I liked more was the '09 Corolla the '08 is horrendous to me as it handled better and was a more comfortable ride | However the Elantra offers many of the exact same features and includes a warranty that on the Corolla you have to purchase in addition to your vehicle to even come close | The Elantra does lack power on uphill climbs but it cruises everywhere else | I'm getting about 33-35mpg mainly highway about 28-29 city since buying it have filled up twice | After the special financing bought the car for 10K LESS than the Corolla | 
 "words": One thing that is overlooked is that the Hyundai actually has a stiffer frame than Toyota or Honda and you can feel it | The quality is just there | Absolutely superb | Very smooth on freeway tight suspension rides nice although it's body roll in corners could be less | It's been said before that it looks like a baby Lexus or something and in my silver color with tinted windows it does | I actually get a few looks | Rims are sharp looking | Absolutely perfect size car | Far from big easy to drive yet amazing interior room | Transmission is a little on the grandma end of the performance scale but shifts and transitions smoothly | Trunk has releases to fold rear seats right near the trunk opening | 
 "words": Just bought this car yesterday after test driving many other cars | IE Civic Fit Suzukis' Sebring | Traded my 2005 Tuscon | Needed a car with much better gas mileage | Since I am now driving 58 miles one way to my job | Went with a Hyundai because of there great warranty | I think many people under rate Hyundai's | I truely love mine | 
 "words": I bought this car after test driving multiple Toyota Corollas and a couple Honda Civics | The Hyundai is typically a couple grand cheaper and you get more bang for the buck | The gas mileage is decent but not great I think Toyota and Honda may have this car beat | I average about 23-24 MPG with mixed city and highway driving though I do drive fast on the highway | The car is very comfortable and roomy | It feels like a midsize rather than a compact | The interior is very classy | The Elantra simply looks a lot better on the inside than the Corolla which looked cheap and out of date | There is plenty of room in the backseat for passengers and the trunk is a good size | Overall ride is smooth | 
 "words": Transmission seems odd at first but it 'learns' your habits and adjusts | Got better every day for 1st week | Much smoother transitions now | Feels like I'm sitting still at 70mph | first tank of gas 33mpg almost all highway | Handles very well corners very well | Does not 'float' like a chevy you feel the road and get responsive handling | It even looks feels stylish inside | 
 "words": I've spent over a year looking to buy a new car | I needed something reliable safe and economical | This car has it all in spades | It's unheard of to have stability control in a car at this price | And it's a blast to drive | It has WAY more torque than the civic so it really moves when you hit the gas | Feels like it has way more horsepower too | And it steers with a perfect mix of feedback and ease |
