REVIEWS
 "words": Fine car except when I first got this | It created a problem that took the dealership 3 days of back and forth to the shop to resolved and wouldn't have been taken care of had I not had the common sense to mention and insist on the shop mech thoroughly check all components | specially the battery eventually they did at my behest and replaced the bad battery | So far as the vehicle is concerned it's awesome | The 297 est | horsepower is more than enough to carry the car around even at higher level driving fully loaded | Had the car since Oct 2008 to present with the exception of limited backseat leg space I cannot complain | I regret the fact that I opted out on the lane departure option | 
 "words": I bought this car in June with high expectations | I have been sorely disappointed | Most recently with 1800 miles on the car the battery died | The seat warmers also did not work | When they were fixed the heat was so low that I could often not even tell the warmers were on | The storage space is really limited and the gas mileage is worse than expected | Infiniti is also a pain to deal with even as my car was in the shop with problems Infiniti was more focused on selling me another car than solving my issues | What I like is the styling engine power and cool features like the rear facing camera | But I really had much higher expectations for this car | Not recommended | 
 "words": I have owned the EX35 for 18 months | It has 12k miles on it | Have had no significant service issues with the car | I like the overall driving experience of the car | Handles like a sports sedan vs an SUV | Looks are subjective but it has grown on me | The car has developed annoying interior squeaks and rattles dealer cannot locate them | The car gets HORRIBLE mileage like avg of 16 | 5 | I've never cracked 20 mpg in 18 months | With the cost of premium fuel this is a serious deficiency of the car IMHO | It's NOT due to my driving style | Had I known of this mileage issue I would not have purchased the EX35 | Sorry Infiniti I like it I don't love it | 
 "words": I love the way the EX looks | It is probably one of the best looking vehicles in the entry luxury segment | And with the comparative rarity you are in the unique position of people staring admiringly at what is essentially a short sporty station wagon | Toyota Lexus and Honda Acura have nothing on this car from the looks department | I love the car's split personality | When driven sedately its like a luxo-crusier | High seating position fine appointments quiet ride and good stereo is made for eating thousands of miles in comfort | But when you decide to gun it the V6 comes alive and pushes you to the back of your seat | And with the excellent handling it's hard not to want to drive fast | 
 "words": It is so luxurious | I love my new crossover | Thanks to the bad economy -I was able to get almost everything prem nav and lux style package for 11K under MSRP | I wanted the G37 but had to go for EX35 -It was a better deal | I have no regrets | I only had it three weeks and so far everything is great | I did take it back to have the roof rails replaced the paint was scraped but even that experience was great | The service department was nice and I had no problem waiting for my car | 
 "words": Everyone I am a car buff | I research cars for months before I buy one | I always buy new cars that are from an awesome manufacturers | I test drive dozens of cars before I buy | I have to say that I love love love this car | It is very nice inside | It looks like a Lexus and feels likes a BMW | No joke | The quality is outstanding | The engine rev is awesome | I really like all the technology that this car has with it | The safety is number one in my book | Star ratings of 5 and 4 is very good | I like the look style functionality and ease of use for everything | The dual climate control is a must | The NAV and cameras are also awesome | I am very well pleased | 
 "words": I just bought my EX35 a few hours ago after spending 3 weeks test driving EVERY comparably-priced luxury cross-over Volvo XC60 Audi Q5 BMW X3 Acura RDX | I also test drove the Honda CR-V for the practical side of me looking to save a bundle | All in all I know I may not have the most seasoned review but I can say that I do not have buyer's remorse in the slightest | I came out of a '01 Toyota Rav4 very dependable and practical for my needs at the time so the EX35 was a steal besides my car was a total loss after a wreck and I needed new wheels | I walked in test drove an EX35 and loved the smooth ride and quiet interior almost immediately | The huge savings sweetened the deal | 
 "words": What a great hatchback wagon crossover | not sure what to call it | I came from a G35 into this new machine | What a difference | The amenities and features of this car are great | Performance is great when you need it to go it hauls | Brakes are great as well | It's my daily commuter 80 miles RT about 65 hwy 75-85mph and the rest backroad driving at 45-60mph getting 22 | 5 mpg | For the amount of performance and my semi-hard driving style this is a definite upgrade from my 06 G | Back seat space is not as terrible as you think drove from NJ to Boston with 3 adults and comfort was not an issue | Great fold down feature for seats my dog LOVES this car as much as I do | I would recommend to anyone | 
 "words": I made the jump from the Infiniti G35 coupe to the EX35 and as some others have said the performance and fun-to-drive factors are the same but now I've got a backseat and a trunk | The backseat is a little small for passengers but the front seating area is roomy I'm 6 ft | 2 | The technology features like the push button fold down of rear seats and push button start are enjoyable | Wind noise is a little loud both with the sunroof open or driver passenger windows down | All in all I'm happy I purchased this vehicle | 
 "words": I've had it for a year now and still love it as much as I did when I drove it off the lot | I especially love the interior design and dash layout | It is very classy and well organized | The performance is also pretty amazing | Stepping down hard on the gas makes me forget I am in a crossover | The dealer is great and has always been very detail-oriented when appeasing their customers | I definitely recommend it if cargo space is not your highest priority but you don't want to restricted to a smaller sedan | 
 "words": Intended to buy a G37 but couldn't resist taking the EX35 out for a spin | What a great vehicle | Outstanding driving dynamics with the additional utility of back seats that fold down for a good amount of luggage space | The interior is truly beautiful and all the many features are intuitive and easy to use | True the back seat is small and not ideal for full size adults | But we are empty nesters so this vehicle hits the mark for us | It was a difficult choice to make between the G and the EX but ultimately the versatility of the EX and the incentives offered by Infiniti tipped the scales | After 2 weeks of ownership I am really pleased with the decision | 
 "words": I have a lot of reviews on the EX35 and some people just don't like this car but we love driving our EX | It is a perfect size for us | I know some people say the rear leg room is tight but we rarely have people in the back seat | The cargo room is ok | The interior flow perfectly | We were looking at the Lexus RX and think the EX interior has everything in the right place | The materials are of great quality as well | The power the car delivers is pretty good | We own a 2006 G35 coupe as well and EX does as good a job as the coupe on the highway | DS mode makes it even more fun | The tech features on this car are great | Bluetooth works perfect every time | All systems work well together | 
 "words": Yuppies will love this car | After the kids get out of college and mom and dad want to start having some fun the parents ought to definitely check out the EX 35 | My daughter was following me in another car and made the remark Geez mom you took off at the lights | Yes I sure did and will continue to do so | I have owned all makes and models of cars and never had the great time I'm having driving the EX | This car looks great handles fantastically and is my very favorite hands down | If you want to have hours of driving pleasure please buy this car | It's your turn now | 
 "words": I would not consider the EX35 as a crossover but a small station wagon rocket | It's so much fun to drive however there's a few things I would have like to see less wind noise more back seat room easier control it takes you a week to figure out how everything works | Get rid of the LDW lane change warning that you have to switch off each time you start the car | I would also work on quality and get rid of rattles in dash add foldable mirrors and change some of the plastics that looks cheap | The seats are a little short and could be more comfortable | I wish that the camera would work not only in reverse | 
 "words": Bought it new in 12 08 | it's great for wife and I since kids are long gone | We have the back seats down all the time to get enough room for the trips to Costco | The hill in front of our NJ house was awful this winter | snow snow ice ice and more snow | The EX was terrific getting us up the hill to Panera's for breakfast | List price was 40 | 8K bought it for 30 | 5K with no Infiniti financing | 10 | 3K off the list | Bernie at Ramsey Infiniti was a good guy to work with | So far the MPG is around 19 | not bad not great | We bought the black exterior with the brown interior | good choice | Our family has owned 10 Infinitis from the old slow auto G20's to the new EX | 4 yr 60K warranty is great | 
 "words": I have been watching this car since it came out last year and test drove one | I really thought it was a little too cramped and too much money I drove an SUV | Anyhow my boyfriend kept telling me to try it again when the price came way down so I asked my dealership if I could take the car for 24 hours and they let me | I was sold after that | I just love it | I drove everything from the Lexus RX BMW 328 wagon Outback Impreza Acura RDX Acura TSX Toyota Venza nice car but too big for my needs Mitsubishi Eclipse | I might have chosen the Outback but I hate the exterior look and I HATE the red lights | 
 "words": Beautiful crossover lots of power | mileage reasonable strong engine smooth 5 speed automatic transmission | The 2008 Infiniti EX35 is the first car I have ever driven that is great on gas lots of passing power and strong torque | Love it | Car is worth owning | 
 "words": Been driving an X5 for over 7 yrs and now the kids are grown and no more carpool I needed to downsize | This car is a little spitfire | I can cruise on the freeway and pass quickly | Gotta be careful | It's quite a bit smaller than what I am used to driving but yeah it took me the ride home from the dealer to accept it | Great car rides like buttah and tons of fun | Just the back seat is small | Not horribly small but not for a long drive with adults | I plan on getting another EX when this lease is up | They can't improve too much on this baby | I'm having waaaaaay too much fun | 
 "words": Been driving it since September | Love the horsepower-great passing ability | Had a mildewy odor problem with the cabin air filter | Took it to the dealer and they sprayed it but it still comes back occasionally | Overall fun to drive | Only get 15-16 mpg highway street combined but that's okay given the power and no I did not have a lead foot | AWD is awesome in the rain | 
 "words": We bought our EX about a month ago and all I can say is wow | There is nothing disappointing about this vehicle | It is the most comfortable quiet fun to drive vehicle I've owned | Great power in the engine there when you need it and also when you just want to have fun | Super stereo sound love the gadgets not difficult to figure out and use | Love the voice system and nav | Gas mileage is much better than we thought avg seems to be 25 mpg which is better than advertised | If you want a fun small suv oh and it works great in snow and ice this is a great choice | 
 "words": I used to drive a Lexus IS 300 and was looking to purchase another similar car | Naturally I was looking at the usual suspects BMW 3-series Acura TL Lexus IS 350 | I felt the BMW was overpriced for what I was getting | The new TLs exterior was too overwhelming for me I'm a petite female | I loved my Lexus IS 300 and truly believe in Lexus as a quality car manufacturer with unbeatable service but I wanted to try something with a little more edge | I found the perfect balance in the EX | I get a nice drive like a BMW with all the bells and whistles like a Lexus with a unique exterior | It's my favorite car so far | 
 "words": I own this for over one month now and love the every ride in it | The car is fun to drive interior is very luxurious and very good looking suv | you get lots of head turns | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle in Sep 08 and I am loving it | Everything is great except rear seat and rear legroom not comfortable for 3 adults | 
 "words": I had to do some hard selling to talk my wife out of her Toyota Solara Convertible and into a SUV but luckily we had an ice storm the day after we picked it up and she absolutely loves the AWD | I have an FX-45 and this car has it beat in spades when it comes to features and interior luxury | True my FX is 5 model years old but the EX is a truly great car for the bucks | Rides like a luxury car handles like a sports car | Just what Infiniti was aiming for | We're empty nesters so the lack of back seat leg room is not a problem | If we need to haul friends we take the FX | 
 "words": I bought this car after comparing with BMW X3 and Acura RDX and I believe I made a wise decision | Although both cars did have more space EX35 is much more appealing to look at and more fun to drive | This car handles and accelerates like a sports car while ride quality matches that of typical luxury sedan and braking power is very strong | I really can't complain about this car beside its lack of space in the back which drives my wife nuts every time since she has to sit in the back with my 2 year old daughter | But I do believe once she gets old enough to be out of her car seat my wife will stop complaining | I can only barely fit 2 golf bags in the trunk | 
 "words": I have reported to Infiniti a problem with making right turns | There is a grinding sound every time I turn right | I have taken to dealer twice and they don't have any solutions | They reported to Infiniti who has done nothing | I reported to Infiniti who has done nothing | Don't buy this car | I have only had the car two months | Wouldn't buy again | 
 "words": I finally convinced my reluctant wife to trade her 2005 Solara convertible for the EX35 | I have an FX45 and tried to convince her that AWD was of more value than a convertible on which we have had the top down 3 time in the last year | Well the day after we picked it up we had an ice storm and now she is a believer | She loves the car and so do I | I'm trying to convince her to let me have the EX and she can drive my FX | So far no luck | 
 "words": I've had the EX45 for about 5 weeks and I love it | I have very few complaints | The car drives like more like a sports car than an SUV the gas mileage is not bad | Cargo room is exactly what I need and though there are complaints about the space in the back seat I had 2 rugby playing friends in the back seat and they said the room was fine | I do think it would be tough to get 3 people in the back seat | Storage is not bad and it what I expected | I saw that the service intervals are 3750K miles but my driving habits are more like the alternate schedule so I plan on getting an oil change every 500K miles 
 "words": I bought this car after coming back from Iraq | I test drove the g35x but I liked the ex better | I have almost 12000 miles in the last 4 months | The car is quiet and has great acceleration | I have been pulled over more times for speeding by the police than I have in the last 10 years | The brakes are the best I have ever had in a car | 
 "words": After researching for over a year I finally chose the premium pkg awd in Canada | To my surprise the door seals on all the doors came off the doors within an hour and I later found that two cups of coffee do not fit in the cup holders | Who would manufacture a vehicle like that | Needless to say I am disappointed in this 'luxury' vehicle | 
 "words": My wife needed to replace her 4 year old BMW 3-series convertible | Some reliability issues and serious aquaplaning in Florida's wet summers made us look at a different kind of vehicle | The EX has been perfect and both my wife and I love the car | It looks great in moonlight white with graphite interior the navigation system is wonderful my wife has no sense of direction and is not the most confident of drivers but the sat-nav always gets her to her destination | The build quality is excellent | All-in-all a great and exceptional buying and ownership experience so far | Long may it continue | Other manufacturers just couldn't come up with the goods | 
 "words": Great crossover | Fun to drive | Nice gas mileage 18-20 city and 24-26 hwy | I bought this for my wife and she is loving it | I am a big tall guy and have no problem sitting comfortably at front seats | The back seats are kind of small and Infiniti should add optional sliding back seats in 09 model | Highly recommended | 
 "words": Have had 3 Maximas in a row | Wanted a crossover with 4 wheel drive | Test drove BMW Lexus Acura and the EX35 | Loved the EX35 as soon as I drove it | Mine is fully loaded | Wondered about the gas my dealer told me to buy the middle priced gas but have been reading some of you are using the regular-no lead gas | The iPod connection makes it so easy to listen to my favorite music | 
 "words": I've been driving Mercedes for many years | I wanted to buy an SUV however hated the poor gas mileage | But I bought an EX 35 AWD anyway | Very surprising | it handles like a sedan build quality like German cars and the seats are very comfortable | I'm a happy guy | 
 "words": We owned a G35 sedan and was T-boned by a FT-150 Ford diesel truck and totaled my car | I decided to try something different and test drove BMW Mercedes and the new 09 Nissan Maxima and I didn't find what I was looking for | Needless to say the Infiniti has spoiled me | Went into the dealership and ended up falling in love with the EX | Great seats love the ride and the quiet cabin | We ended up getting one that was totally loaded and am so happy we did | Love the visibility when in reverse and absolutely love the iPod capability | I had to come back to the Infiniti the G35 was like a rock when we were hit by that BIG truck | Me and my 2 1 2 year old walked away without a scratch | 
 "words": We've just returned from a 15 day 4700 km | trip through the British Columbian Rocky Mtns | Great fun comfortable and a total joy to drive | The sport shift was terrific given the conditions | 
 "words": After 15 years driving bmws saabs and mercs I had to go Japanese | The true cost of ownership was killing me | I love the look of the European cars and the way you can really feel the road when you accelerate corner | So I didn't want to give up performance or styling when giving up euro | And Infiniti didn't disappoint in either category | Wow this car is fantastic | Still in the honeymoon phase 1st month but I can already tell that I made the right decision | I'm so happy with this car | 
 "words": I've got fully loaded EX35 and I'm glad I did | The car itself is a total pleasure to drive under any conditions from endless acceleration if you floor it to very sharp handling on a curvy road to very quiet and smooth ride on a regular street or freeway | Extremely quiet cabin and excellent Bose audio with XM makes trips much less tiresome | Cruise control that can literally stop a car when a car in front of it stops is surprisingly useful even on a city street | Voice recognition understands my accent | But above all give it a little gas to burn and feel acceleration that presses you into the seat it stays constant while you go from 0 to 80 I don't even feel tranny switching | Yeah | 
 "words": I have had my EX for 4 months | I was told by the Infiniti dealer that the car could run on regular gas and that is what I have run | I traded a G35 which I only put premium in for 4 years | I have had no problems with the car running on regular and was told it would not void my warranty | 
 "words": I have owned an I35 FX35 and M35 and now an EX35 because Infiniti makes great cars and provides great service | The best things about my EX and all my Infinitis include good gas mileage on regular no lead fuel excellent safety features my FX was destroyed and I walked away and the fact that I have NEVER had to take any of my cars in for a single warranty claim | My EX is comfortable powerful and fun to drive | I am a big guy and I am very comfortable in the car | The nav is easy to use and I like the handling and the AWD system that is intuitive and adds to the ride and handling | 
 "words": Fun to drive and quick on it's feet | this is a super vehicle | I went from a BMW X3 and the only thing I miss is the interior rear seat and luggage room | ONLY | The worse thing is the 6000-k 3600- Miles requirement for servicing where all other manufacturers are 8000-k 5000-M | is Infiniti inferior | BMW with Mobil-1 was 24000-Km | 
 "words": Fun to drive comfortable yet the back seat is tight for 2 adults | Fair gas mileage 20 city and 30 highway the car could use a 6th gear for better gas mileage | Comfortable seat for long trips
 "words": I love this car | I looked at Audi BMW and Lexus | None of their cars grabbed me like the EX | And after 5 months of ownership I know I made the right choice | It's a fun car to drive and I have plenty of room for my needs I didn't want a big gas guzzling SUV | 
 "words": Have about 3700 miles on car and love it | Only thing I needed to do was tint windows I live in FL | This changed the look of the vehicle white from the outside and helps cut down the brightness inside | Avg gas mileage around town just over 20 highway avg little over 25 | I'm happy | Single guy so leg room in back seat is not big concern to me | 
 "words": Test drove everything in the crossover category from the X6 to the Tiguan | Nothing in my opinion combined the styling luxury performance and tech features of the EX35 | Think of it as a GTI for adults if you don't need a lot of space take a serious look | The ultimate driving machine for less money | I have the Journey AWD nav | and permium package with lux style | Moonlight white w graphite int | Great looking vehicle | Getting many compliments from strangers at the pump | I'm 6'2 and very comfortable while driving my daughters have enough room in the rear seat | My golf clubs also fit in the hatch room for another set without folding the rear seats |

 "words": My wife and I bought this car yesterday after doing a lot of research on the internet and shopping around for weeks | We have the AWD Journey model with premium and nav packages | The biggest surprise for me is how small a change in handling and aggressiveness it was from our 4-cylinder Camry | The EX does not feel aggressive at all and the small turn radius keeps it from feeling like an unwieldy SUV | Supposedly it goes from 0-60 in 6 | 3 seconds and the acceleration is there when you need it but you wouldn't expect this if you aren't pushing it hard unlike the BMW 1-series which even at 10 mph lets you know it is ready to rocket you into space at any moment | But we love how it drives | 
 "words": Love my EX AWD Journey w all available packages | More comfort and convenience and much better appearance than X3 or MDX better ride than FX | Exceptional comfort performance and sound system enable me to arrive at work or at destination on business trip energetic and not tired as was the case before having my EX | Limited rear seat leg room makes this more suited for 1-2 people | adults and tall teens will probably find rear seats too confining except around town | 
 "words": I really like this little car | It drives like an Audi but is more comfortable for my tall friends and family | I am very irritated by the fuel pump quandary which is detailed below | 
 "words": Now this is luxury | This car was perfect for my family | My wife and I are in our mid 20s and we have a 4 month old baby | Drives amazingly and the interior is the best I have ever seen for the price range | The exterior makes everyone's head turn every where I go | The automatic fold down seats are the coolest ever and all the other interior add-ons really make this car great to ride in | The only down side is the MPG really stinks in the city or stop and go traffic and the cargo room really is small | The cargo space only fits our full size Stokke stroller and the grocery has to go all around it | The engine runs great and powerful off the line great handling at highway speeds and curves | 
 "words": I really think that Infiniti went over the edge when making the EX | I fell in love with this vehicle from the time I got into it | I had an option to either go with the BMW X5 or the Lexus RX 330 and hands down the Infiniti won | The ride is smoother and quieter as well | For me it worked out great | I'm single no kids and love to travel | I had a fully loaded HHR and had to trade it in after looking at this vehicle | All I have to say is keep up the good work Infiniti | 
 "words": A month ago I reviewed my new EX35 and gave it a glowing review | But didn't like the mileage or the fact that it requires premium fuel | I have now had an opportunity to take a road trip pleasantly my mileage numbers have improved | I am averaging 21 now vs 16 | 5 in the 1st month | Also I took two female adults on this 6 hour trip and they both raved about the comfort of the back seat | I wouldn't want to ask a guy to do this I wouldn't but the ladies were fine with it | Also my Bluetooth is hooked up and it is fantastic | 
 "words": On paper this is a car from heaven for tech geeks hard-drive rips and stores your CDs flash card reader for music voice activated phone and navigation intelligent cruise control lane-departure warning and prevention 4-cam virtual overhead parking image etc | Imagine having all that in your new car and then not being able to use it | Infiniti's legal department has really gone overboard in limiting what you can do with your tech if you are not stopped | Example want to find a restaurant | you can only choose from the four nearest even if 3 are behind you | Even the music system is restricted when you're driving | Insane | Really really frustrating | 
 "words": I surprised my wife with a Tidewater EX35 AWD Journey for our 25th anniversary | This crossover is wonderful | The seats are the most comfortable that I have ever experienced | I drive a Mini Cooper S daily so the the fun to drive value of the EX35 doesn't quite match up for me but it is still an enjoyable driving experience | The gadgets are awesome | After test driving the suv crossovers from BMW Nissan Lexus and Ford it was an easy choice to go with the Infiniti | For me the best part is having my wife feel like she's driving her perfect car | After 2 months she still smiles when she gets in the drivers seat | Gas mileage is 18-20 mpg | 
 "words": After test driving numerous cars BMW MB Audi Volvo I fell in love with everything about this car | The design is exceptional in and out | The ride phenomenal | And it has plenty of power | It feels great riding a car that doesn't fit the mold of typical crossovers | Everybody does a double take when I drive by | I love it | 
 "words": Being a former owner of an Infiniti fx35 I eagerly awaited the ex35 | I was impressed with virtually everything about the vehicle | The ride was much improved over the choppy kidney busting ride of my FX | Build quality materials everything great | The only thing that kept me from owning one on the spot was the lack of rear seat room | No one except leg children under 5 will be able to ride in the back | A huge disappointment for an Infiniti fan like me | But if you have no friends or kids this is worth looking at | Also ground clearance is no better than a car so forget about offroading much less jumping a curb in parking lots | 
 "words": Leased an EX35 Journey RWD Liquid Platinum Graphite Wood Trim with Premium Nav Luxe Style Roof Rails Cargo Area Protector and Cargo Organizer | I simply love the vehicle | Had purchased an '08 G35 sedan a month ago for my wife and was so impressed with it that my loaded '06 Honda Pilot EX-L V6 no longer cut it | Looked at the Acura RDX and the EX and the EX just blew it away on ride comfort noise build quality and luxury | I gave up a lot of room moving from the Pilot into the EX but in reality I am the only occupant 90 of the time and hardly ever use the back seats | Sure no more futons from IKEA in the back but the luxury features ride and sportiness more compensate | 
 "words": I have had the EX for a week now | I traded in a G35 coupe | The EX is much better for getting in and out of and storage | The moonroof has more wind noise that I would like | Also I was disappointed that the windows were not tinted | I miss the sound of the G35 | Handling is excellent | Very easy car to drive with some fun gadgets | Gas mileage is fair 18-20 around town | There is not much knee room in the back and not great cup holders also if you put tall cups in the shorter cup holders reaching the gear shift is awkward The leather seats are quite comfortable maybe not for larger indivduals due to the curving in of the seats | 
 "words": After 3K miles and 3 months of varied driving conditions the EX is as fun as legal fun gets | I keep looking for that one extra button that will initiate blast off to that groovy space station on 2001 A Space Odyssey | It would fit right in | And isn't that what a car's ultimate goal is putting you in a special place outside the drudgery of life | No it's not for a family of four | I don't ride in the backseat so that means nothing to me | The designers got it right | To lengthen it for rear leg room would ruin the lines of the car | So its not the best car for the family but when the last kid goes this rocket should be on your short-list | Up front it's all good | 
 "words": Went in looking for the G35 but when I saw the EX I loved it | Then I test drove and had to buy it | It's just the perfect size for me | Not too big of an SUV it's really a Crossover but I did not need or want anything bigger | I'm single and rarely have rear passengers so this was a perfect fit for me | It's very luxurious yet sporty | The build quality is excellent top notch | Too soon to tell the gas mileage | I've only had it for 1 month and not even at 1000 miles break-in | I'm getting about 20mpg city | 
 "words": I am a 3rd time Infiniti buyer | Traded in FX for EX and love this car | I got just about everything on it but the Tech package | I have only had it for about 3 weeks gas mileage is good 23 mpg freeway and love the sound system | Still figuring out all of the extras | I did knowingly downsize the back seats and back are much smaller than the EX and would not be comfortable for adults to sit in back seats for long drives | Remains to be seen if I regret the smaller size | Also trim around wheel well needs a small adjustment as it was not installed perfectly | Trim quality gets better every year | wood trim is nice | 
 "words": I've had the car for exactly one week 400 miles | So far I have nothing but praise | I was looking for a G37 Coupe but just couldn't get comfortable in the heavy bolstered seats | Sales person suggested I try an EX | After a few test drives I was totally sold on the car | Bought one on the spot | It is luxurious powerful quiet handles really well comfortable and the build quality is first rate | The Bose stereo is awesome | I chose not to buy the high tech pkg but everything else is there | I love the rear view camera what a pleasant surprise that has turned out to be | 
 "words": If you are an SUV owner and are thinking of buying this vehicle you will have to reconsider the definition | Yes it is a higher off the ground and yes it has room in the back but no this car will be more at home at the symphony than in woods | I bought mine a few weeks back it's the sweetest most luxurious ride I've ever had | It's beyond comfortable techonologically an Einstein and it handles like butta | It is incredibly user friendly and at first I thought it might be too elegant for me but I got over that quickly | The back seat is not the largest but it is comfortable | The prem | and nav | package were well worth it | City gas 18 | 5 mpg which ain't bad | Great job Infiniti | 
 "words": Had had about four Saabs previously and was going to get a Saab convertible when it was suggested that I try the new EX | I thought it would be too big I don't like SUVs | When I saw it I knew instantly it was a car I would like and would buy instead of lease |
