REVIEWS
 "words": This is my 5th VW and I have to say I'm quite impressed with this generation especially the 2008-2009 with the 170hp engine | The Rabbit offers a GREAT value when compared to it's competitors | Where else do you get 170hp a slick interior climate control power everything alarm etc starting at 16K | The answer is nowhere | It's no wonder the Rabbit and it's high performance brother the GTI win nearly every compact car comparison | People who complain about the gas mileage are comparing it to 4 cyl cars making 100-130hp and very little torque | This is a 5 cyl making 170 hp and 177 ft lbs | The MPG is really on par with it's power output and price range | 
 "words": My 2008 Rabbit just turned 2 last week and I love this car as much as I did the day I got it | Superb handling fun to drive comfortable reliable it has everything I wanted in a small hatchback | My neighbors have two 8-year0old Jettas that have been totally reliable so I expect my Rabbit will be the same | 
 "words": I have a 2008 rabbit and it only has 11000 miles in one year i have taken my car to the dealer 5 times and each time for a different cause | This has been the most disappointing buying experience in my life I have tried to lemon my car and the dealer has been very unhelpfull I also had a factory person come to see my car and they just keep on making excuses | 
 "words": What can I say this rabbit has been a great car I've owned mine for 1 1 2 years and NO problem | People complain about mileage I average 24 city and 30 hwy | Maybe there are some really lead footed people out there to be getting less then 17 city | And the power is great for this type of car NO its not like a V8 camaro nor a V8 mustang but peppy enough if I wanted power I would have bought a V8 car | As far as price goes you cant get a better car for it | A friend just bought a 09 civic EXL great car but cost over 21000 and mine has more room | My friends are impressed with the room this car has | The car I had before was a volvo960 wagon and the rabbit has more leg room | I will buy another one
 "words": This car has been perfect through 36000 miles following up on the near perfection of our previous 04 jetta wagon over 93000 miles | It is a surprisingly competent long-legged tourer | 
 "words": I upgraded from a 1999 | 5 MKIV Golf GLS to this 2008 2 | 5 2dr Rabbit | Awesome car | 16000 trouble free miles over my 1st year of ownership great get up and go great ride | Not as much storage space as before and the interior is not as refined as previous models but still way nicer than the same priced JDM or US cars | 
 "words": I've had this car for 9 month and I am very impressed | I used to have a Mazda 3 and it was nothing but trouble | I wasn't expecting much from VW after all their reliability problems but the car has been starting every morning without complaining | even in -20 temperatures | The car is fun to drive plenty of power and very well built | 
 "words": After about a year with my Rabbit I can finally write a review | The Rabbit is a fun little car to drive with a lot of pep | The 6 speed tiptronic transmission is a lot of fun and very unexpected in such a low price car | The interior and build quality constantly amaze me after having Fords Pontiacs Chevys | The 2 | 5 engine doesn't mind being revved and sounds pretty good when doing it | Although it is a fairly thirsty little car as I average 17 in city driving | It replaced a Crown Vic which was getting 12 so I can't complain that much | Not a bad car in winter either never got stuck once with a good set of snow tires | 
 "words": I have owned a lot of cars | I used to love rwd cars and trucks and hated fwd | I love my rabbit | The interior is way better than what my friends have | It looks great especially with my optional 5 spoke Gray wheels which sets off the look of the car | The drivers door came off set and scratched the paint warenty fixed that in 2 days | I don't understand the brakes every car I have owned gets brake dust all over the front wheels but on this car it gets dust on the rear wheels | I was really hard on them a couple times to see what they are capable of and the rear brakes got so hot I could light a cigarette off it | I don't understand it but I haven't had a problem with them yet | 
 "words": Having driven the wheels off my 1991 Toyota Tercel 200k miles I really wanted a new car | I can't believe what you get for the money | Features that would be extra on any other car are standard on my Rabbit | The only option I got was the i-pod adapter | Everything else cruise power windows locks air-con and more were standard | I love the sound of the engine and I think it has plenty of power | I wish it got a little better gas mileage but it's not too bad | I'm leasing the car now but I think that when the lease is up and the new version comes out I'm going to buy it | As long as they keep this up I'll be a VW customer from now on | 
 "words": I bought this 08 Rabbit in June and now 8 months later have no performance or build quality complains | Broke it in easy for 1500 mi | My son is the primary driver who uses it to commute back and forth to college and to work | We've taken it on 600 miles trips to NJ and Pittsburgh and mpg has been excellent at 31 highway | The only recurring issue has been the crummy head unit for the stereo | Twice the cd player has failed | Dealer overnighted a replacement the first time and I expect same replacement this time but really why the cheapo stereo | I've thrown Walmart stereo cd players into vehicles that have lasted for years with no issue | No other problems with this West Virginia Bunny | 
 "words": I bought this car after owning a Subaru Forester for 4 years | I decided that I no longer needed all wheel drive and wanted something a bit smaller and economical to own drive | I take the car in for routine maintenance as required | I was a bit disappointed when at my last service of 19400 miles I was told I needed new rear brakes | This is before fronts | VW tells me this is common to use rears that fast | Cost to replace 465 at dealer did not have it done there instead opted for local repair garage | If you had to do this every 19000 miles it does not make this care economical to drive | I am told all VW's go through brakes that fast | 
 "words": I have long wanted a VW and finally purchased a slightly used 2008 model this year | I wanted a GTI but it was out of my price range | I've test driven both and can say that the 5 cylinder Rabbit has enough power for most drivers and pretty much all driving situations | The suspension isn't as sporty read body lean in the corners but overall very fun to drive | Interior isn't as unique special as the GTI's but still full of features and very comfortable | Great car with great fuel economy | I get 28mpg with approx 80 highway driving | 
 "words": I did a lot of research into Civics and Rabbits and finally decided on the Rabbit | I love love it | It's amazingly fun to drive has great pickup and lots of bells and whistles that the Civic definitely lacks | The road noise is a little loud but the 10 speaker stereo system drowns it out just fine | I would definitely recommend | 
 "words": I have the car over here in Germany and it is great the 2 | 5 engine is a dream strong and smooth | Gas mileage is fine and it uses regular gas | The engine to me is better than the German Twin Charger 1 | 4L drove one while my car was being servicedIf the 2010 Rabbit has this engine I will buy that | 
 "words": This is truly an amazing vehicle for the price outstanding performance | The 2008 Rabbit handles better than my 528i BMW you never feel like you are losing control | Tight going into and coming out of turns | And acceleration | this car responds | I'm 6' 1 and fit comfortably | Controls are easy to reach and intuitive well designed interior | Yes it is very enjoyable to drive and exceeds my expectations for a car under 20k | When driving conservatively the car averages around 27-28 MPG highway gets 30 MPG easy | 
 "words": What a great car | Great fuel economy comfortable for the driver and her dog | Great leg and head room sun roof adds extra light and great visibility | A couple of squeaks in the dash but that is to be expected from a my 3rd VW | For the price warranty the standard extras and fun | you can't go wrong with this car | 
 "words": I bought my Rabbit in June of '08 as a replacement for my '06 Nissan Frontier which was swallowing gas by the gallon and losing value faster than the Big 3 and couldn't be happier | My Rabbit is a great car | The 6 speed Triptonic Auto is more than I could have ever asked for | Very peppy car will go when you want it to at the expense of poor mileage however | I average 21 or so in the city and up to 28 on a freeway trip | Interior quality is second to none love that German engineering | 
 "words": We purchased a used 2008 VW Rabbit for my wife to drive | She went from a Jeep to a VW | We also own a 2001 | 5 VW Passat Wagon which we purchased new | Anyone who purchases a VW should be aware that owning a VW is an experience with potentially expensive upkeep and maintenance | Also the service at some VW dealers has been horrendous at best | The Rabbit is a well thought out car with many creature comforts not found on other cars | It drives and rides like a German car should is solidly built and has none of the tinny feel of other small cars | The doors feel solid and the 5 cylinder is strong | Just be prepared to pay for maintenance and upkeep | 
 "words": First I didn't give any 10's because something has to be literally perfect | That said for the money a great car | It's broken in and the last 3 fill ups have been right around the 30 mpg combined mark | I drive very conservatively and about 60 40 hwy cty | 5 spd manual allows low rpm shifting as well | 5th gear could be taller for the highway or a 6th gear would help out too | Car comes standard with a good number of things like remote entry | Fun to drive and well made | I'm coming from a 2006 C-Class MB so I had high expectations | Seems to have met them so far | 
 "words": This is a great carwith a powerful engine | I own the 6 speed tiptronic transmission which matches great with the engine giving me the feeling that I am driving a more expensive car 
 "words": This car is incredible for the money | It has great power and it's built like a rock meaning there are NO rattles | The quality of this car is better than any other car you will find for under 20000 except for other VW's | The manual transmission is the smoothest shifting transmission I have ever used | I drove 60 mph on my way to college in Maine and got 35 mpg for highway driving which was much better than I expected | Just a great car and more VW's will be purchased in my future | 
 "words": This car is the perfect compromise of all the requirements I have for a vehicle | I wanted something more fuel efficient and smaller than the truck I was driving it had to be comfortable fun to drive and have room for my dog | I looked at every 4 door hatch on the market especially the fit versa and the Astra | The Rabbit is the only vehicle in that group that feels like a real car | It feels like a budget BMW with comfortable seats an excellent driving position and a wonderful 6spd automatic | OK like most other people I wish it got better mpg but you do have to consider the solid safe car you are driving | I'm seeing 25 mpg in mixed spirited driving | You can do better with practice | 
 "words": The first thing you need to understand about this car is | It's not the most fuel efficient hatchback out there | However it is fun fun fun to drive | If you're like me and performance is important to you for the price you can't beat it | Drove the Civic lx ex and Nissan Sentra | Boring by comparison | Nice cars but no power | Suspension is a little soft for me it rides well though but what do you want for 16800 dollars | I have alloy wheels and iPod adapter built in the armrest with rear seat air vents trip computer 10 speaker stereo | The 4 door jumps in price to around 20000 dollars | The Honda dealership wanted around 20000 out the door for an lx Civic coupe | Rabbit was 18 | 
 "words": It started out being a nice car but since then it has been nothing but headaches | It seems like one thing after another something goes wrong | 1st off the power windows quit working and now the check engine light keeps coming on and VW doesn't no how to fix it | All in all this is my 1st VW and it will be my last | 
 "words": I've owned my Rabbit now for a little over a month | Each and every day I look forward to the commute to work because the Rabbit is so much fun to drive | No problem merging onto the highway or passing slower traffic | The ride is firm but smooth and engine response is immediate | I test drove the Scion tC Mazda-3 Toyota Matrix Ford Focus Subaru Impreza and Chevy Cobalt | None of them could touch the Rabbit in terms of overall feel and build quality | If you're looking for an inexpensive fun car don't pass up test driving the Rabbit | 
 "words": I have had the car for about 3 months and can not say enough praise about it | Very versatile peppy and an overall amazing car | I have a slightly above average commute and the mileage isn't bad at all even in the city | Inside ample space and comfort makes it a great alternative to an SUV or Crossover whatever that is | Fun little easter eggs inside and out make me say Well thats smart | 
 "words": I've had this car for about 5 weeks and put 2000 miles on it | For the price under 18k with 170 hp 6 speed auto Tiptronic you really can't beat it | 95 of the mileage is city driving and I avg 17 | 9 mpg which isn't great but I do drive quite aggressively | Overall the car feels quite well-built and given that I used to manage a valet lot and have driven Audi BMW Porsche Lexus Jaguar etc that is pretty impressive especially at this price point | In my opinion you are basically getting a GTI at an economy car price and my insurance is far cheaper than it would be with a sports car | The only downside is the fuel economy but if you can get past that this car is a winner | 
 "words": After exhaustive research and test drives I went with the Rabbit | I bought the 4-door with the manual transmission which I hear is a combination that won't be available next year | Not to mention I really don't like the looks of the next generation Rabbit | I knew the gas mileage wasn't great before I bought the car so I'm not all that disappointed | I love the torque this thing really pulls even from off-idle | The driving position and controls are top notch | I wish the diesel was available when I bought this would've been a no-brainer | The inline-5 is a weird-sounding engine not really worth revving up | All in all I'm happy with it |

 "words": Just bought the 2008 Rabbit | This car drives and handles like a much more expensive sports sedan | Corners flat and has super good brakes | The 6 speed tiptronic trans is flawless and will provide excellent highway miles | The Rabbit has to be one of the best performance buys for a small sedan on the earth today | Typical excellent VW fit and finish on par with BMW and Audi |

 "words": I've had my 08 rabbit for almost a year now and haven't had any major complaints so far | I actually like the placement of the iPod dock in the center console since it hides it from prying eyes | I don't like the way the radio system controls it though | The interior is nice and very well laid out and roomy and I'm pretty tall | Everyone that has been inside the rabbit always comments on how much room they have even in the back seat | The side panels on the interior do scuff pretty easily though but they are also easy to clean | On the road it feels like a substantial car but is easy to toss around | 
 "words": My experience is a lot like Sharon's | My decision was between the Honda Civic and VW Rabbit and I ultimately decided on the Rabbit as I preferred the look and it seemed more fun to drive | I really should have put more stock into the gas mileage | I mostly do all my driving in the city pure stop lights and traffic the whole way to work and back | I'm seriously averaging between 10-17 MPG in the city | I can't tell you how stressed out I am about this | Instead of enjoying this gorgeous little car I loathe having to drive anywhere because all I can think about is the gas mileage | I've been told there is a break in period but if I could do it again I'd get something else | 
 "words": When it was time to get a new car I was torn between 2 cars | 2008 Honda Civic and the 2008 VW Rabbit | I test drive these 2 and really liked both cars | But time to decide which to get is a pain | Anyway emotions got better of me and so I picked the Rabbit | It has pickup power and appeal | However the gas mileage sucks | Literally | I drive on the highway at 60 mph trying to save everyday but still get about 25-miles to the gallon | City mileage forget it | It | 's nowhere close to the sticker mileage | It's more like 9-20 mph | I am gypped and I am not enjoying this car at all | I AM DISAPPOINTED | So there that's my honest opinion | I should've gotten the Civic | City mileage is 39 mph | 
 "words": I have had this cutie for a week and compared to every car I test drove in its price range you get the most bang for your buck on this one | with heated front seats ABS and traction control as standard equipment the rabbit comes out head of its class every time |

 "words": This is my sixth VW so since I have survived VW's reliability problems I must like them | This car is a good value for money with features that competitors can only dream of | In Canada heated seats are an essential | why don't more manufacturers make this available and how about heated steering wheels | 
 "words": had it only 2 weeks but driving A LOT | my first experience in a rabbit made a terribly disconcerting metallic rubbing whine when i test drove one initially with alloy wheels pkg | but the one i bought had the steel wheels and no such noises | still have quite a bit of clutch pedal travel compared to my subaru outback and am still trying to get used to launching without excessive revving maybe i'm just a retard and while in 1st 2nd gears torque dies around 3500 rpm | i expected more torque since due to 177 lb | ft | rating | shoulda bought the DSG auto trans in retrospect | wished leather seats were available | almost dislocated my left shoulder reaching back for the safety belt | 
 "words": I drive mostly city in San Francisco and it handles the bumps just fine | Zips in and out of traffic | 5sp manual is much easier to manage vs | my old 2000 passat 6cyl | Lacking torque just a bit at the very low end but you can start from 2mph in 2nd if it's flat terrain | Interior materials are fantastic | On mostly city driving with hills I'm getting 17mpg but it's San Francisco | I estimate pure hwy at 29 but I got 30 in my Passat V6 | Same passenger volume as in B5 Passat | This is ingenious | On reliability had valve problem dealer replaced entire cylinder head and car was in shop for 3 weeks |

 "words": Bought car expecting to like it | Didn't expect to LOVE it | I needed something cheap to insure and was still fun and good on gas emissions | This best fit the bill after many test drives of the competition | Couldn't be happier | Value for the buck is truly the key here | 
 "words": This car is great fun to drive | The build quality is excellent | it has plenty of power and torque and the manual shifter is butter smooth | I was looking for an economical hatchback that would serve as a city car and also be comfortable on long trips | A hatchback made the most sense since the most usual passenger is a 100lb | hound | He doesn't mind that the rear windows don't open | Still with the back seat up the car has plenty of room for the grandkids | My only complaint is having found the ideal seat steering wheel combo I can't seem to adjust the seatbelt away from my neck |

 "words": Bought my Shadow Blue 08 Rabbit 2 months ago and driven it 3200 miles | I've already done a 1000 mile road trip and driven my kids to school regularly | I look for reasons to hop in the Bunny and drive | It's really fun to drive and scoots through trafic like a knife through butter | I've driven Toyotas Mazdas Hondas and Nissans and while they've been decent cars nothing comes close to the Rabbit in build quality interior design the plethora of features on a base model and best of all the sheer fun factor | 
 "words": Originally I was looking for an upgrade to a small SUV but couldn't find anything with pep decent MPG and a sticker below 25000 | So on to the hatches | 20-22k was more in the price range and the Rabbit perfectly fits the bill | This thing has so much ROOM for a hatch | It's amazing | The only roomy complaint I have is that the drivers knees are slightly cramped | There is plenty of length but something feels a little too tight when it comes to the steering wheel and the knees | But that's it | That's about the only complaint | The interior exterior ride zip power handling and features are way beyond the competition | 4door auto ESP sunroof alloys and 170HP for 20k | Nice |

 "words": The Rabbit is fun to drive and inexpensive to purchase | Handling is very good | Acceleration from the 170 horse 5 cylinder is vastly better than the approx 120 horsepower and 4 cylinders of most cars at this price point | Interior space is good compared to the small exterior | From its price and size you might think it is an economy car but it is not | Gas mileage is poor pathetic 22 MPH after 4 tanks | Dependability ratings are not nearly as good as an Asian car either | If you think of it as an inexpensive sports car you will be happy if you think of it as something in the class of a bullet proof Honda or Toyota you may be disappointed | Overall I am neither very happy or unhappy with it | 
 "words": Searched for over 3 months to replace an aging Jeep | I wanted a hatchback for its space and size | We looked at the Fit Versa Mazda3 Mini Caliber and numerous others | The finish and quality of the Rabbit was the best | The performance is outstanding I love the turn radius and size | With my old cherokee I had a little extra space in my garage | With the Rabbit I have even more with the same responsiveness and HP as the old 4 | 0L inline 6 in the Jeep with significantly better gas mileage it doubled | The dealership I purchased it encouraged naming it so we now call it Rascal | after Elmer Fudd wascally wabbit
 "words": I am 100 satisfied with my Rabbit | For me the Rabbit was a perfect balance of economy and performance | I had considered a whole spectrum of vehicles- from a Toyota Yaris to a Mazda Mazda3 hatchback | The VW Rabbit sits somewhere in between those two models in terms of mpg and is competitive with the Mazda3's performance though I might say the Mazda has better handling | One thing that the Rabbit and German cars in general have over any other car I was considering was it's awesome build quality | My Rabbit is a small car and is by no means a tank but it feels as strong and tough as one | Hondas and Toyotas feel like tin cans compared to VW's | The Rabbit is also very zippy and fun to drive | 
 "words": I can not believe that VW can make a car with this much substance and performance and sell it profitably for the 15500 I paid | This car has a similar driving dynamic to the BMW I used to own that's a high compliment | You look at this car from the outside and think nice little economy car and you drive it and think holy cow this is a BMW hatchback |
