REVIEWS
 "words": I've had problems with the electrical systems door locks wipers Navigation system and now worst of all the brakes | I went metal to metal on the rears after 33000 miles | the calipers are failing to retract properly thus Pads wearing out totally prematurely | Normally a car goes thru 3 sets of front pads to 1 set of rears | I've had my car serviced by dealerships only thus far | When they rotate the tires I ask them to check the brakes since the wheels are already off | Well At the time of last visit to the dealership 22363 miles All was well now 11000 miles later My right rear roter is shot on the inside only due to a defective caliper | What can I do about it | 
 "words": I traded in my 2006 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab b c my family needed a more comfortable ride for long trips | We looked at the Avalanche but really no difference from the Sierra with cabin space and comfort | The Denali rides like a dream | My truck had the old 5 | 3L V8 and felt just a little under- powered | The Denali with the new 6 | 2L V8 has plenty of power from towing my boat to accelerating for passing on the interstate or even accelerating on the interstate while pulling the boat | Average gas mileage for my driving style is the same as the Sierra but definitely sucks more gas in town | Very comfortable quiet ride | I do miss having a truck but that's what utility trailers are for | 
 "words": Yes I said Surburban because after 25 Chevrolets I traded up to a GMC- I liked the Styling better This is a quantum leap in vehicle quality styling and interor design | It's quiet comfortable and roomy | The 5 | 3 with multi displacement is smmoth- can't even tell when its in 4 cyl mode | Remote start is a hit and the tri zone AC is a winner- everyone gets their temp selection
 "words": Vehicle broke down on us 5 times in less than 6 months and the dealership could not figure out the problem or lack of trying to figure out the problem | One day someone got a bright idea to see if any another dealerships are experiencing the same problem the vehicle will start until it gets hot but don't turn it off because it won't start up again | Anyhoo some other dealer was having that same problem and at last it was fixed | 
 "words": I love driving my '08 Yukon Denali | The power is good the comfort is awesome and it's just a nice SUV to drive | With the deals out there on these trucks it's definitely worth checking out | I got 16k off sticker on a loaded '08 towards the end of the model year | 
 "words": I have driven and owned many automobiles | The Denali is a pleasure to drive | I traded my TrailBlazer in for the new Denali and the gas is not any worse than my TrailBlazer | It was a nice auto | I looked at every auto maker Toyota Lexus and others from outside the country only to find not one could pull me away from GMC | 
 "words": I purchased a 2008 4WD GMC Yukon SLE for my wife after she wrecked her 2004 Honda Pilot | We initially were going to purchase another Pilot however being the savvy consumer I also looked at the Dodge Aspen the GMC Acadia and the Buick Enclave | While we were at the GMC dealer my wife noticed the Yukon after she test drove the Buick Enclave | We decided to give it a test drive and Wow | was I impressed | Even after just driving a loaded Buick Enclave the Yukon stood out as a more comfortable smoother and much more roomy vehicle | Plus with the 8000 dollar cash back incentive coupled with employee pricing it was an easy decision to make | 
 "words": This is a very nice vehicle my wife loves the smooth ride | I enjoy knowing my family is safe with the AWD stabletrac system | Avg 14 MPG but I knew that prior to purchasing a small price to pay for safety and luxury | 
 "words": This truck rides and looks great | It's been nothing but a pleasure since I purchased it 2 mos ago and I would go back tomorrow and do it all over again | I have three friends that own Escalades and they love my truck especially for 10K less because it drives and looks identical | My other cars are a BMW 750 LI and a BMW 545 but we like driving the truck | Gas mileage is averaging about 14 MPG but my 7 Series gets only about 20 MPG and the 5 Series gets 18 MPG both premium and this truck runs on mid- grade | Go get a good deal on one today | 
 "words": My '08 Denali Yukon XL SUV came to me after GM lemon lawed my first Denali | So now I have a second one | This one had little problems until yesterday | It suddenly dropped dead on the road | It went completely dead | Absolutely nothing worked including the much vaulted OnAtar | It did not work at all | I had to use my cell phone to call the dealer who called OnStar and after a 2 hour wait a tow truck came and flatbedded the 2 ton dead whale to the dealer | I am sorely outraged that a 4 week old so called 'premier' vehicle should totally drop dead on the road stranding the occupants | The dealer could not determine what the problem is and now I am once again victimized by GM | Bummer | 
 "words": Great truck horrible gas mileage | I've averaged 15 mpg | This truck has plenty of power great ride quiet cabin except for the roar of my V8 when I accelerate | leg room is great | I'm 6'5 tall and love to sit in the back with my toddler when my wife drives | I wish I had opted for more options and the Tahoe is exactly the same truck but several hundred dollars cheaper similarly equipped at most dealerships | If you don't do long commutes and have a need for lots of room you can't go wrong with a Yukon or Tahoe | I have 40000 miles and have never had any problems | 
 "words": Just so nobody gets confused after reading all of the other reviews | the biggest complaint was fuel economy | I gave fuel economy a 10 because I knew what I was getting into and the fuel economy is expected per the size and weight of the vehicle | I have owned 17 cars and the thus far my 2008 SLT Yukon is the best one | It has a lot of interior space | it performs well on the back roads and highways | the seats are very comfortable for short and long trips | it is fun and easy to drive | the all instruments are within arms and easily accessible | and the configuration of all instruments are easily learned | 
 "words": I test drove 6 vehicles before I settled for this one | This one wasn't even my 1st choice but I couldn't pass up the great deal I was getting and so far its been good | The handling is pretty good and fuel economy is what can be expected out of an AWD SUV | The vehicle comes with a lot of standard featuresdenali like heated seats remote start etc | My only real problem is the 3rd row seat | Does not fold down to the ground and is made for children | Other models like the 2008 Toyota Sequoia and 2008 Lincoln Navigator can sit full grown adults back there and does fold down to the ground and other crossovers of GM do this so why not the full size SUVs | 
 "words": We were putting to many miles on our 2005 Cayenne S and needed a second SUV | After doing tons of research I found the Denali to be the best value in it's class | The ride and comfort are a plus the 6 | 2 V8 has a lot of power but is slow in getting there | The transmission needs improvement it could be a little smoother | We found the Denali worked best for us on long trips four adults can travel in sheer comfort | 
 "words": I havearound 10000 kms on this truck | It works great and has lots of power and speed | I have a 97 yukon gt too and this has 400000 sobig fan of yukons | This one has alot more technolgy than the old one but both are great 
 "words": Love the Denali | Build quality is much improved | Far more power and even better ride than my previous SUV Toyota Sequoia and my 2007 H2 | 
 "words": I have owned GM vehicles for 15 years now and this is by far the best I have ever had | I owned mostly 2 Chevys until this one | Looked for over 5 months and compared the Tahoe Ford and Yukon and it was not close | The Yukon just looked and felt better | I saw the Yukon on the road and it always made me stop and look | Gas is hard but it is for everyone right now | Only complaint I have is the folding 3rd row seat | Don't know if it is just mine but it is difficult to move and almost impossible to replace is removed | Should have looked at power seats there | 
 "words": This is my 6th SUV and I must say it is by far the best | I've only had the Yukon for 2 months and have put 2K miles on it but so far it has been totally problem free | As it is getting broken in the performance and gas mileage currently between 18 and 19 are improving | For its large size it corners really well which I attribute to the stabilizer bars | If put into passing gear around 50 it appears a little anemic so if I were to do it all over I may opt for the 5 | 3 liter or get 3 | 73 rear end | 
 "words": I have owned 3 Chevy Tahoes I decided to opt for the Yukon this time big difference between my last 2004 Chevy to the 2008 Yukon the ride is great my only drawback is the rear captian chairs it leaves no room for a full grown teenager let alone an adult | GM should consider putting the bluetooth function in but then it would kill the deal with on-star and verizon | I put 22 inch wheels on the car I am getting a little rub with 305 45 22 and the ride has gotten a bit harder | Other than that I am very happy
 "words": We purchased the GMC 08 Denali after many reviews and this SUV offered the best value compared to the other optionsBMWLexusFordetc | We love the way it drives comfortable layout nice interior features | If you are looking for 30 MPG this is not your vehicle | The only negative is the gas mileage but we knew that before buying it | I strongly recommend the GMC Denali if you like great performance 6 | 2L V-8 for towinggreat interior featuresheated seatssteering wheelcomfortable seating with lots of room and nice look new body style from the 2006 denali | I would recommend one to my friends and family but get a gas card | 
 "words": I've owned or been around GM products for years | They have evolved over the years into real world class vehicles | This new Yukon is absolutely fabulous | It's huge but gets reasonable gas mileage for it's size | It's quiet roomy classy looking and handles well | We considered the Land Rover LR3 but frankly don't need and wouldn't use the off road capability | The LR3 is a very nice truck with snob appeal | It's certainly no nicer and certainly does not have the reliability of a GM product | It's expensive but in line with it's competitors | Get the 20 wheels and handling improves impressively | 
 "words": Just purchased an new 2008 Denali and I am loving this vehicle | The grade of leather and the amount of features make driving almost like flying a jet | Engine has great acceleration and the interior of the car is very plush |
