REVIEWS
 "words": The first time I saw this Barcelona Red Scion I loved it and it has proven to be a good purchase | I needed a reliable car to bomb about town and for short range 500 miles highway trips although took did a 2000 mile trip and car preformed great | I also needed good cargo capacity and excellent gas mileage | It has proven itself on all counts | The red color is very easy to spot among all the silver cars in big parking lots | I also keep the rear seat down for hauling cargo | mostly golf clubs and groceries | 
 "words": I loved this beast | Great performance great handling great ergonomics | I hauled my wife two kids and a pop-up trailer all over | This is a great small- family | We sadly had to part ways as there is a third child coming soon but if Scion would have built a stretched version ala the Mazda5 we just traded for we would have stayed in the Scion stable for a third run | 
 "words": I have driven from GA to Key West and back its a great car to drive in city but sure above average car in the Hwy | Road Handling is great and does not feel like a small car fear factor | I own a Maxima also and closely pay attention to the quality and overall performance | Recommend this for city zip zag | Many people compare this to Honda Fit which I think is not the right comparison due the techinal specs to start with and also road drive pleasure in this is great | But what I wish Toyota can good better is the road noise to compensate they have a great Pioneer system which is far better than Bose which I have in Maxima | Overall a strong buy recommendation | Good Luck

 "words": After a lot of research and test drives one year later I still stand by my purchase It has the most features style for the price | I drove this car cross-country packed with all of my valuables | The Honda Fit would not have had the power to merge with semis in the Colorado mountains at 75 mph while getting 40 avg mpg | Thank the xD's Toyota 2ZR-FE Dual VVT-i 128hp engine | I bought this car to drive in LA so the active head restraints sideview mirror signals the airbags for myself AND rear passengers were a major selling point | My friends love the interior design stereo comfortable seats too | Compared Honda Fit Sport Civic Toyota Yaris Hatch Sedan Mini Cooper

 "words": Price was OK but I might not buy it again | Screw went into tire sidewall in July 08 but no tire dealer had the odd ball size took a week to order | Radio doesn't receive my favorite stations 90 Nissan did perfectly | Owners manual says to use only 0w-20 oil or 5w-20 but Castrol won't sell it to consumers | my favorite auto shop doesn't buy it in bulk | Very noisy ride so much so that dog doesn't like it | Doors seem to lock mysteriously with no door key lock on passenger side have to go around | Dash gauges can be seen only by pushing button not safe to do while driving odometer should always be visible |

 "words": Long time Honda owner no mas change to Toyota Scion and happy | Many Civics Accords CRV never again | Anyway I traded in the new to me 06 Xa which was a fantastic car just wanted to upgrade and that is what I feel like the Xd is | I drive fast on the freeway and in traffic and this car is as stated feels more substantial less darty more powerful | Inside the console is ergonomic there are a lot more standard features and I am 5'10 200 lbs and no problem with room | In short I believe the Xd is a great replacement for the Xa and I really enjoyed my Xa half of the miles where on the open highway the other half in Phoenix the city of bad drivers |

 "words": Next week I will have had my Xd for 6 months and have seen only one other so hence my choice of title | I traded an '01 Highlander and think this is a better vehicle when considering everything | styling ride comfort gas mileage etc | Also I think it is better than my '98 Landcruiser and my '95 4Runner all things considered | I have had people quiz me about it and everyone loves it | Why doesn't Scion push this vehicle | When I tell people I have an Xd they assume it is an Xb | Nobody has heard of it | Also Toyota is bringing out a vehicle called the Urban Cruiser currently only for Europe | Guess What | It is a 4-wheel drive Xd | Buy this car -you'll love it
 "words": I was looking at hatchbacks for months as a commuter car | I wanted side curtain airbags cruise control and 30mpg or better | Compared to the Honda Fit- the seats aren't as comfy and the sport version for cruise control costs more | Nissan Versa- the back seats aren't as versatile don't fold flat Toyota Yaris- no cruise and not as much interior space Hyundai Accent-no cruise control Chevy Aveo- less power and no cruise control Volkswagen Rabbit- less mpg and more expensive Subaru Impreza less mpg but a good 2nd choice Suzuki S- less mpg lack of many dealerships nearby This was the best for the overall | It came with everything I wanted standard |

 "words": I traded in my 2003 BMW 325i for the xd car | At first I didn't even think much about looking at the Scion brand because it is marketed to younger people and I am a middle age mom | With my BMW I became concerned about gas mileage and upkeep costs | When it was time to trade the car in I had my mind set on a Prius but after driving the Prius I happened to look over and see an xD | The salesman was reluctant but I insisted on driving the vehicle and loved it | When I saw that it gets only about 11 mpg less than the Prius with a 10K price difference I was sold | My kids call it the Wii car which is funny | Avg 42 hwy 35 city |

 "words": Purchased our XD after looking at similar products | Our biggest reason for purchasing was for reliability and resale value as we may not hold it for too long | Gas mileage was a consideration as well | I consistently gets 28-30 both highway and city | Even all highway was only 30 which was a little disappointing | My wife's only real complaint in the comfort of the seats for her she is shorter | The ride is nice | It sits higher than our 2000 altima which is very nice and the higher body doesn't drag the bumper on our driveway we live in Pittsburgh w lots of hills | Overall we feel like it was a good purchase but w our 1st baby on the way it won't be long before we need more room | 
 "words": I bought this car along with my trade in of a '93 Honda Civic | I researched similar cars of this type and budget including the Honda Fit Nissan Versa Toyota Yaris and Honda Civic | It was a final contest between the xD and the Civic but I found out that Scion is Toyota and the xD uses the same 2ZR-FE engine as in her more expensive cousin Toyota Corolla | The fact that my last Civic died on me at a red light in a crime infested neighborhood during after hours tells me much about Honda's true reliability | 
 "words": I was looking for something inexpensive reliable and stylish | I'd pretty much had my heart set on the scion tc but I had hesitations about getting a 2 door so I got the xd instead | This car is ok but I have a few somewhat major gripes | There are HUGE blind spots on either side near the rear windows a tiny back window so when I want to change lanes I feel like I'm taking a risk even with turning my head to look and using my mirrors | The brake system is weird and even though it's supposed to respond to a 'light tap' I have to press pretty hard to get the car to stop and it's a very bumpy ride even going over parking lot speed bumps feels like off-roading in rough terrain | 
 "words": Such a great little car | especially for the price | The gas mileage is fantastic | After 5K miles I have consistently averaged 36 MPG with combined in city hwy street driving | Highway mileage alone has come in as high as 42MPG | This car is fun easy to drive-turn-park and fits me perfectly | My hubby 6' 3 hubby purchased an XB and I fell in love with it with one exception | it's just TOO big inside | I found myself having to reach too far for everything | But the XD has everything at perfect arms length | And the clutch is light and the manual trani is easy to shift | The only negative is that at 5K it has more little noises than I would have expected from a Toyota product | 
 "words": I bought this little gem after having driven a '99 Windstar for almost 10 years | It took a little getting used to the change in size but overall this has been a great choice in vehicle | I mostly drive in town but occasionally get on the highway | I find I get decent mileage in town and excellent mileage on the open road | The car defies the laws of physics | It is very comfortable for even large people and can hold a LOT more cargo than it looks | I love how I can whip in and out of parking spots easily or slip into the next lane of traffic without cutting off the guy behind me | Overall it's been a great car to drive and the money I save on gasoline is a dream | 
 "words": Having been driving a 1995 Honda Civic CX Hatchback for the last 10 Years this was definitely different | After studying Hondas and Toyotas I had it in my mind to either buy a Corola or a Civic Both have exceptional Engines that last for quite a long time | Determined to go to the Honda dealership and the Toyota dealership before I actually buy | My first stop was at the Toyota dealership | After the salesman showed me a few corolas on sale then he showed me a Scion XD | Having no idea about Scions At the time I didn't know they were toyotas I just thought they were another cheap brand he explained in detail about the scion brand | After test driving the Scion and Corola I bought the XD | 
 "words": I've had it for a while and I'd have to say it's a great cheap car | I just took a trip and managed 42 mpg on the highway while around town I'm getting about 32 mpg | It has some power if you get on it but the manual transmission is awful | The Interior is awesome as well as the body design and people are always checking it out on the street | 
 "words": Bought this guy a couple of months ago as an all-around hauler | I drive about 75 miles a day for work was looking for practicality and fun | Also use on weekends for trips to see our daughter at college etc | Very pleased with the xD | Lowered with TRD springs from dealer rear spoiler bumper protector | Have not used for overnight trip but hauls four adults with ease we are all short and occasionally five for trips around town | Looked also at the Honda Fit also nice but glad I chose the xD | 33-36 miles per gallon measured at fill-ups 35-39 average on readout | Ride w TRD springs is firm but comfortable | Co-worker has an xD also and has had good experience highly recommended | 
 "words": I purchased the xD in March 2008 and have six months experience driving it | Fuel economy has been a steady 34 mpg calculated | I have had only one incident where the Vehicle Stabilization Control system automatically worked its magic | It was during a highway run climbing a hill during a rainstorm when traction was especially bad | The system kicked in at a time when I was unaware that I was losing traction | I maintained control with its aid slowed downand carried on with my trip all smoothly safely done | This VSC is a worthwhile feature | One slight but nagging shortfall in the design of this car is the FEEL of the brakes they operate well but are vague in their feel | 
 "words": When I was first looking at cars to buy I was trying to find an SUV | I wanted a vehicle that I could put stuff in the back of home depot trips etc | Unfortunately gas shot up to like 4 a gallon that day so I got rid of the SUV idea | After a lot of researching and reviewing i went with the xD for its gas mileage fold- down back seats my friend and I can finagle our mountain bikes in there and trips to home depot are no problem a low price tag and the Toyota built engine | I've had the car about 6 months now and i couldn't be happier | It's definitely got some pep to it when you hit the gas too | Good for light stuff just don't expect to do any heavy hauling | 
 "words": Overall I am completely satisfied with my Scion xD | I purchased a 2008 xD in May 2008 because I commute 140 miles round trip | The xD has all the air bags ABS and cruise control standard unlike some other small cars I looked at Toyota Yaris Honda Fit | My commute is half open freeway and half stop and go freeway | My fuel efficiency averages 35 MPG during the summer with the AC on all the time | I expect it to go up in the fall and winter | The xD is comfortable although the seats could be a little cushier | I think the gauges are well placed | Not having an arm rest doesn't bother me | Main drawback is blocking the sun from the door window | The sun visor doesn't have an extension | 
 "words": This was my wife's first new car | We bought it because of the look the navigation system but mostly because of the expected great fuel economy | I don't have much to say about the design besides that there should be an arm rest and it is crazy that the nav system doesn't allow you to use some of the options when the car is moving | The only real disappointment is the gas mileage | I read many reviews that stated 30 and much more on trips | We have never seen anything better than 26-27 gallon city or highway or some combination | I know it's not way off but I was planning to see better than what we are getting | 
 "words": I can not got anything better for the price scion is the best I really enjoy drive this car every day | 
 "words": I bought this car in February 08 when we sold our Xterra | Already own a 06 corolla and like Toyotas | This car is zippy good gas mileage 31 city 33 hwy and looks great | Standard power everything cruise you name it | The safety features are all standard- side seat and front air bags | Good thing too | A guy in a stolen car ran me off the road and into the concrete median in the middle of the hwy going about 65 mph and I walked away with a sprained wrists and burns scrapes from the seat belt and airbags | The car didn't make it but it did it's job | Loved that little car and will miss it but thankful for the fun it gave me and the life it saved | 
 "words": I debated which to buy the Honda Fit or the Scion XD | I decided that I liked the body style better with the XD I also liked the larger wheels which came standard on the XD 16 as opposed to the Honda Fit 14 | I am so happy with the XD | I drive 150 miles a day to from work so I log a lot of miles quickly | I am now up to 11800 miles and have not had a problem | It is comfortable and roomy for 4 adults | We recently took it from Ann Arbor to Chicago for a soccer tournament and had plenty of room for all four adults we just made sure to pack lightly as there is not a lot of room for numerous suitcases but then again that is not what I bought it for | I highly recommend this car | 
 "words": I wanted to get a car that is good on miles reliable I was only looking for a Japanese car and safe | I've researched so many cars for a few months and it was b w Civic or Xd | I decided to buy Xd bc of its long list of standard options for this price and was pretty much in love when I test drove one- it zips very well inside is roomy and I actually like its cute looks | I've only put 200 miles on and still have a half gas tank | I got close to 42 miles on highway and I'm getting about 31 | 5 miles in a city drive with A C on most of the timethe weakest level though | I'll get 18 inch wheels that makes the car look a lot better | I would buy one again I love it | 
 "words": Gas Gas Gas | What can I say that would make a person downgrade upgrade from a souped up 89 Toyota Supra Vroom | problem child gas sucka tricked out supped up 04 PT Cruiser Turbo Ehh | but still gas sucka | to a 08 almost tricked out but not there yet Scion XD | Moving from the Bay area to Virginia I honestly did not think I would ever trade in my PT but after experiencing the WORST commuter traffic in the USA and VA to DC eats the cake over Marin County to Alameda County I had to ditch the PT | I test drove the Fit Yaris and Corolla before the XD | But the XD won in the end for gas as well as over all styling | 
 "words": After 3 months of research my decision was b w Civic and Xd | I decided to buy Xd because of its long list of standard features for the price | I just got it last week and have put 200 miles on and still have a half gas tank | My average MPG is 31-32 and I got almost 42 on highway | I cant wait to stretch this car out- a full tank of gas keeps this car running for 350-400 miles I reckon which is great | I love the audio control it lets you concentrating your eyes on traffic | I will get 18 inch wheels sometimes it makes this car look more luxury check the parts online though it can be done cheaper | Oh and this little car zips really well too | 
 "words": Me and my fiancé brought a scion XD about two weeks ago and we both love it | We need something else to drive other then our Denali that has a drinking problem at the moment | We went from putting 110 every four days to 36 every two weeks | We also added the TRD muffler TRD lowering springs TRD 18 | rims scion neon blue door trim upgraded pioneer system and rear spoiler | 
 "words": I had to go looking for another car after i was in a car accident in my former scion xA hydroplaned at 60 mph hit a guardrail and flipped over yet walked away without a scratch so i wanted another car that was safe and reliable and still had great gas mileage | well the xD was the perfect car for driving and style | It's different and you almost never see another one on the road i average 37- 40 mpg depending on where I'm driving it's extremely easy to move in and out of traffic due to its small design and its extremely safe crash test ratings and standard side airbags set my mind at ease | I will be keeping this car for a long time | 
 "words": We just traded in our gas guzzling minivan for this cute little car and what a great decision it was | The dealership did not budge on the 15700 sticker price for the base model which was loaded no complaints there with the manual transmission but it was still a fabulous price | We are averaging 38 combined city hwy mph and a whopping 41 mpg on the highway | No more filling up at 102 a pop | This car sips | We love the ride and there is plenty of room for the kids in the back | Only downfall is that darn arm rest a driver and passenger one would be nice | Other than that this is a great car for the money and we highly recommend it | Can't wait to drive it in the snow |

 "words": With gas at 4 a gallon I researched several higher-mileage cars including the Toyota Yaris Nissan Versa Honda Fit and the Scion XD | I chose the Scion even though it didn't have the highest MPG ratings but it did come with far more standard amenities and just as many safety features as the others | To add all of the standard XD features to the Yaris Versa or Fit and you'd bump their prices higher than the base XD | In addition to the great mileage I'm averaging about 33 MPG in mixed- conditions driving 50 miles a day it has 128 HP which gets me in and out of traffic quickly | I'm 5'11 200 lbs and there's plenty of head leg and hip room | I highly recommend the XD |

 "words": After test driving the Yaris and Honda Fit the peppy engine higher seating amazing standard safety features and overall appearance sold me on the xD | My only real complaint is the road noise but that's of pretty minor importance to me | It's a tight little precise ride and the manufacturing tolerances are really impressive | Everything feels like quality on the Scion unlike with the Ford Focus that it's replacing | I also love the firmness of the seats | The toggle feature on the l | e | d | odometer which allows you to see your mpg at any current moment is really nifty although I'm a little suspicious of the accuracy of such a device | At any rate this is an exciting little car |

 "words": I have had this XD since the beginning of April | I love this car | I have the 5 speed trans and I am averaging between 37 and 39 | 1 mile per gallon | The sound sys is great the 1 | 8 engine is the same as the corolla and the body style is original | I have driven a number of Toyota's rav4 corolla camry and I still like to drive the XD over the others | I highly recommend this car | 
 "words": We looked at the Pontiac Vibe and a Kia this car was the most bang for the buck | We got it at the TMV there was no negotiating | Standard features on the Scion were extras on the other cars we looked at | It drives like a big car every time I get out of it I look at it and can't believe how small it is | The Pioneer stereo cd are great | Can't go wrong with Toyota | 42 mpg highway so far | 
 "words": I had a Toyota Yaris for about two years and finally one day decided to turn it in and have never been happier | I got a silver automatic Xd with a few upgrades | The minute I test drove it I knew I had to have one | I like Toyota but the handling isn't as sturdy as a Scion | Even the case the owners manual is more classy than Toyota's | I am only 20 and it's great to know that I can get such an excellent car for a price that I can afford | Also being an environmentally conscious consumer this vehicle allows me to be green and have a sense of style | Excellent job Scion | 
 "words": After considering other cars such as the Ford Escape the Toyota Yaris etc | We purchased this car about a week ago | I love it | It runs smooth and the added alloy wheels make it look great | I love the electronics | It gets great gas mileage | 
 "words": We just purchased this car after looking at many looking for the best mileage | We are both happy | Missing arm rest hope this can get passed on an a little more compartments for storage but I am sure hoping great on gas and all the great safety features | Thanks again proud owners Matt Bea Cooper
 "words": Just got the car almost a month ago and so far so good | Gas mileage is amazing although I find interior space and legroom a little small | But it's not bad considering I'm a big fella | I understand that I had to give up some of the spaciousness of my prior car 98 jeep g | c to enjoy the superb mileage | Handling seems a little mushy around corners on the highway and I think eventually I'll add the TRD rear sway bar which is supposed to improve handling tremendously | The car is very versatile with the folding reclining rear seats and is perfect for a car seat | Easy to get the kids in and out | A fit driver told me he wishes he got the xd since the Fit can barely get out of it's own way | 
 "words": I had been driving a Honda Civic hatchback for the last 10 years before buying this car | I chose the xD after doing research on current small cars | This car surprised me in a few ways 1 the high value-to- cost ratio 2 the very different look of the car pleasing to me 3 the excellent gas mileage ratings and 4 the obvious commitment by Toyota to getting it right | I might have purchased an xA if it had been available this year but not after driving the xD | I think Toyota has gotten it right with this package | My wife was enthusiastic enough to purchase an xB the following month | 
 "words": Bought this car after researching most of the models in this size | Three things sold me 1 Long list of standard features 2 It is a Toyota 3 Great looking | The only option that I purchased was the floor-mats | So far I am getting 30 mpg back and forth to work and 39 mpg on trips | My family of four takes this car everywhere | There is plenty of leg room all around and it is very comfortable to drive and ride in | We are actually considering replacing my wife's car with an xD | We also like that it feels a bit like driving a sports car | The dealer experience was great with Scion's Pure Price | Finally seeing other xDs on the road but now I am not quite as unique | 
 "words": I initially went to dealership and was interested in a Corolla | I test drove the Scion and was immediately hooked | It handles like a dream | and it's a good looking car | I filled up my tank this weekend with only 27 and it was almost on empty before that | I would buy it ALL OVER AGAIN without hesitation | 
 "words": I have enjoyed driving this car | I had a noise in the front left tire when doing U turns which caused some feathering on the tire | The dealership looked at and said there was no problem and rotated the tires | I haven't had the problem since | 
 "words": After much consideration relying heavily on consumer reviews and expert opinions I chose to buy a Scion xD | It took me almost 3 months of research and test drives to make up my mind but I am very glad I bought the Scion | I would buy it again without a second's hesitation | Other people are finally catching on because I have seen two other xD's in the last few weeks | 
 "words": Love the car | Traded in my 05 Nissan Crew Cab | Don't miss it at all | The xD is way more fun to drive | Plenty of room and so easy to park | Went with the Navigation system and 18 black wheels | Tinted the windows too | Only wish I added the performance stuff | Oh well it will happen down the road | 
 "words": Initially at the dealership I was looking at the new Corolla XRS but then as I was looking through the lot I saw the xD | Went and took it out for a test drive and was amazed at the power it put out for being a 1 | 8L | I was also amazed at the leg room that it had because I read reviews saying it was small for those with long legs | At 6ft tall I had plenty of room and I haven't even pushed it back all the way | Overall with options and everything no other car can compete | Did I mentioned it came with a first aid kit lol | 
 "words": I am the 2nd in my family to buy the Scion xD3rd to buy a Scion | My parents got their white xD in January I have a Salsa Red xD and my brother has a 2008 Scion xB their second one | We are a Scion Family and loving every minute of it | Scion's are The Best | This is also the very first time I have ever owned a brand new car | I couldn't have chosen a better car | 
 "words": I was debating between this car and the Honda fit but I am so glad that I chose this one | It's much more stylish than the Fit has the great option of vehicle stability control | And the safety features were a big seller for me as I plan to have children in the next few years | Overall this car is even better than I expected | It handles extremely well and is quite fun to drive | The radio CD iPOD controls on the steering wheel makes it easy to listen to the music you want | There is a lot of room in this little vehicle and the engine has quite a bit of pick-up | Toyota did a fabulous job in making this vehicle | 
 "words": I traded in my 2006 Volvo XC90 for the 2008 Scion xD for the gas savings | I get nearly double the gas mileage now | I still use a rear-facing car seat for my baby and it actually fits better in the back seat of the Scion than it did in the Volvo | I think it has as much to do with the shape of the dashboard as it does with the roominess of the back seat but whatever the reason the front passenger is always glad not have knees jammed up against the dashboard | Because the xD is tall with a high seating position downsizing from an SUV was not nearly the adjustment I thought it would be |
