REVIEWS
 "words": Finally purchased the best BigBoy toy available | The Duramax 2500 LTZ is the best of both work and play | Makes light work of pulling my horses | The leather loaded Escalade like interior makes an A ride | 
 "words": I upgraded from a 2003 Chevy 1500 Z71 package | I'm towing a lot more now and I needed something with a little more umph | This truck has it | I thought about the diesel for this truck but I opted for the 6 | 0 because you never know when the prices are going to sky rocket again | 
 "words": I have had my Silverado for over a year now with no problems to report | The Duramax Allison is an absolutely amazing combination leaves the competition in the dust | My only complaint was the small wheels and tires from the factory | Overall an excellent built truck period | 
 "words": This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever owned | The interior started rattling after 2500 miles | The chrome on the grill peeled after one winter in Montana | The new exhaust system is a joke | I had this truck in the dealership eight times in the first six months of which two required towing it there | The tranny fails to shift out of 5th gear after busting through heavy snow drifts | Off road traction is terrible this truck won't drive through 3 inches of snow without putting it in 4wd | Fuel economy is decent when it's empty | It gets 14 to 18mpg at 75mph | A light 16ft interstate cargo trailer will bring that down to about 9mpg | My truck is for sale and you couldn't give me another one
 "words": Got the 6 | 6 Duramax diesel with the Alison 6 speed | Rated 1 for 08 | Tows like a champ Plenty of power | LT2 package rear differential locker Bose speaker package OnStar XM radio | I added a spray in bedliner and sliding 5th hitch too | My opinion is that Chevy is far superior to Dodge Cummins 5 | 9L | Go get one | 
 "words": The Duramax is quiet smooth and powerful | 0-60 times that will make most cars see your tail lights | The interior of the LTZ is all luxury void of squeaks and rattles on the roughest roads | The Bose 6 disk is very impressive for a factory system using a center placed subwoofer and 6 speakers | Smoother stronger and better mileage than the 6 | 0L 2005 2500HD it replaced | 
 "words": Got the 6 | 6 Duramax with the Alison 6 speed only way to go | Did my Consumer review research and found Chevy diesel rated the best all round of the Big 3 for 08' | Can't even complain about the mileage | Adverage of 18 mpg 21 mpg at 55-60 crusing the interstate unloaded | Love how the Alison tranny grabs hold of the engine when the tow mode is turned on and sounds awesome | I got he 17 rims with my truck which I highly recommend | 
 "words": Ok I have had this truck for a week and I love it | I traded in my 07 1500 LS Crew Cab with a 4 | 8L because it didn't tow my trailer as good as I wanted | After dirving this truck for a week it flat out performs my 07 in every aspect | You can feel the power difference in the 08 | Gas mileage has been good for me as well | I averaged 18 | 3 on the highway last night going 75-80 for 300 miles round trip | I guess with some mods it should get better | Not a fan of the smaller looking tires on this truck | As big as this truck is you would expect tires that fill the wheel wells | Again this is an excellent truck all around Great job GM | 
 "words": This is my 6th Duramax and still have the 5th and I love the new interior design with Nav and DVD players | Sunroof definitely better too | My only complaint is the new emmissions equipment really chokes this thing and kills mileage | I get 14 in town and 18 highway with some modifications | For those wanting a better ride try a front leveling kit with longer shocks | it helps tremendously | Also try a cold air intake and bigger exhaust | helped my mileage alot | 
 "words": This is my first deisel and I love it | This thing tows my toy hauler trailer like it's not even there | I have had no issues at all and I have 4K miles on it | I get 12- 13mpg towing and 15-16mpg not | My brother has the Dodge and I feel that the motor in the Chevy feels much more refined | 
 "words": I have always been a Ford guy but when shopping for the F250 versus Silverado 2500 I thought the Chevy had a better ride a nicer interior a the dealer was very aggressive in terms of pricing | Mileage has been OK so far well within my expectations | Also very pleased with the looks of the truck | 
 "words": I've been studying diesels for a few years now | Wanted one in a 2005 Liberty wife at the time didn't | Finally bought what I wanted after the divorce | Went from two vehicles to one so this is a daily driver and the only viable daily driver amongst the big three IMO | I get 14 mpg city A C on with lots of idling and sitting at lights 19 | 5 highway 70 to 75 mph | Not bad for a vehicle that weighs this much and can tow 15400 lbs | Can't imagine feeding the old gas big block | Ride is a little rough on bad roads because of the heavy duty nature | I'm researching how to change that airbags different springs shocks | With a load it's perfect | 
 "words": Have an '08 2500HD | It's a good truck but I have already broke down first time I towed my RV 6000 lbs | Fuel mileage is terrible | 13 -15 mpg | When I tow this little RV mileage drops to 8-9 mpg | My father's '05 is twice as good on fuel with a load 15-17 mpg | They really missed the boat with this new emmissions package | Knowing what I know now I would not have bought this truck | 
 "words": I started off by driving the Dodge and Ford | Wasn't impressed | The second I sat in this thing I could tell this was a different truck | After 5 minutes of driving I was sold | Everyone complaining about the gas mileage it's a 3 4 ton truck | What do you expect | Its not a Prius | 15-16 mpgs stock is not bad | A few cheap mods and Im pulling off 20 mpgs and better |

 "words": I love my new diesel | Plenty of power no need for aftermarket chips | Rides great | Looks great | Pulls great but the fuel mileage is terrible | 13 mpg is the best I get | It has been four months now | I have 15000 miles on it and cannot get any better mileage | With the price of fuel 4 | 15 it hurts when you pull up to the pump 
 "words": Duramax w Ali Tranny very good value | Sticker 44 | 8k Paid 35 | 3k | Very nice ride itty bitty tires though 16 | that I'm gonna replace | Fuel economy on new diesels flat out stinks no reason it should be that low | Love the interior plenty of room | Well designed for towing and work | 
 "words": GM quality is going up while Toyota is going down | This truck is used as a family truck camper trailer towing and snow plowing my drive | I guess the previous poster did not have his truck set up correctly for snow plowing | You should have ordered the aux | battery and larger alternator | That's what those options are specifically for | I have a HD plow it it works fine | 
 "words": Have an on going problem when trying to plow with this truck | It loses amperage so bad I can not pick the plow up until I shut the truck off and wait a bit before restarting | They put on a new voltage regulatornew computer etc | When the mechanic called the GM rep and discussed this with him he said there was nothing wrong | I make a living with my truck and have had 12 Chevys over the years with no problemsthis is ridiculous | I feel I am being pushed aside because they dont know whats wrong yet |

 "words": This is a beautiful truck | The style has really grown on me since it first came out it looks great with after market wheels and tires | It has a good ride and is comfortable to drive | The back up sensors are nice with a big truck like this | The power is much less noticeable than my 2006 with the LBZ | It has been in the shop 4 times and was in there for over a month the last time | I may sell this one and keep my 06 | All new diesels seam to have exhaust problems | You may be better off to purchase a pre January 1 diesel to avoid problems until all of the issues are resolved |
