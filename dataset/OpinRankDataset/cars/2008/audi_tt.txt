REVIEWS
 "words": It's been a year now and I still love this car | I did have a problem with the top locking up | Now there is a recall for that parts | I'm over 6 feet but I sit comfortably in this convertible | Kicking myself for not purchasing the Audi Care Service for 740 in IL | Maybe they will let me buy it before the 15k service | Love the paddle shifters | Hate the Ipod interface | I have to guess at the playlist album artists | My wife used regular unleaded against my wishes and it has not affected my 28mpg | Where can I get some track time and properly learn how to push this car to its limits | 
 "words": My previous cars were a 2005 Lotus Elise and a 2000 Boxster S before that | I need a 4 seater for my baby son and the TT was the only car that really interested me short of a 911 | Comparatively the TT is very capable in the real world | Its handling is decent however the steering a bit light and there's too much understeer in the canyons | Acceleration is decent and brake is excellent | Storage is adequate | It's a good daily driver car | I did compare payment to a similar spec VW GTi no interest in it but just doing due diligence and the TT is about 125 more a month so it's not a bad deal | 
 "words": Got this 3 | 2 coupe used and am loving it | Handles like a dream and the dual clutch tranny is by far the best feature | Would buy a 4 cylinder if buying new but wanted to Quattro and saved | 08 3 | 2 was my only option for Quattro given used and value | As for gas mileage averaging about 22 and am happy with it | It hard to compare the gas mileage in my mind when this thing wants to run well above the speed limit | If you want to push it off the line every time then the numbers will drop and yes so will they in any car | I'm very impressed with the style throughout and cannot get over the attention to detail in the beauty | 
 "words": Perfect in every way | Love the headlights tail lights interior exterior and 10 spoke bicolor rims that stand out | 
 "words": I have been driving my 1995 Audi 90 for over 13 years when I upgraded to a slightly used 2008 Audi TT | Wow what a difference a decade makes | I am amazed at the power of the 2 | 0T along with the smoothnessof the whole vehicle | I've owned Audi's for over 25 years so I am a fan but of course there are some things that could be improved | 
 "words": Three years ago after having three TTs I traded the last one for an A3 | But when the redesigned TT model came out I couldn't resist | The 2008 coupe 3 | 2 quattro with S-tronic is a step above the previous models in every respect power handling styling sophistication fun | I especially like the smoothness of the S-tronic which hesitated quite a bit in the last two cars I had | The larger interior is just enough to make friends say it no longer feels cramped | 
 "words": This is a nice little car | Convenient as the size allows easy parking everywhere | Gas mileage is acceptable not as good as the 2 | 0 version | Interior is outstanding enhanced leather interior the rear seats work well with my 2 children ages 9 and 6 for short rides | The suspension feels a little harsh I don't have magnetic suspension which might be a deal breaker for some | However no car is perfect and this one is not the exception | 
 "words": What can I say | It's summer time and I like to drive with my top off | I still need to get used to it since I only drove it for a week | It's a head turner for sure | I couldn't do that with my old car so I am pretty happy with it | I have yet to test the S drive and the S tronic though but the D drive has been exciting so far 
 "words": Bought this for my wife she needed one last sports car before we she got old | She had an old 1976 Porsche 911 but loves this car better in fact she's says the TT is her best car ever | Bought a red color coupe and she loves it | It's perfect for her petite size and I know she loves getting all the attention | The handling is great it wants to be driven and before she knows it the spolier pops up and she notices that she's going 80 miles plus | The trunk is big enough for a weekend trip | I'm just a bit too big for the seat which is too confining for me on a long drive but it's a her car and she loves it | When Mama's happy everybody's happy | 
 "words": This car is amazing | Style performance and quality are all 10 | The 4cyl turbo is great plenty of kick to it | Peformance and economy my last fill up was averaged at 30mpg | I was hesitant to purchase an automatic what's the fun of a sports car that you can't shift | However the paddle shifters are a lot of fun and make up for a spouse that can't drive stick | The top drops smooth and speedy | Nice to be able to put it up or down when moving | The launch control feature is a blast | It will light the tires up like it had 400 horses under the hood | Great in the snow as FWD only | 
 "words": I love to drive this car | I had a car that got better gas mileage and just couldn't give up driving this fun sports car | Too early really to tell about reliability | With numerous frost heave speedbumps and potholes around here I started hearing a knocking noise in the front end when going over a bump | The dealership however didn't hear it | Of course I'm still under warranty | They also told me that the 2 bent rims are slight although I have a tire rim warranty | The rear tires are worn out at around 17000 miles | They stick like glue to the road however | Would I buy this car again | You bet | 
 "words": I won a 08 TT coupe in Bixoli MS at the Grand Casino and traded it for a Roadster with 47 miles on it at the dealer | I have had 6 convertibles before this and never an Audi 3 MGs 1 Mustang 1 LeSabre 1 Miata | This baby takes the cake it is smooth and agressive at the same time | I just love this car | It is a real eye turner also | Drives well in the city and runs like a scalded dog when you put your foot into it on the interstate | I love when the automatic spooler goes up at 75mph you can manually do it also in town and people point at you with amazement as you pass | 
 "words": Really wonderful except the gas mileage | After having owned three 225hp TT Roadster before I have to admit I really like the sound of the engine | Compared to the 225hp experiences before however this 6cyl consumes considerably more fuel hwy 25 vs hwy 29 | Obviously the first TT almost made me a die-hard TT fan but there have been considerable improvements to the new generation such as a larger trunk no lie it can manage two gold bags a better top great GPS and customizable computer | Needless to say that I just love the design | All wheel makes it a safer ride even under challenging circumstances | 
 "words": This car is simply a blast to drive | I have the basic 4cyl turbo model and it flies | Car is built to be driven hard | I have a stop and go and highway commute and its is happy doing both | It is tight and responsive and loves to be pushed | Driving this car will actually make you smile every single time you get in | You will find yourself looking for reasons to go for a drive | Everyone will look at you in this car simply b c there are so few out there on the road | Truly a fun car to own and pleasure to drive
 "words": My second Audi TT is red | It is a great looking car | The top has broken and gets stuck down | This has happened twice in one month | It was fixed and only lasted a few weeks | Also the passenger window doesn't lay flush with the door after several repair attempts | It looks better with the window not sticking up a little | I could use some help with this | Obviously I loved the TT enough to lease another one | I was hoping it would work well like the 2004 TT I leased for 4 happy years | 
 "words": I first saw the Audi TT on the road and immediately started to do my research | After attending the Chicago auto show I was sold on the TT and had to have one I now own a 3 | 2L 6 speed manual and can desribe this vehicle in one word powerful | Driving this car is truly an experience and we cannot wait to take it for a long drive | The car handles so well that I can drive 90 mph and not feel any vibration | If you are thinking of buying this vehicle stop thinking and buy | You will love it | 
 "words": My new Audi replaces a 2002 TT 225 Quattro 6 speed manual | I almost expect to have minor electrical and mechanical issues but it's a compromise when driving this great road going car | The new TT has only a few hundred miles but it is easy to see and feel the differences | It is a better appointed interior and the DSG has become very smooth in its delivery | The gusty exhaust note is what I listen to most when I drive though the basic factory stereo sounds great | Bought the car for Quattro and when I had a FWD A3 for loaner it was apparent I made the right decision | I'll check back after I get through the self imposed 5k mile keep the RPM under 3500 break-in period | Easier said than done
 "words": Had my TT for 1 week and loving it | Fully loaded excl | nav and mag | ride | Was considering an '04 '05 but then saw the '08 and it was all over | I test drove the 2 | 0 but decided on the 3 | 2 due to power and Quattro I expect to keep this car for a long time | 
 "words": Bought the TT after having an Audi Cab for many years | Loved the car at first sight and had to have it | It has never disappointed me | Handles in snow and ice without any difficulties or worries | 
 "words": I have had this car for 8 months and I still get all giddy when I see it | I feel that the seats fit my body so well that when I sit down in them my happy tt is giving me a hug | Its fast its sexy and handles well | I have never felt that the car has put me in danger and I love how noisy the exhaust is but its not an annoying noise like from some modified cars | I feel bad for people who have chosen to buy other cars in its class | 
 "words": I have had some problems with my AUTOMATIC transmission | When I am stopped on a hill and then try to go the car rolls backward like I have a manual transmission | There does not seem to be a hill-holder feature | What is maddening is that this only happens occasionally | I must put my foot on the brake AND gas to keep from hitting the car behind me | When I reported the problem to the dealership they said it was a normal characteristic of the car | Also the car rolls backward an inch or so when I put it in park on a hill | The transmission seems loose or sloppy | My dealership can find nothing wrong | I can't believe this is a NORMAL characteristic of the car | 
 "words": I am a previous 2003 TT roadster owner and I was very happy with this car | However the improvements of the 2008 made it a car I had to have | I was reluctant to give up my turbo to the v6 but I have to say I have not missed it much | This car still has quick pickup and speed whenever I need it | I love the optional navigation ipod interface and bluetooth | I also love the manageability of the cars computer view on the console | I shopped for many months before purchasing a new car and it came down to the Z06 and the TT | Yeah some V8 corvette lover is laughing at me right now but bang for the buck I got the better car | I have been an owner of both cars and in the end best car won | 
 "words": Nothing but fun to drive for me with the Stronic gear box and my wife can still drive it like an auto | 
 "words": My first Audi | I love it | The styling blows me away everytime I go to drive | I can't believe that the best car in any parking lot is my mine | Loads of room in the front and the trunk | The rear seats are good for shopping or our medium sized dog | Even if I'm stuck in traffic I can enjoy the elegance of this car until that is there is an opportunity to use all the power exhilarating | 2 optional suspension modes sport regular and 4 transmission choices auto sport paddle override and clutchless manual great combinations | The quattro AWD drive is superb in the snow | I am hoping reliability is good but I've only had it 3 months | As an only car for a kid free couple it's fantastic
 "words": I have only had the car for less than a month but love it | I traded an 03 Audi TT which I thought was a great car but it pales in comparison to the new one | Extremely fun to drive but be careful I just got my first speeding ticket in 10 years with it | Very tight responsive and roomy for a 2 seater | Bluetooth has not worked properly since I bought it and am taking it back to service again next week | The bluetooth receives very clearly but transmission is broken up to the point the other person can barely understand what I am saying | 
 "words": Wait let me wipe the silly grin off my face | How much fun can you have in a car | Design build performance are all first rate | First Audi I have owned and I am impressed | It's quick nimble but comfortable and accomodating | The interior looks and feels so much better than the Mercedes and BMW we test drove forego the standard Alcantara upholstery the Napa leather upgrades are worth the extra money | It turns heads wherever it goes | 
 "words": Just got the 08 TT roadster convertible Sahara Silver with Baseball Glove leather interior and mag ride | I am amazed at how fun the car is to drive being my first convertible first german car ever and with cornering acceleration that is way fun | I cannot imagine springing for the 3 | 2 when my turbo 4 cyl is as much fun as I'd want to have | I'm not dragging it at the track or anything | The clincher is that the color and style is out of this world beautiful | I believe it's an instant classic | I'm hoping it's sufficiently reliable though as a 4th car parked except for weekends and special occasions I'm willing to tolerate some compromises and shop time for its charms | 
 "words": Took delivery in late July after ordering the 1st of May | Could not be happier | My last convertible was 17 years ago a Silver Buick Reatta | Reatta needed more power and was much heavier than the TT and had vague steering compared to razor sharp feel now | I flashed the chip with APR software and the car moves very responsively and smoothly | Also replaced the fogs with PIAA HIDs and put in bright amber DRLs | I plan to install an air intake system and rework the exhaust in the near future | The car will be a project with mods installed as they come to market | I may even put in a higher- performance turbo in the future with nitrous being considered | 
 "words": This is my first European car and so far it has exceeded my high expectations | The styling is beautiful the ride is comfortable and solid it's very zippy very nimble steering is very comfortable fuel economy is great even if you like to accelerate quickly | The interior is composed of high quality materials and a soothing variety of textures and finishes | The controls are all at your fingertips and easy to operate | It also has very decent cargo capacity that is actually accessible | I could go on but suffice it to say it's a truly exceptional experience to drive | 
 "words": I've had the new Audi TT Roadster for around 2 weeks and it is by far the best car I have ever owned | I've had the Z4 and the 2006 Boxster and none of the come even close to the 2008 TT Roadster | Everything about this car is flawless | 
 "words": I have only had the car for 2 days but I am in love | After test driving several the Infiniti G35X Acura TL Type S BMW 328xi I was set to buy the TL-S when I stopped by my Audi dealer | When I saw the new 2008 TT coupe I stopped dead in my tracks I don't think there is a better looking car on the road | I drove both the 3 | 2 Quattro and 2 | 0T and while the former has a little extra punch and impeccable handling the 2 | 0T was plenty strong and nimble | And it fit my wallet better | I have a hard time finding any faults with the TT but even a harder time wiping the smile off my face when driving it | I truly think this car is a good value compared to the competition | 
 "words": I drove this car today at work and I have to say it's the best car I have ever driven in my life | It's really solid stable in the corners pretty good ride for a sports car with performance tires | The exterior design is exceptional | Plenty of interior room for me being 6'1
