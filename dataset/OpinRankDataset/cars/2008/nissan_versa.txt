REVIEWS
 "words": I have a 2008 Versa Hatchback and this is an awesome ride | it has been a year now owning it and had 50000 miles on it | to this day I have only taken it in for minor sunroof issues and had my car stereo replaced 2 times now | Handles great but when the wind comes blowing by Man does that car pull to the sides | I really don't think its getting 30 MPG | i would say it's more like 25- 29 MPG's | the sound system in it needs to be a lot better than what it has now | my mother has a dakota and the sound system is Great | If its a sport package and needs a better sound system | Other than that it is a great car to drive and my car for traveling | 
 "words": I was in a car crash in 2007 with another type of vehicle | I was very concerned about replacing my vehicle | I had to have a safe vehicle with airbags and a proven safety record | My Versa met every requirement that I needed and believe me I spent many hours reading reviews and also looking at all types of vehicles | The Versa had everything I needed and was at a great price | The dealership that I bought from was friendly and they were very patient with me answered all my questions and realized how much safety was important to me | I love my vehicle and have recommended the Versa to others without hesitation | 
 "words": My first car was a 1985 Nissan Maxima and I ran it to death from the years of 2003-2008 when I bought our Versa | Since then we have had the fuel pump replaced THREE TIMES and it keeps failing | We recently had it replaced but notified Nissan of us declaring lemon when the part breaks again I just hope I get all the money I put into it as we are a few hundred dollars off from paying the entire 16k we paid for it | 
 "words": Everything is great on the vehicle except the starting problems | has difficulty starting it takes 2 cranks sometimes not only in winter but in all seasons | It has been in the dealership 5 times in the first 12 months I bought it | Nissan Corporation refuses to buy back the vehicle because the dealership I bought it from keeps on replacing different parts the dealership also don't report this to CARFAX either bad dealership | I am now going to take it to a different Nissan dealership and see what their mechanic says | Nissan has made me miss 5 days of work not good | I have a manual and I am lucky if I get 27 mpg in the city I don't drive it hard | 
 "words": I expected more from a nissan | It has been in the shop over 5 times in the first year to fix missing interior part mysterious cluck in the front steering air conditioning problem and hard to start at first until a part was replaced | All covered by warranty but that runs out soon and I can't wait to find out what breaks next | I would have rated it lower but my wife is too nice | 
 "words": I did my research and discounted the Fit Yaris etc in favour of the Versa bc of horsepower room and the Nissan reputation | It exceeded all my expectations at first fun to drive reliable good fuel economy easy to handle | Then winter hit | In cold wet weather I would come out to the car and find ice all over the dash controls and inside of the windows and windshields | The controls wouldn't work and the doors wouldn't shut | Warming it up no change | Getting it fixed at the dealer proved extremely problematic ie | didn't happen cost to me to fix was quoted at 5-10K | I just traded it in for a 2009 model hoping for better this time around | It'll likely be my last Nissan too | 
 "words": We are looking for a good commuter car and big inside | I don't wanted to buy a SUV a big gas hug | I need a car that good in gas and roomy inside and big trunk | Specially with two kids | We found this Nissan Versa I told my husband its very comforting and very roomy inside | We test drive after that we bought the car and I love driving it | 
 "words": This car is junk | In less than four months my brakes failed | I took to the dealership over and over | Was told nothing was wrong | Last time they kept my car 4 days and did nothing to it | Next day the brakes failed | Very noisy with lots of rattles and squeaks | Windows squeak constantly and never have gotten more than 33 mpg on the hwy | Tire pressure light goes on and off for no reason | Poor handling in tight turns and a popping when turning tightly to the left | I will never buy a Nissan again in my life | I even talked to the Corporate office and was told to take my car to a different dealership to have the brakes looked at and was charged | Had to take car to personal mechanic | 
 "words": I am very satisfied with this car | After 30000 miles I have had no problems and gas mileage has been averaging 34 | 3mpg | I drive mostly in the mountains and small towns | The cvt transmission is the best automatic that I have driven in the mountains | The holdback saves on the brakes and there is no shifting as I navigate these winding mountain roads | The antilock braking system works great in ice and snow | 
 "words": We went looking for a small reliable car with a c with a strong preference for a hatchback | We focused on the usual suspects Honda Fit Toyota Yaris Scion whatever Toyota Matrix Pontiac Vibe | Then we saw the Versa at a Hertz sales lot liked it researched it and could buy it for 3000 under KBB | Negatives are rear visibility and stability in cross winds | A big positive is roominess whether carrying four people or two people and two bicycles they fit in all the way without having to take off a wheel | When we bought we would have preferred a Matrix if the money was close to the same | That would have been a mistake | 
 "words": When I first saw this car I loved the way it looked | After purchasing the car I love the size of it how I fit in small spaces and the way it revs up when you put your foot on the accelerator | It looks smaller outside than it is inside | Also I have a brother in law who is at least 6'4 and he had plenty of room in the back seat | I am a woman of 5'9 and I am so comfortable | 
 "words": This car is just OK but not comfortable at all | Very small trunk can't fit a small suitcase | Very hard to take anything out of the trunk | Heating does not work well | 
 "words": I have 3 teenage drivers and this car is perfect for them and me too | I also like the fact that it is a humble car | No flash no fuss | Those of us who bought them know we would have spent a lot more on the Corolla Civic Fit etc and had a lot less interior room | 
 "words": The Versa is an economy car in first class cladding | The Versa has more than other cars in its class larger tires 15 larger interior space feels bigger than it is and good gas mileage | Some say the car is breezy I don't find it breezy at all | I drive 90 miles each way on my once-a- week commute and find the car solid and comfortable on the interstate | The seats are large and solid and nicely upholstered | Interior looks expensive like a Maxima way better than our Echo's plasto box interior | Exterior has that funky European styling that we just don't get over here in North America | Engine is capable a bit buzzy but with the CVT it settles down once up to speed | 
 "words": I've had the car a week now and have put 1200 miles on it | It's getting between 30 to 32 mpg with a regular auto trans | I think it will get more when I do my first oil change and switch to Mobil 1 synthetic | The car is quite roomy on the inside and more comfortable than a 2007 Corolla which I had looked at and rented thru a car rental agency | 
 "words": Good around town runabout | Performance is good for this class of car | The 4 speed auto is to be desired | Lots of foot well space for my size 13s to shift a manual if I had gotten it | The wife cannot drive stick so auto it is | Not much room for groceries but it does the job for a younger couple starting out | Over 4000rpm the engine gets obnoxious but cruises great in top gear at 2450rpm 60mph | Very quiet inside not much wind noise etc | It's a bit sloppy on the road in high winds but descent in the snow | Why is there no temperature gauge | Come on Nissan | Alternator and most major parts are easily replaceable under the hood for those who plan to own for a long time | 
 "words": Haven't had my Versa for very long but I have not complaints so far | It handles well fuel economy is great and its a very good looking car | My car is a 2008 Nissan Versa S hatchback 6 speed manual | The price and look brought me to this car and I am happy I found it | 
 "words": After copious research I narrowed it down to Honda Fit or Versa better dealer financing swung it in favor of the Versa | After a month though I'm a little hesitant to recommend this little hatchback | Gas mileage has been OK but not great we've got 21s to 29 depending on how much highway driving we do this is the CVT model | Driving comfort is the big problem lumbar support is non-existent seats are short and no support under thighs | Steering wheel is too far away if you're not ridiculously short | Ride is OK but blows around like a leaf in the wind and doesn't feel well connected to the road easily drifts | That said it turned out to be excellent in snow easy to control and stop | 
 "words": I test drove the Yaris Fit Focus and the Scion xD | The Versa was not the best driving car too much oversteer on turns felt top heavy and uneven braking but I felt it was the best value | My 2002 Focus SE handles much better and gets about the same 30-34 MPG | The 1 | 8L CVT has better acceleration than my 2 | 2L Focus but is noisy at higher RPMs | What sold me on the Versa was its upscale stock interior styling and the roomy back seat | I found only 2 manufacturing defects a squeak coming from the dash and the chrome plating on the front Nissan emblem peeling dealer replaced | Not bad compared to the many defects I found in my Ford Focus when purchased new | 
 "words": I am replacing a 2002 Nissan Sentra which I LOVED and after test driving several competitors I came back to Nissan | I also drove the mid-level Sentra and the Versa has a much better interior layout | LOVE my bluetooth phone and intelligent key | As a small business owner this feature is a lifesaver and worth every cent | The ABS upgrade has also paid for itself with a 300 per six months savings on my car insurance over the old Sentra | Car is peppy and ROOMY | almost like the fabled Tardis | way bigger inside than it looks | I plan to drive this car for 10 years and think it will be a happy love affair | 
 "words": Only had my 6M hatchback for a month but have already put over 3000 miles on it went to N | Arizona for Christmas 83 one way | Handled very well on the snow and ice very impressed with the quietness in fact just yesterday a passenger in my car didn't believe the engine was still running 'til I pulled away | Half a tank of gas will see me over 200 miles driv to work is 30 miles highway 15 miles city | Fun to drive responsive and spacious after driving a V8 truck for years didn't expect to like it that much outstanding value for money | 
 "words": We love our new Nissan | We're getting 38 miles to the gallon | On our 07 we got 40 mpg and we haven't even broken this one in yet | What a differance color really does make | The 07 was black didn't have all the amenities that my husband wanted so we traded it in for an 08 | This one is white just what he wanted with the sunroof xm radio and all the additional pkgs | you can get | Life is too short might as well get what he really wants | For a big-little car for running around it the greatest we found it so comfortable we use it for road trips too | 
 "words": I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the seats are and the roominess of my Versa as well as how well it rides and responds to my foot | The car rides and responds like a much bigger car | They could have placed the side mirror controls in a better location so that you do not have to bend and reach to make adjustments | Other than that my wife and I really enjoy driving this car | 
 "words": Test drove the CVT my 6 speed is much more responsive and quiet | Fuel economy is great at 32 city-35 hwy | Drove a lot in Denver recently- consistent 32 mpg | Very happy with the options chosen with the S cruise power package and equally happy with the price | Test drove Corolla and Civic | The Versa and the options I wanted would have cost me much more in the other more well known models | Insurance is also cheaper | The Versa is much more comfortable and fun to drive | Wish there was an arm rest | small price to pay | A lot of space in such a small sedan | Handles well on ice and snow | Great car | 
 "words": After 3 months I continue to be very happy with the Versa | I enjoy the extras MP3 plug-in etc | but the basics of the car are great ie automatic tire pressure warning | I get 25-30 mpg depending if I have been using the AC | No problems driving in the recent snow | It's no sportscar but I definitely notice good pick-up off the lights compared to almost all other sedans on the road | Overall a great value | 
 "words": After owning my fair share of Honda Civics I decided it was time for a change | I wanted something that was good on gas and comfortable at a price that wouldn't break the bank | I test drove a Mazda3 Ford Focus Hyundai Elantra before settling on the Versa | I'm 100 satisfied with my decision | While an economy car the Versa SL doesn't lack in quality | The quality of the interior fabric is superb | It's easy to clean durable | All controls are placed logically are easily accessible | The CVT is smooth and quiet | Love it | 
 "words": TPMS replaced new computer for sensors | Hit door locks and occasionally the stereo cuts off | Alarm system when locking used to beep horn and flash lights now just locks checked all fuses and replaced no fix | Gas door jammed and bent from wind rushing behind it now I have to use a credit card to open sometimes | I have 25000 miles on car | It is a 6 speed and occasionally on steep grades inclines or descending the car will make rattling noises and Ill feel slight vibration in clutch | Dealer can't reproduce the problem | 
 "words": Own this for 2 months | This car has a great French ride similar to an old Renault R-10 I used to own | nice | The 6 speed shifts terrific but the gearing and clutch take a little getting used to | Seats are very comfortable | Controls for major functions are nicely laid out and instrument panel is well lit | This car rides very smooth and quiet for its class and the price can't be beat for the features | Seating room front back is MUCH larger than most compact cars | The hatch's 'trunk' is deceivingly large | I love the looks of the car except for the nose | looks like a tiny Quest van | Gas mileage in mostly stop go suburban rush hour traffic is about 28 so far | I really like it -
 "words": Having purchased the Versa three weeks ago I have to say I am impressed | Having to commute 72 mi a day I am getting 30 miles to the gallon | My vehicle now has 800 miles on it | Having a manual and owning three prior autos with manual transmission including Toyota Corolla I have to say that for the price the Versa is well worth it | The only drawback which I am getting used to is in regards to shifting | There is very little room for error in shifting from second to third as well as from fifth to fourth gear | There is plenty of headroom in the drivers seat as well as plenty of room in the rear | If you're looking for a reduced priced subcompact | I would recommend the Versa over the Corolla | 
 "words": I drove every econo box before I made a decision Fit Spectra Aveo xA Corolla Civic | none came close in interior comfort | Only those from Toyota and Honda drove as nice | That said the automatic is a little clunky I should have gotten the stick or the CV tranny | Gas mileage is very disappointing I drive all highway miles and struggle to get 28 mpgs | 
 "words": Have owned my 2008 hatchback for almost 2 months | Drives great and lots of room | I trust Nissan and know they make excellent cars | So far there are 3 undesirable issues | One is that the wheels have very cheap hub caps | One of mine came flying off while I was driving | It's a piece of junk these covers | Also the cup holders are in a horrible location | I had to install a cup tray from a conversion van on the dash in the middle | And finally do not buy this car without the power option | A huge mistake | Power locks should be standard but they are not | You will regret it w o the power package | 
 "words": The Versa S sedan manual trans with the Power Package is more than enough car for our family of young drivers | The car shifts smoothly rides nice for a small car and has much more interior leg room in the back seat than many mid size cars | The trunk space is surprisingly large too | The dash has a nice look | I believe this vehicle will gain a lot of sales momentum as it priced so competitively and has so much to offer | 
 "words": Except for its somewhat unattractive front end styling it disappears when you get yourself behind the driver's seat | Yup it's no pocket rocket but the CVT gets it up to speed sooner than you can tell Bluetooth which number you wish to dial | The ride is smooth with good road feedback | Quieter than other more expensive vehicles | I've had my share of Porsches Corvettes and everything in between | Nissan has put some serious thought into the making of this vehicle and what it has to offer | The Versa proves that an inexpensive car doesn't have to be made cheaply | With ridiculous gas prices these days I'd buy it again | 
 "words": Love the gas mileage | Plenty of room interior | Fun car | 
 "words": I love my new Versa SL | For a city car it is perfect | Fuel efficient small and comfortable x 100 | I appreciate that the cloth seats actually look really nice | I am really pleased with my purchase and feel that compared to other cars in its class price range I did really well | I also test drove Fit and Rabbit | The Versa totally felt better than those | btw had to rate reliablity for the site but i have no idea will take time | Expect a lot as my previous Nissan experiences were very positive | 
 "words": Overall a great car | Nice appearance | both the exterior and interior | The interior has a nice | futuristic | feel to it not over the top and is exceptionally spacious back seat okay for adults | Mixed fuel economy has returned an impressive 30 | 33 mpg albeit mostly highway | The CVT is wonderful | it offers seamless shifting I | ll never settle for a conventional automatic again | Ample acceleration no sports car however | Great features for an entry-level | Why buy an SUV like the Honda CR-V my wife and I traded in when you can have effectively the same interior space much better fuel economy in a less expensive package | 
 "words": We've had the car a week now and just love it | It's a lot smaller than our minivan but it gets a whole lot better gas mileage too | Our temps have been in the high 90s and 100s and I run the A C each time I drive | Barely moves the gas gauge | We love the style of the car the inside is comfy CVT is great audio system is wonderful and bluetooth is a great safety feature | I'm glad we have ABS and all the air bags too | that really saved on our car insurance | The ride is very smooth | We think it takes bumps well | All in all I'd rate this car a 9 | 5 out of 10 | 
 "words": The CVT is fun to drive and the car itself handles very well | 
 "words": Just got my Versa liked the options on the SL but got a S with same upgrades for a lot less | Great on gas | Interior is awesome | Best new car I have purchased yet | 
 "words": Right now western Canadians are paying about 1 | 10 per litre 4 | 15 per gallon for regular unleaded | I was paying about 400 | 00 per month in fuel alone driving my restored cutlass supreme | I needed something to save money fast | Apples to apples the Versa is the best quality in its class with a lot of bragging rights in the category | Love it love it love it | I thought I was going to hate a compact car because I drive a 300 hp car and a new crotch rocket but this car has a lot of pep | The 1 | 8L engine is matched beautifully to the 6 speed manual | I tried the cvt liked it but the 6 speed was way too much for an enthusiast like me to pass up | Nissan you've made a believer out of me | 
 "words": I traded in a Hyundai Santa Fe on this car back when the gas prices skyrocketed | I was told I would get 35 mpg | Not | I gave up many extras that I had on the Santa Fe heated seats leather interior etc | Not worth it | I drive 42 miles round trip to work 5 days a week and get about 28 mpg | I make a 5-6 trips from Cincy to Columbus about 200 miles and only get 29-30 mpg | This may not seem like a lot but I would have been better off with the Hyundai it was paid off | 
 "words": I bought a modestly equipped Versa as an extremely economical choice | It was the most affordable 5-door that wasn't too small but I was dissatisfied overall | A mediocre suspension poor 6-speed shifter and unsupportive seats made an unrefined ride | Mine got poorer than average MPG despite a light foot | The brakes squeaked from the first day and were never repaired to my satisfaction | Nissan even distributed a note to dealerships to excuse themselves from this problem | In other words Versas squeak | Too bad | If you want a low cost Nissan buy the Cube instead | 
 "words": I got sick of driving my BMW 325 in the snow and then got sick of fixing my Volvo so I sucked it up and bought a commuter car | I have always been a fan of Nissan reliability have had several over many years | I now drive 25k a year | I have put 34k on this car and it runs the same as the day I bought it | There was a minor vibration at 3000 RPM that was easily repaired air conditioning insulation was vibrating | I have done all the scheduled maintenance | I recommend that | I am of the mind set that if this car is maintained correctly it will last a long time | Is it fun to drive like a Euro car | NO | But it is reasonably quiet handles okay and slow as molasses | Overall I am happy |

 "words": At 4700 miles car developed oil leak | Also hard start problem | Dealer had to practically disassemble upper engine to cure oil leak | He messed up the timing and had to redo the whole thing | Apparently the engines are not quality checked at the factory or the leak would have been found | Fuel regulator was replaced to correct the hard start | I am very wary of this car now | I know something will go bad down the road | 
 "words": Recently bought my Versa SL preowned with 5000 miles on it | Prior to buying the car I drove similar cars from Toyota Hyundai Honda VW Ford | The thing that sets the Versa apart from these other cars is the super low interior noise level and seamless transmission shifting provided by the CVT | I also noticed a lower level of engine vibration or buzziness that's sometimes transmitted through the accelerator pedal or steering wheel of 4 cylinder cars | The car has a much more solid feel to it than the Ford Focus | The doors sound solid when they are closed you can tell the car is put together well | As back seats go this car has a very roomy rear seating area for a small car | Nice little car |

 "words": Purchased this Nissan Versa in April 2008 as a commuter vehicle | I have a 64 mile round trip daily commute | I have had the Versa back four time to the dealership | Once for highway mileage that is only 27 mpg | The other three times have been for roof or door leaks | All have been part of warranty coverage with free loaners to use during work | My floors are slopping wet and have been wet more than half of the eight months I have owned the vehicle | The last time I noticed wetness was after a free car wash that my dealership offers with each oil change | Living in Maine a wet vehicle means frozen interiors to your windows each morning | Wish I had not purchased this vehicle | 
 "words": I have gotten into 5 different wrecks in the past year and most if not all having to do with my blind spots on the left and right sides of the vehicle | I have noticed that the head rest cushioning has already started to come undone and also the lining to my back right window is coming undone which is letting water seep through | The biggest thing though is that just recently I found myself stranded at 3 in the morning with my car not wanting to crank | After getting it towed the mechanic informed me that it was my fuel injectors flooding my engine | He said it was a flaw due to the manufacturing and would not be surprised if I would need to do it again in 40000 miles | That job cost me 325 |

 "words": I wanted a vehicle comparable to my 2004 Pontiac Vibe which has 110000 miles and has been perfectly reliable | I also wanted a vehicle that is smoother and quieter than the Vibe which I still love despite noisy and expensive tires | The Versa fills the bill is a little more maneuverable and takes less effort to drive | Visibility is a little better too | Fuel economy is comparable Versa being better in the city and the Vibe slightly better on the highway | For me the Versa is plenty quick like the Vibe | I like the quiet the Blue Tooth the jack in the ratio that lets me use my 30 XM radio | 
 "words": Mine is an SL with the tech and sport packages i | e | every option available So far I am very impressed with my Versa | I cross-shopped this car with the Fit Rondo Yaris VW City Golf Canada-only model and even the Mazda 3 | in the end it was between this and the Fit | I chose the Versa because it had a better interior and was better value for money | So far 4000 miles nothing has gone wrong and there hasn't even been the customary mysterious new car dash squeak | It feels like I'm driving a high quality product and not an econobox | The CVT takes a bit of getting used to but it really suits this engine and doesn't feel bogged down like the 4 spd auto in my '04 Sentra |

 "words": I love my Nissan | This car drives great and has SO much head and foot room | It has plenty of cup holders and gets great gas mileage | I also love how sleek it looks on the outside | I have had some problems with it however | My starter is going out for the 2nd time I have had to have my fuel pump changed already and I am always having hubcaps fall off | about 7 so far | Thank goodness for my warranty | Other than that though I love my car | It is so relaxing and comfortable to drive | The trunk has plenty of room also | My dealership has been the best I have ever had | They have been extremely friendly and has work well with me | 
 "words": Car purchased strictly for economical driving to ranches on good highways | Cruise control very important accessory | Cruise control is the worst I have ever experienced | Resume mode is a joke | Driving on normal highways in flat South Texas is nightmare | Any little bump or slight incline causes cruise control to downshift from 2800 RPMs to 4200 RPMs | Nissan will not fix | Mileage poor because of cruise control 28-30 average |

 "words": 100 miles day and the car is great | Comfortable but the S needs a center arm rest | Very smooth ride and handles very well | Most interior room of any small car we tested Yaris Elantra Cobalt Mazda3 Corolla | I'm 6'2 and leg room was very important | This is a great buy for your money | 32 MPG when I drive reasonably 29 MPG when I keep up with Chicago traffic at 80 MPH | 
 "words": Good gas mileage 26 city 33 hwy | Wanted a manual but not available on sl sedan so I decided to try the CVT and I like it | Performance is excellent with this trans | Unfortunately it is my understanding that you cannot get the CVT in the SL sedan any longer it is only available in the hatchback | The only available trans on the SL sedan is the 4 Speed auto as such gas mileage will suffer | The Versa has ABS and 6 airbags | The bluetooth works great and the radio with XM and 6 cd offers great listening flexibility |

 "words": My wife and I were heading towards a Yaris but by the time we had all the features picked out the price was to high for our budget | We looked at the Versa and got a lot more car with the needed features | I use this little car for work and kept my truck for the big stuff like hauling trash and getting gravel | I am disappointed with the highway mpg and steering wheel | Plus no right arm rest | I hope Nissan has one for 2009 and some form of a retro-fit for my 2008 | 
 "words": I traded a 1998 Buick Century with well over 100000 miles for this new Versa and to date am very happy I purchased it | My Buick was like a member of the family | For ten years I got in each morning turned the key and she started | Never a problem | So far my new Nissan is proving to be a worthy replacement | I average 35 MPG with a 6- speed transmission and the car is very comfortable | For the price 10000 my trade I cannot complain | The car even included power everything ABS keyless entry cruise control and splash guards |
