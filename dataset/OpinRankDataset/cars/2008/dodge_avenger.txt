 "words": What a great drive | I traded in my 2004 jeep liberty renegade for something that gets better gas mileage and I was not disappointed | I get 32 miles on the highways and 28 city | The 2 | 7V6 gives me lots of passing power and the stain repellent seats are worth their weight in gold | I tell everyone I talk to that the Japanese cars have got nothing on this |

 "words": I love the exterior look and the car handles well | I'm a little disappointed with the amount of recalls 3 so far and the radiator sprung a leak at the seam for no apperant reason | Luckly it was still under warranttee | The only other thing that concerns me is the erratic transmition shifting when the engine is cold | The ride is comfortable and I get comments on the sleek exterior | Pick up is good and it gets good gas mileage | Not the car to work on in your back yard though the battery is located under the left wheel well cover and nothing looks easy to work on under the hood | water pump alternater A C | etc | are all buried | I will probobly pay it off and sell it three years from now | 
 "words": I've had the car for abut 2 months now | It's great | A good priced head- turner | maybe even more than a Mustang | you know it's stylish when the guy driving a Mustang takes a long jealous look at your ride | Interior might be cheap but it is still somewhat in style | 
 "words": I have had 3 used cars and for this being my first brand new car I love it | I wanted the big Charger but the price was a little high so I settled for the little brother | No complaints though | This car looks tough and has the power and style to back it up | The 3 | 5 liter V-6 is impressive | It | s no race car but it moves | It has 240 hp from the factory vs | Ford | s Mustang V- 6 210 hp | Any questions | The ride is unbelievable | My grandfather has a Cadillac and he feels the avenger rides better | Nice car good price get one | I would have like the navigation system but just too much | Would recommend to anyone |

 "words": I got one of the first on the lot and fell in love with it at first sight | Great styling | Pick-up is great but I'm no rabbit and the worst mileage I've gotten is 28 | 1 with 32 | 2 on a recent long trip | Sure is nice to drive 7 hours before I have to fill up with cruise control set on 73 | I'm over 60 and it's easy to get in and out of | The interior is well laid out and very quiet | Love that can cooler and 6 CD changer for long drives | Fold down rear arm rest is the best yet for passengers | Trunk is humungous and makes it easy to stash lots of stuff | Also love the dual-level console with the sliding arm rest so I can put it where I need it | The adjustable lumbar support is great | 
 "words": I absolutely love this car | The way it looks the way it drives everything | I finally got rid of my Jeep after 10 years knew I was in the market for a sedan | My first choice was the Sebring but when we saw this car on the lot I had to drive it and oh my God | How I love this car | I haven't seen too many on the roads yet but I have a feeling this is going to be a very popular choice of vehicle for all people | 
 "words": The Avenger being my first car going from trucks in 15 years I was a bit nervous about how well I would settle in to driving it | But this car has turned out to be a blast to drive | Smooth shifting and handling responsive accelleration better than stated fuel economy 19 mpg combo hwy city and a bunch of nifty creature comforts | I will be interested to see how well the AWD with ESP does on icy roads | No regrets here | 
 "words": I bought this car because I was looking for an affordable AWD car that also had great looks | So far I am very satisfied with my Avenger | The R T trim adds the most powerful engine available and it is plenty powerful | The car can take off when I need it to | There is ample room both front and back | Watch for the blindspots they are numerous | Overall I am very happy with the car and in retrospect would still definately buy it | 
 "words": I have been looking for a new midsize car for the last few months and have been to every dealer we have in town here | This is the only care that stirred any emotional response from me and it did that very well | I drove the SXT and the R T the R T is defiantly the way to go if you like spirited driving | I have only had the car a few weeks but I haven | t found any thing to regret this buy | I really recommend this car for anyone shopping in the midsize market that wants to stand out and have fun doing so | 
 "words": This car is peppy and takes hills very well | Sharp styling | Fun to drive | Check out the paint before you drive in home from the dealer | I noticed when I got home a few imperfections in the paint | I have Silver Steel metallic and it's great | Plenty of room on a trip with kids | Don't think because it's 4 cylinder that's a dog | It's a 16 valve | 
 "words": Just bought this car and couldn't be happier | Did quite a bit of shopping and comparing before I purchaed it | Looked at the Caliber hard too since it's the same platform | Handles great very quick although slightly 'doggish' when the air is blasting 0-40 | The transaxle shifting is very nice and it looks great | Gas mileage on the first tank was around 25 | 
 "words": Very sharp looking with a 3 4 Charger look | Rides firm solid without being harsh | 6 speed automatic shifts quickly and smooth with no lag between gears | Mileage is same as advertised | Full of features like the upper bin that keeps soda cans cool and the hot or cold beverage holder in the console | Both ways work excellent | Interior lighting at night is awesome almost like high end aircraft | ATC keeps temperature inside constant no dialing up or down needed once you find your comfort zone | 3 | 5 engine is quiet and the exhaust has a really cool high performance sound | 
 "words": This car is great up hills | It isn't noisy like someone had said | I have the dark light slate seats and Silver Steel Metallic | The paint glistens in the sun | I am totally please with this car | 
 "words": I only have about 600 miles but am happy thus far | I purchased an extended warranty not happy with stadard warranty | I hope the quality continues and does not degrade over time | The AWD mileage is about 16 thus far with mixed driving which isn't good and about the worst for a car with its engine size and horse power | Wife's 2000 Nissan Pathfinder gets 17 under same conditions | Overall I like the car and think it's a good value for the money | 
 "words": We have the SXT with the 2 | 7L flex fuel engine | Rides far better on Michigan's roads than our Accord did | Interior design is also better | Unfortunately the interior has too much cheap hard and gray plastic | It's also slower than our 2001 Stratus ES with the same engine and gets 5 MPG less | Somehow Dodge has made this engine sound like it came from a bread truck instead of the nice exhaust sound on the Stratus and smooth acceleration | The Avenger seems to fight it's way up to speed | We have the upgraded seats and even those are awful | No comfort at all and they squeak like crazy | Like the looks love the design but needs better quality MPG and be put on a diet | Close but no cigar |

 "words": Would be nice if gas mileage would increase | I am not getting 28mpg | Car handles very well | One mistake I made was to add the rain guards they create too much of a blind spot | Overall I am very happy with it | 
 "words": My initial plans were to buy a Chrysler 300C this year | However the significantly lower price and sexy looks of the Avenger caught my attention when I went to the dealership | I first testdrove the SXT but then on impulse I decided to purchase the R T sitting on the showroom floor | I was amazed at the difference | The R T is at least as much fun to drive as the BMW 328i I had a few cars back | I bought it three days ago and I love driving it so much that I've already put a thousand miles on it | It's just fun to drive and a great value for the money | Also four people have plenty of room which is something I didn't expect in a car this size | 
 "words":  I looked at a lot of cars before I bought this Avenger and I must say I'm glad I waited for this car | The car is excellent in the city and on the highway | My R T is loaded with every available option and I think this car will be a classic | Thumbs up to the Dodge Avenger designers | 
 "words": Perfect for my needs | I don't really need the size or power of the Charger Mustang but I liked the exterior lines shape of the Charger | The Avenger's 4 cylinder engine is so quiet that you wouldn't expect the power behind it | Last tank was 32 mpg on the highway which is what I had hoped for | Handles great in the city for the money | 
 "words": Having owned this car less than a month I couldn't say much about reliability | I can say that it is fun to drive and has gotten me compliments from anyone that's seen it | The ride is smooth and great for cruising around over long distances or for short trips but this car still manages a feeling of control and sure- footedness in the turns | 
 "words": During the test drive I was somewhat skeptical | But after 20 minutes on the road I realized this is a really nice car | Maybe not as quick as some but the looks are super | The vehicle handles extremely well | The mileage is good as long as you don't get heavy on the gas pedal | The interior is a little stark but functional | I must admit for the money the vehicle is road worthy and I am happy with my choice |

 "words": This car certainly is an eye catcher which is why it sits in my driveway | My RT is black with chrome wheels and the spoiler | Lots of little goodies like the heat and cool cup holder tire pressure monitor fuel mileage monitor remote start autodim mirror with home link Sirius satellite and a few other things | 
 "words": Well I just bought my car on the 21st of March of 2007 and in the short time I have had it I love my new car The 4 CDR engine is extremely snappy and the acceleration is incredible | The ride and the mostly sound proof cab makes highway noise barely noticable and an outstanding ride | I highly recomend it for anybody | 
 "words": I bought a Dodge Avenger from online photos and I must admit I did not go crazy when I first saw it | However when I drove this car I really fell in love with it | It handles really well and I have the power to pass and go when I need it no problem | I also like the extra elecrical outlets and cup holders the fold down seats and the huge trunk on a good sized car | Not too big not too small | Just right | The price is fabulous I dare anyone to compare this car with anything in its size on the road today | 
 "words": Have had my Avenger for 18 months and really like the car but for two issues | The vision is terrible rear and side vision is hazardous especially on busy highways and around town | The RT head rests blocks any hope of seeing what is just behind you or beside you | Also every time you lift the trunk lid when it is raining all the water pours into the trunk no it is not just an alignment issue some one get this design wrong | I have contacted Dodge and they have no excuse | 
 "words": When I first purchased the car I thought it was wonderful | But now I cant wait to trade it off | There have been numerous recalls and now the electronic Throttle control is having issues | The front seats are very uncomfortable I cannot imagine a larger person sitting in them the blind spots | No you do not get use to them | There are some good points smooth to drive and roomy and does have pick up and go | Interior is plastic hard to clean and difficult to get things that have dropped between the seats | A new vehicle will be in my future very soon |

 "words": Transmission weak point on the vehicle | variable line pressure and modulated converter clutch not a good combination | car shudders during cruise has new updated converter and flash | still shudders | Check engine light on again | Fuel economy is pretty good and 4 wheel disc brakes work well | 2 | 7 Engine would be better with a manual transmission
 "words": I bought this vehicle with 20000 miles on it | As a person finishing up college I was looking for something reliable and affordable yet still stilish and interesting | Fuel consumption is amazing- I took a 300 mile trip at around 75 mph speeds and used only 1 2 tank of gas | I look for any reason to drive this car | The 4 cylinder engine isn't dissappointing- it delivers adequate acceleration and plenty of power for me | The speakers are great love the light grey interior and although the seats are a little uncomfortably firm I am adjusting | This isn't a luxury car but it's reasonably priced gets a ton of compliments and is a pleasure to operate plus the fuel economy is great | 
 "words": I bought this car with 14000 miles on it 8 months ago | It has ample power and plenty of interior space | It has more than it's share of blind spots and a rather cheesy interior | I like the sound system and smooth ride | But | without warning at 20000 mileswhen attempting to put the automatic transmission in gear one night after start up it would not budge | I tried everything suggested in the owners to no avail | Ended up getting towed to a dodge dealership where they somehow managed to unlock the shifter | They claimed to have replaced the shifter because it was broken which was an obvious lie | I have since learned that this locking shifter is a common Chrysler problem yet no recall is issued | 
 "words": i bought this car back in sept 2007 never was a big chrysler fan but test drove it and loved it | i admit the 4cyl was not to my liking so drove the 6cyl 2 | 7 flexfuel and fell in love | have had a few minor things wrong but all new models usually do | plus with the lifetime powertrain warranty dont have to much worrys | as far as the flexfuel i get less mileage but more horsepower than with the 87 octain where as with that i get better mileage but less horsepower | so those of you who are car shopping i recommend this vehicle | no complaints here | 
 "words": I owned a Toyota Corolla for the past 7 years and decided to buy American | Thought I'd go with a mini Charger muscle car and purchased the Avenger R T | Goes like stink but the payoff is frequent stops at the pump | 6 speed auto stick should have been better engineered with a 5 speed | The interior comfort could be better as well as the quality and construction of materials read cheap | Lots of great features though | Awesome sound system creature comforts galore powerful engine and lots of compliments from casual observers | Chrysler has something here if they would just finish it off with a better interior grade of materials | Fun to drive | I'd give it an 8 |

 "words": I have a 2008 Avenger SE with the VVT 4 cylinder and it is a fun car | Yeah the more expensive foreign cars and the luxurious Ford Fusion have more for the buck in some areas but let someone who drives one be the critic | This car | s engine and transmission is assisted by electronic computer main board like most new cars in this case the computer adjusts the engine and trans to your driving habits | I drive my Avenger on the Washington D | C | beltway where you have to get up and go | Well some folks have asked me if I had the six cylinders under the hood my car is fun to drive sporty and the safest thing on the road
 "words": Alright so this car is not worth it | I have the 2 | 4 and it won't get out of its own way | The radio is not good if you like to turn it up and have some fun | Rear drum brakes no abs | Really in 2008 | For my money you can get a more from other companies | Maybe the V6 loaded up is fun I'm sure but if you're in the market for the SE you are not going to be happy and have to look around and not just buy this car because you think it looks cool | 
 "words": I bought my vehicle in July of 2007 and a month later had to bring it in because I returned to the vehicle after leaving work and discovered the driver's side door hanging wide open | When I took it to the dealer I learned that there was a recall for the latches | During this year I have taken the car to the dealer five times and had three different recalls | Most recently the belly shield fell off the bottom of the vehicle | Now that it has been replaced the car is shaking the heat is not working and the temperature gauge is running hot so it appears I will be at the dealer once again | I regret purchasing this vehicle and would not recommend this product to anyone |

 "words": This car has help up great after one year | I was very hesitant buying an American car | My last vehicle was a Chevy S-10 that was a piece of crap | I swore I would never buy another American car again until I rented the Dodge Avenger on a trip | Interior Despite all of the reviews the interior is very nice and has held up with no squeaks or creaks | There could be a little padding on the arm rest and center console but otherwise very nice | Engine Drivetrain The weak point in this whole car is the 4 speed transmission it has quite a lag in shift points | The 6 speed offered in the R T is much much better | Rear drum brakes really | I thought these had died out |

 "words": I went with the 2 | 7 V6 with the 18 premium wheels and with the Inferno Red color | It is as sharp as can be | It does great in town and super-great on long trips | Really like the Sirius radio and for a standard stero with 6- speakers it sounds supreme | Being 6'2 the leg room is outstanding | The best part though is the body styling nice and manly not wimpy like the Camry | 
 "words": I have never been so disappointed in a vehicle in all my life | I purchased this to get rid of my GAS GUZZLING Durango | Went with another Dodge because they gave me a better trade value but boy the joke was on me | This car is built DIRT CHEAP | I've had it just over a year and thus far the following has gone bad and had to be replaced Fuel Pump Steering PumpValve Half-Shaft Water Pump Gasket | And with all this problems persist but unfortunately warranty has ended | 
 "words": I love this car and it handles so well | I have put 9000 miles on it as I work for the state and travel a good bit | It can handle any traffic conditions and very good gas mileage | I actually get more than the stats that were stated when I bought it | The cooler thing is not what I thought it would be but the satellite radio has spoiled this ole gal's music experience I can never be without it again | And the spoiler and moonroof makes me feel younger | Not | But hey nice car | 
 "words": i too have the chatter in the transmission | they did a flash and that didn't help there is a flash update for the auto stick | then they say they can't find the problem or replicate the problem | then i finally get a tech to ride with me and as soon as we leave the lot it shift from 1-4 before i get to 30 mph and shakes the crap out of the whole car | then they replaced the torque converter | much better but can still feel something wrong | i almost guarantee it's the torque converter |

 "words": I have to say that the styling on the new Avenger blows me away every time I look at It | It looks like a mini Charger and for the price of a base Charger Mine is almost fully loaded | My main problem has been with the nav radio | This is the third time my car has been in the shop in three months | I am on my second Nav radio and still have problems | The radio does not respond or turns off while driving or there is no volume | I also noticed my daytime lights go out when I signal | The ugly has to be the light colored sun visors and roof | I can see the sun visors getting dirty and they must be cleaned often | The front headrests need to be redesigned | 
 "words": I have had my 08 Tor Red Avenger SXT for a couple of months now and love it | If you are looking for a performance car this is not for you | If you want stylish economical transportation that turns heads take a look at this car | It won't disappoint | Seating for me is very comfortable 5'6 fits the curve of my back just right | Mygig radio is a nice system though I am disappointed as I thought I could load my iPod onto it and can't because it doesn't read the mP4 format | You can use the aux input to play your iPod through the system though | If I had known that I'd of stuck with the regular radio as I find myself having to look at the radio to change stations which is distracting | 
 "words": I've owned a truck for the last 30 years and never thought I would own a car again | The Avenger changed my mind | The exterior definitely turns heads when you're driving down the road | The interior is surprisingly roomy and trunk space is great | The blue dashboard glow is very soothing and the instrument panel is laid out nicely | There are however three things that I would personally change in the interior and they are add an overhead compartment for sunglasses raise the center console a bit higher for a more comfortable armrest and flatten the headrest a bit so it doesn't feel like your head is being pushed forward | The headrest was an easy fix for me by turning it around |
