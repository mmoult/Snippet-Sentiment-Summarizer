REVIEWS
 "words": Outstanding comfort with all of the luxury items at the fingertips of the driver | My wife loves the power lift gate heated seats and overall space in the vehicle | Since it is the LTZ the bose system and dvd make long range travel a pleasure | 
 "words": They just keep getting better | I had a Tahoe and 2 other Suburbans previously | The '98 Suburban I had really felt like it stuck to the road the '01 lost that truck feel and felt loose | The ride of the '08 is great the appearance is great the highway city mixed mileage is about 16 on gas and 13 on E85 | I like the on- board computer w mileage performance XM Radio On-Star and monthly status e- mails | The kids like the heated rear seats and DVD player plus they can load all of their junk easily | 
 "words": A Nice ride good mileage for a big truck 18 around town 22 highway 75 mph | Have been on two long trips with no problems | But they left out a lot of little things that made my'96 more fun to drive with 165000on it | 
 "words": This is my fourth Chevy truck 2 Silverados 1 Tahoe previously | They just keep getting better | I have never had any problems with any of them | The Suburban is by far the best | I have the Z71 package and love it | It is great for our large family either around town or on longer trips | Now if I can just get my wife to get one | She is still not confident driving such a large vehicle | If you need a large SUV this is a great one | 
 "words": Driving my new Suburban has been a total pleasure | The LTZ trim package makes this a true luxury to drive | The power towing capacity and room for 8 make this the total package for large families | This is first time my wife has ever uses a truck more then me | She likes driving our Suburban as much as I do and I don't mind beaning a passenger for a change | Our standards for this vehicle have been high traded in a Toyota 4 Runner and Chevy has really won me back with a quality product | In this class of vehicle there is no computation just the standard Suburban | 
 "words": This is our 5th Suburban and the only keep getting better | We bought an LTZ that was a company PIP vehicle | Bought it loaded with 10k miles on it | Have already put 7k more | Rides like a dream | Found out I have a transmission leak at the bell housing | I am not happy about that especially since it was driven by a GM exec and cared for by GM | Dealer is working on it as I write this | Hopefully it will be like new when done | It is by far the best truck on the road | Just hope GM is around to honor the remainder of the warranty if I need it | 
 "words": Traded 05 Z71 Tahoe that was fully loaded for my LTZ | Great truck getting 19ish on highway | Dark Interior color rocks love the power everything rides great fun to drive nav is great | Already had onstar XM but they are still nice | Excellent quality ride is great | Considered changing brands until I drove the new style | Great job GM
 "words": My 2000 Excursion diesel got totaled | I loved it even with 200K miles | I looked at the expedition XL but the MPG was 25 less then the Burb | I got an LT1 for 30085 including added GM leather | Plus I got a 500 Lowes card | The sticker was over 40K great rebates | Although the ford rode much smoother and was more comfortable the burb got better MPG and was about 7000 cheaper so I decided to try the Chevy | So far I really like it
 "words": Strong quality SUV for the price | Owned a Durango and loved it but the Suburban is considerably a better SUV | It has more than enough room for the family on long trips and has great towing capability | Looked long and hard before I decided to trade in | It gets better MPG rides better and more comfortable | Of course MPG is not the best but it has features that crossovers to not | I added a KN filter and it helped increase the MPG | Overall very satisfied with the Suburban | 
 "words": Traded my 07 Expedition EL for a LTZ White Diamond pkg Suburban for a cheaper monthly payment and better gas mileage | I'm getting worse gas mileage than before 13 | 5 mpg mixed city highway vs | 15 | 1 mpg with the Expedition | But with all SUVs I don't expect great gas mileage | I love this car more than any other SUV I've ever owned | It drives great is great looking comfortable roomy it is an all aound great buy-got a steal on it too | Fits my family of 5 wonderfully and is very safe | I have active fuel management and you never can tell when it switches from 4cyl to 8 | I will not be buying another vehicle until this one is shot | 
 "words": Great vehicle for family and for pulling | Great ride quiet cabin good sound system | Looks great on road
 "words": Figured it time to upgrade from our 1994 Burb w 208k miles | Has been a true workhorse and reliable at that | Waited for second year of new model and we're completely satisfied with our LTZ professional reviews spot on | The only option we didn't get was retractable steps | The engineering is solid materials first rate and quality no longer an issue | As for the mpg I work in a trauma center ER and suffice to say those in larger late model vehilces with all the latest safety features predictably do much better | When one considers the cargo family the mpg becomes at least of us a distant secondary concern | Better safe than sorry | 
 "words": Had a 99 Burb but stuff kept going wrong so ended up with a new 08 LTZ | Overall great truck and I love to drive it | Average about 14mpg city 0 | 7-1 mpg less than onboard pc states and around 10mpg towing my boat | In 3 | 5 months I have put over 5K miles on it | Personally I think it looks awesome inside and out and the materials seem top notch | except for one thing and this is why I wanted to leave a review | In less than 4 months my passenger side headlamp is already starting to cloud up | I live in TX and where I park it gets full sun from noon to dusk but for a 50K vehicle this is absolutely unacceptable | 
 "words": I had a 2002 so I can vouch for all the additions | When they said completely redesigned they meant it | I find the fuel economy extremely good for a beast of this nature | I drive for a living and in less than a year have put 30000 miles on my truck mostly city miles and it still drives like new its a work horse | I shopped the Escalade overpriced Denali not as good looking Expedition not a better ride Navigator overpriced and the Suburban seemed to me the better buy | Great power fun to drive nice look and reliable | I would buy it again | 
 "words": I bought this car because I love my 2003 Tahoe Z71 so much | Phenominal truck | You can't break it with a baseball bat | I gave my wife the Tahoe and traded her Ford Windstar in for the Suburban which I now drive | Excellent ride nice power good braking | I bought the LTZ so it has all of the creature comforts | Very comfortable | You could drive this car for days without tiring | Personally I think it is the nicest looking truck on the street with my Tahoe a close runner up | For city or combo driving I average 16 mpg | I tend to go 75 80 mph on the highway which gives me slightly less than 16 mpg | The Windstar would give me 20 plus on the highway so that is a disappointment | 
 "words": My family loves this Suburban | The space is comfortable and they love the DVD player and the radio | The fact that we can listen to different things at the same time | 
 "words": I love this vehicle | I traded my 2003 burb in on this 08 and I love it | The ride is much better and the gas mileage isn't bad for a truck this size especially with the deactivation mode | It changes smooth w o notice | I love the seating refinements I drove all the way to Ga about 8 hrs and I was not tired it was great | Keep up the good work Chevy I love ya | 
 "words": Purchased in Feb 08 | Currently have about 1700 miles on it and love it | We opted for the Z71 model because of the ability to go on moderate off road trails | I will probably look into putting a small lift on it eventually as ground clearence isn't what it should be for 4x4 | my 99 Silverado z71 has more ground clearence than this but for a family vehicle we will love it and keep it for well over 200000 miles | Also like the fact we can put e85 in it though I will confess in Denver traffic we only get about 11 miles to the gallon | But at 2 | 19 a gallon it only costs 65 to fill instead of 95 w 91 octane | The e85 gets us about 300mpg vs 450mpg with 91 | No 6spd tranny for 1500 | 
 "words": Purchased in January 08 | Vehicle rides very good | My wife is impressed with the purchase she even likes to drive it | The GPS backup camera is a excellent feature | We utilize the GPS most of the time | The vehicle's performance is exceptional with the active fuel management getting 19 | 5 mph at 70 mph | 
 "words": Without a doubt the best bang for the buck in todays market | I purchased a 4WD LTZ with all the options | This car looks good is wel built and perform extremely well for the size | Build quality is fine and there are no issues I can find so far | For ski trip of hauling kids and stuff there is very little competition |

 "words": I took posession of my factory ordered Suburban the weekend before the GM labor strike | The quality of my unit should be an example no problems noted so far | I test drove the Suburban Yukon XL and Hummer H2 over a several month period before deciding to order | The new exterior is pleasing the interior is well designed and comfortable | Leather in Titanium soiled easy later added Factory seat covers | Radio sounds great GPS unit has worked flawlessly though needs upgrade for new road construction in last year | Engine accelerates smooth | in-city driving 11MPG | highway cruise control driving 23 MPH at 55MPH 19MPH at 65MPH 16-17MPH at 75MPH | 4WD Auto provides good traction in snow | 
 "words": Bought our 2008 Suburban on 9 18 | We were evaluating the Expedition EL and the Sub | I found the Suburban to have better interior quality | The standard suspension is very smooth | The 08 has redesigned gauge faces | They look better than the 07's | Sound system standard sounds great | Ebony Leather seats very comfortable | V8 Power is great | Wife took a trip from LA to Phoenix | Averaged 17 MPG with mixed City Hwy driving | An excellent value | You cannot go wrong on this one | We got the Blue Granite Metallic paint | It is very sharp | We were staying away from normal white silver black | 
 "words": I just traded in my Yukon Xl for the Suburban | Overall this is a great SUV | It looks stylish yet rugged and is very functional | The car is easy to drive and has a great turn radius | I feel very safe driving my kids around in this car | The new seat design is great | The driver's seat and passagner's seats are extremely comfortable | The lumbar support is superior | The front controls are easy to use and positioned very well | 
 "words": Our 2008 Tahoe was delivered just a few days ago | I absolutely love it | The interior is beautiful and designed well for families | We have the rear entertainment package with the DVD player and I love just flipping the screen down and popping in the movie | No cords or wires to mess with | The split bench seats are genius increases cargo space without losing an entire row of seating | It performs well and it is interesting to watch it switch from V8 to V4 on the highway | My average fuel economy thus far is around 18 and that includes a 200 mile highway trip and around town driving |
