REVIEWS
 "words": I have disliked this car since I had to drive it in snow the first week I owned | I thought it would be o | k | to buy a FWD instead of an AWD | I was wrong and so was my salesman | He didn't think I would have a problem | Obviously he didn't know what he was talking about | I won't buy another car from Superior Chevrolet | After making attempts to get some kind of resolution I was unsuccessful | 
 "words": The car drives great and is pretty reliable | It rains in puddles on the back floor board and back where tire is stored | Nothing else in the car gets wet | I vacuumed a 1 2 gallon of water | The dealership has no idea where the water is coming from | Seats headliners and inside interior are all dry | 
 "words": I find you get alot for your money but I've had my car only a year and 6 months and already had the left front and the right front axle changed along with a door handle that fell of an interior passenger visor | I also had to have my ac panel changed because of peeling and now I'm awaiting a passenger door lock controller and a front right head light | It makes me wonder how much I'm going to have to spend after the 2 YEAR warranty if I will have to bear these frequent visits to the garage without even being in an accident and owning a new car | I would suggest a different car | I'm think of the new Audi cross over Hyundia | By the way I hate the unsteady cup holders an cheap old fashion ac vents | 
 "words": I had a 2007 kia until I found the equinox | I was originally looking at a Pontiac torrent which is a sister to the equinox | I ended up buying the equinox | Its actually wider than the torrent and the front ends are different | We recently drove it to fla for a Cruise and it was a wonderful ride verses the kia | Only bad thing is the stupid plastic cup holders | And no where to lay your phone or smokes but I fixed that problem easily | I bought a small office wire basket at walmart and put it on the dash now I have space to stash a lot | The radio is great but the speakers arent as good as I had in my kia | But overall I give this suv a 10 | 
 "words": I traded my Impala for the Equinox because we were going on a road trip and wanted more room | The Equinox has that | We traveled from Texas to Califoria and back without a hitch | Gas mileage is good | Lots of leg room | I like the sporty look of the Equinox even though it is not the sport model | The position of the windo controls took a little getting used to | All in all I would recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": I was skeptical of the reviews of the Equinox from this website | I debated between the Trailblazer and Equinox but under pressure to trade my very undesirable Honda CRV I took the plunge and bought the Equinox | I've had it now for 16 months and 22k miles | This car beats the CRV hands down | It is much more comfortable has more power has a smoother ride roomier much quieter and the gas mileage is actually comparable | Glad I traded the CRV and didn't get the Trailblazer | Problems I've had to replace two batteries and the radio all under warranty | I don't know why the batteries are being discharged prematurely | 
 "words": I took my pregnant wife 8 monthsto the car show and we spent 4 hours trying out nearly every SUV and minivan made | Fortunately we both loved the Equinox with its style safety rating and overall flexibility | My wife could no longer fit into her Ford Escort and she absolutely loves the new Equinox | Our baby boy also seems to like it spending long car rides sleeping in the rear seat | The cup holders are ok and the window controls take a little getting used to location | Overall it is a good value and a sensible car to start our family in | 
 "words": I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this car | It's very roomy and quiet on the road with a lot of features not available on the competition | I have the mid-grade LT1 front wheel drive model | It's easy to see out of fore and aft so driving parking and backing up is easy | The gas mileage is great | I have been averaging over 20 city hiway and it only requires regular gas | Given I have only the mid level model | it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile | However it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions which makes the steering feel a too light | Upgraded models might mitigate this | Lastly while the seats are comfy they are a bit too soft on long drives | 
 "words":  Rear doors fill with rain dust snow dirt when going down road | When doors are opened the fender wells are covered with dirt dust snow water making it impossible to use rear seats with out getting clothes ruined | Dealer won't correct nor will G | M | Sorry | 
 "words": I just traded a 2002 Ford Explorer for this Equinox and I'm loving it | I can still hardly believe I qualified for one but I did | It is such a cute roomy SUV for my family and I | I can't wait to take it on a road trip and see how well it does | I love how much lower to the ground this vehicle sits it makes getting kids in and out easy | There is a ton of leg room in the back even when my 6' hubby is driving | The sliding back seat is great along with the 'purse cubby' under the front center console | A very basic vehicle but still enough extra little things to set it apart | What really caught my attention was the crash test ratings | So very important when driving with little ones | 
 "words": I love the look of my Equinox | After driving cars for years I really enjoy sitting up higher | 
 "words": I love my new Equinox | I was originally looking for a Honda CR-V but the moment I saw the Equinox I switched | Honda CR-Vs seems cheap looking compared to the Chevy Equinox | I'm also glad to buy American | 
 "words": This vehicle is fun to drive and is quite comfortable | Has decent power and handling | Love the colour Granite Gray Metallic yet the interior tends to be somewhat spartan typical chevy although I see the 2010 model improves dramatically upon that | Turning radius is too large and the usual issue with the cup holders is a hindrance and they are also somewhat flimsy | Back seat a model of versatility as it moves 8 fore and aft to accommodate either passengers or cargo | I do like the height of the rear liftgate although shorter persons may find it tough to reach | Overall a fine vehicle and the AWD feature works well in Chicago area winters | Upgraded Pioneer stereo is rad | 
 "words": This SUV is definitely the best purchase for a family in our opinion | The Equinox has more than enough power and for tall or bigger person is is ideal | After much researching for almost a year this car is extremely safe and puts the mind at ease with safety | We have a big truck and didn't want to sacrifice room and power for great gas mileage of a car | Although I wish I had gone with the LS this is my only regret | This base model has more than enough gadgets and the OnStar is wonderful | I work night shift and live in the country and after a serious accident about a year ago I am so comfortable driving in the snowy conditions on back roads | With only the FWD I have never had a problem | 
 "words": Experience rather noisy | Car has a whine at 35 mph that dealer says is normal | My wife will not drive it as she cannot find a comfortable seat adjustment position for her short legs | She has no problems with our Ford product | The fuel mileage is terrible | I sold my pickup to get better mileage but it did not happen | 
 "words": We bought a 2008 Chevy Equinox LT-2 trim package after looking at the Ford Escape and Edge and the Jeep Liberty | The Equinox fits me fine and I'm 6ft 5 285lbs | And January 24 2008 we proved its crash test ratings | I fell asleep at the wheel around noon and hit the guide rails on I-79 with cruise set at 68 | Looks like I hit them head on | Took out 5 posts then rolled and slid down into grass | It totaled the car and all we got was sore necks from seatbelts | Even the airbags didn't hurt hitting us | But I think they saved our lives we had 5 in car | 3 kids in back | 5 star 4 sure | 
 "words": At least that's what my husband calls it | My little rollerskate | I've had it almost a year now and its still as fun to drive as it was the day I bought it | My little AWD goes through the deep snow like a dream | There's tons of room in the back for the kids to stretch out and we can still take the dog along with us on road trips and it gets decent gas mileage | The only complaint I have for my Equinox is that it is a little lightweight if the wind is really blowing I have to keep both hands at 10 and 2 to keep it steady | But up here in Michigan we don't get too many windy days so it's only been a stressful ride once or twice | All in all it's a great little family car | Cute and fun to drive | 
 "words": Well I traded in my 02 Envoy for the 08 Equinox sport and by far I miss the smoothness of the ride the Envoy had | I had 150000 miles on it and it still rode better | I like the Equinox I don't love it | I do like the mpg better though | The turning radius is not good | Lots of blind spots | It's kind of a flimsy car | My buddy sat on the hood and it dented so easily but I guess that is just how cars are built today | It handles very nice but does not shift smooth at all | When I have the cruise control on it annoys me | It is good in the snow but wish I would of got AWD | I love the remote start and the heated seats | I have the good stereo but for some reason it does not get loud enough | 
 "words": With gas prices were soaring my husband and I no longer wanted to keep a truck and we traded in his 1997 Silverado for the Equinox | We wanted a small SUV with AWD for winter driving | It handles well in bad weather | rides comfortably but it hesitates when trying to excellerate on the highway | I didn't like the window controls on the console at first but I got use to it | Gas mileage was great on a trip to Ocean City MD | We got about 29 mpg | My husband was excited about that | There is not a lot of room in the front | The cup holders are cheap and awkward | Despite a few negatives we both like our Equinox | Unfortunately my husband still misses his truck even though he likes our new SUV | 
 "words": I came down in size from a TrailBlazer EXT to this Equinox Sport to save gas | Best thing I ever did | This little mover can get up and run | It brought back fun in driving | Mileage is OK considering the HP it has | Good move | 
 "words": Within days of purchase realized the motor was too loud | Dealership said that was normal only to rescind that point of view a week later when we took a stand that it was unacceptable | Vehicle in the shop more than 2 weeks while they tore the motor down and discovered a bent connector rod | All fixed up at no additional cost to us but not very impressed with a rebuild on my new vehicle | Recent problems include the inside windows actually frosting up and staying covered in ice despite the blowers going full tilt | again dealership indicated this is a problem with these types of vehicles | Wonderful news | To top it off this morning the thing wouldn't start | Towed to the dealership again | 
 "words": I first got this car because I liked the way it looked and it was the only SUV out there at the time that was roomy but didn't feel like you were driving an 18 wheeler | The price was great too compared to the other SUVs of similar size that were available | I have not had a problem with it and I especially loved the free for 1 year OnStar service it came with | Although they skimped out on the turn-by-turn direction service | You can only ask for directions 1 time | After that you have to pay for it | go figure | I also like that you could adjust the rear seat to move further back for more leg room | 
 "words": GM has hit their mark with the 08 Equinox Sport most of the reviews I've read from actual drivers not people who write car reviews for a living I'm talking people who actually matter say that the 3 | 4L engine was underpowered and not overly responsive | This is not the case with the 3 | 6L engine | this engine growls and throws you back in your seat on a whim | The interior space is actually amazing on all Equinox trims when looking at the Equinox on the outside it looks like a really small SUV Crossover but when inside and you start to load it up you would never know how small this vehicle actually is | I would recommend this vehicle for anyone interested in sport handling and cargo room | 
 "words": We've made a couple of trips to the VA mountains from the central NC area after installing a reciever hitch and hauling a ROLA cargo box | We've been through a couple of oil changes 3000mi and we like our Equi more than when we first got it | Gas mileage on our trips which includes a lot of mountain roads and town driving has averaged almost 22 MPG on both trips | We confirmed the computer reading by figuring it the old fashioned way just to make sure | Have had a couple of small warranty items repaired with no problem | This is a fun vehicle to drive and my wife primary user loves it | Sun roof and leather makes it nice | Entry front and back is great I'm 6'2 and 255lbs | 
 "words": We took our new Equinox on a road trip a week after we got it a very pleasant ride | Comfortable seats the long wheelbase makes the ride smoother easy to get into | Fuel economy is much better than my 06 Trailblazer and there is more interior room for passengers | The big cooler sits flat on the floor in the back seat XM radio OnStar are also great | The electric steering is quiet and efficient | It is just a great ride | We're going again in a couple of weeks and I can't wait to get on the road | Then in everyday life it's easy on gas around town easy to park simple to maneuver | Plenty of room for stuff in the back too | This might be my most favorite car ever | 
 "words": Just got my 2008 Equinox Sport | I'm liking it more and more | Fun to drive | The map pocket is a little uncomfortible against my right leg | It handles great on the road | 
 "words": I bought the LTZ black metallic after lots of research | Had the Escape for 4 years and never got used to the rough ride | RAV4 seemed just as rough on the test drive | Considered the Santa Fe but it didn't have the 'cool' look and features even though storage is a little better | Agree with others about bad cup holders no room to access driver side recline lever and limited storage | My gas mileage is about 17-18 mostly in town driving | Sunroof fog lights remote start and XM are fun to have and the roomy back seat is great for adults | The wasted space btwn front seats is annoying and I wish I had more places to stuff things | My first black car and it has been great in California
 "words": I love this car | My first SUV and I never thought I would ever want one | I got it because many times I would buy something and not be able to get it home in my car | My 80lb dog rides nicely in the back area | Plenty of room for him to stretch | People with long legs can sit comfortably in the back seat | I haven't found anything I don't like about this car | Lots of great features included that are usually options on other cars | Would recommend this car | 
 "words": This is my second Equinox and I love it more that the first | The AWD is great for winters here | The gas mileage is good for a car this size and one considered an SUV crossover | I still can't believe how much 'stuff' and I can cram into it | Back seats are good for riding with my long legged sons | Only drawback is the 'blindspots' in the back corners and front also | 
 "words": Traded a 2006 Equinox LT for 2008 LTZ | Wanted an SUV with GPS | This is the best deal on the market for features and upgrades included | Very comfortable ride | Gas mileage is acceptable | 
 "words": We researched mid size sports utes extensively | This seemed the best combination of interior room price fule economy and towing capacity for our needs | Fuel economy has been a plesant suprise 23 mpg overall 27 highway | It tows our 2100 lb boat well | Seats are comfortable and roomy | It rides and handles well | We don't think you can beat it for the price | 
 "words": This is my second Equinox first was an '05 | I loved my first but wanted a remote start plus some of the other new features | I'm getting 20 | 5mpg mixed driving straight highway I get 29-30mpg | Remote start is great as is the XM and OnStar | I miss the cargo shelf in my '05 but the space that's freed up is really nice | I don't care for the double cup holder in the front | If you pull up the emergency brake you can't put a drink on the left side | Also the air will not stay on the recirculate setting on certain vent settings and reverts back to exterior air when you re-start the engine | 
 "words": I have driven 1000 miles so far and I can't believe the fuel efficiency from this SUV | With good driving habits I am getting 18 | 5 in the city and 30 on the highway | I avoided purchasing an SUV because they are typically gas hogs | This has the perfect mix of MPG HP Torque | It's 3500lb towing capacity pulls my camper with ease | The ride is just right | Not squishy like a minivan but not too truck like either | The steering is not real responsive and takes a few miles to get used to | Once you are accustomed to the feel you will enjoy its light touch and accuracy | The spare tire is stored inside the SUV keeping it from weathering | The stereo is a bit flat but acceptable for factory | 
 "words": I previously leased a 2006 Trailblazer and while I like'd the room the fuel economy was bad and it handled slow | Being 28 I wanted a sports car I wanted an SUV I needed something smaller and I wanted AWD for the winter | The result was the Equinox Sport AWD and I couldn't be happier | Very fast very comfortable tons of room and a comfortable back seat sporty cool looking and a great premium stereo system unlike the Bose from the TrailBlazer | Overall I'm very happy and I couldn't of made a better choice that fit me year round in an environment that has extreme weather of the summer and winter | 
 "words": I've had my Equinox for four months now and am very pleased with my purchase | I test drove practically every SUV in the class and the Equinox came out on top | I came close to buying a Rogue but the interior was cramped and lacked features | I am partial to the exteriors of the RAV4 and the Ford Edge | however they are also lacking in the features department at least on the basic models | The Equinox comes with a lot of bells and whistles for the price | I love the OnStar feature and the information screens | With one push of a button I can check my oil life tire pressure and remaining gas mileage etc | The fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle its size | Overall a great purchase | 
 "words": We upgraded to the leather interior because the cloth interior was less comfortable and did not look like it would last long | There is lots of room in this SUV | We are getting 25 mpg plus right off the show room floor that includes a 50-50 mix of city and highway driving | There is very little road noise on the inside while driving | Vehicle handles well and has more than enough power with 6 cylinder engine | The report of the cup holders is accurate they are pretty chintzy | The lever for the steering wheel adjustment is also more difficult to operate while driving | Wish the rear hatch had an automatic open with the key chain the gas cap door had a lock | 
 "words": The Chevy Equinox has been a great car for me | I am a detached insurance agent and this car has givin me plenty of room and comfort | It has a pretty great stereo system for those time that I have been in traffic jams and not had much to do | It gives me plenty of room in the cargo area for both my filing boxes and my luggage and for the size of the car the fuel economy isn't bad at all | All around it has been a great car for the business man and his family | 
 "words": Very pleased weith vehicle alert and steady | Since using MOBIL 1 mileage is respectable at around 19 with a few extra PSI in the 18 tires too | The paint and overall appeareance of the car is snazzy | Could use a few grab handles and more storage pockets | 
 "words": I purchased a base Equinox in 2005 and thought it was great but needed a bit more power | I just upgraded to the sport model which has 90 more hp and other upgrades as well | I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a small medium sized SUV | 
 "words": For the money it is the best midsize crossover vehicle period | Easy entry exit | I have a bad lower back | Great view when driving | Very comfortable | A lot of room | Great engine transmission brakes | Prefer old style steering | Electric steering is kind of numb vague | Not good road feel like traditional steering | Would like to see 6 speed automatic and engine with more horsepower and torque | I get a lot of compliments | Mine is ruby red | 
 "words": The ride in the Equinox is very smooth the suspension is great and it drives like a car | I was also surprised coming from a much larger engine that the smaller V6 still has a lot of get up and go | In addition I'm getting 25mpg highway and 21-22 city | To me this is the best feature especially since the gas tank holds 20 gallons which I think it kinda big for this size SUV | Anyway its nice to be able to go over 400 miles on one tank | I just started a carpool at work and the Equinox easily fits 4-5 adults especially with the rear seat set back | 
 "words": I needed more room and traded in my Chevy Malibu 2004 | I love the versitility and space | It drives great and handles even better in bad weather with traction control | 
 "words": Overall I like the 2008 Chevy Equinox however I am very unhappy with the center console | The emergency brake is in the wrong spot and the 12VDC outlet is right under the pullout cupholders | Liquid and power do not mix well | I am really unhappy after reading earlier articles about the 2006 Chevy Equinox with the same complaints | Will American car companies ever get their act together | 
 "words": This is my second Equinox | I previously leased a 2006 AWD LT | I recently bought the 2008 because of great dealer incentives | This one has much better handling fewer blind spots and a excellent comfortable ride | I like the standard OnStar which I used to have in my leased Trailblazers 3 of them | The gas mileage is excellent 25-26mpg hwy even though I'm still in the process of breaking it in | I get a lot of compliments on it and it looks very sharp in black | I also got the remote start and it is awesome cheap add-on too | I looked a lot of vehicles and am so glad I bought this one | 
 "words": This is my first GM or NA product in 15 years and I love it | Not perfect but a pretty good SUV | 
 "words": I guess i got screwed because mine didn't come with free OnStar for a year or 3 mo | of XM radio | I did buy it used though with 15000mi | I do like the smooth drive and I think the seat cusions are very comfortable | I do not like the interior | Looks very cheap on the doors and center console | I'm not a big fan of the cushion pattern | I came from an 03 Eclipse Spider convertable with leather | I wish I had a sunroof at least | 
 "words": Only first 2000 miles but so far we are extemely happy | Had a 2000 Venture and this is much more fun | MPG is not quite as good but we are around 20 MPG for her work commute | Look forward to some summer travel | Wife's back bothers her and the supportive seats really help her | 
 "words": My wife and I recently bought this SUV for her daily driver and she could not be more pleased with it | Overall 21mpg and 25mpg on the highway | Smooth ride and great price combine for a happy Chevy customer | 
 "words": I traded in my 2003 Chevy TrailBlazer EXT for the Equinox | The best thing that I ever did | The gas mileage is wonderful | I only fill up once a week instead of twice a week | I travel 50 mile round trip for work and it has helped a lot due to the jacked up gas prices | 
 "words": We have owned vans for many years but decided we wanted to size down | I loved the look price of this car and the ride is good | Some of the interior design is a little cheap in quality but with the good price of the car you have to expect that | The two things I do not like are the sun visors are too short they could use an extension of some type the way the hatch opens it is hard to get it open you have to grab it in just the right place | We do take a number of weekend trips and have found the gas mileage to be getting better | We are getting about 30 miles to the gallon now | Too bad the gas tank could not be a little bigger but like I said we owned vans before | 
 "words": Owned the Sport version for 5 months now and love it | Very comfortable seating both front and rear plenty of room all around | Sport version has a stiffer ride than other versions but not too harsh handling is top-notch | Terrific forward visability and very stable and quiet at highway speeds | If there is a better crossover SUV in this price range I haven't seen it | Only low note is that I wish fuel mileage was 2-3 mpg better but who doesn't | 
 "words": After test driving suv's from Honda Pilot Fords Edge GMC Acadia Saturn Vue we decided on the Chevy Equinox | Two main reason's | 1 | Ease of getting in and out of the vehicle | 2 | This was the only vehicle that didn't have an obstructed view by wide front door window trims | The viewing area is much more open than any of the others | We also found the dash was not raised or slanted upward but smoothly angles downward | Both my wife and I have bad backs and it's entry is with ease on my 6'2 280lb frame | My wife just lost both breasts to cancer and pulling down on the rear hatch is not a problem as it was with the other SUV's | All in all a well rounded design and earthy downhome elegance | 
 "words": Vehicle looks great | Sonama Red Metalic with silver pinstripes | Performance is outstanding and the vehicle gets a lot of looks and positive comments | Heated leather seats are a big plus | Love the Pioneer sound system and the sunroof | Did not really plan on getting the sport as looked at the lower end models but glad purchased this model instead | Only problem so far was in-dash cd player | It would just quit playing discs at certain times | Once ignition switch was turned off for a few minutes the cd player would work again | Sometimes for a few hours sometimes for just a few songs | Tried different discs and same problem | Dealership replaced the radio cd player now works fine | 
 "words": I bought the LTZ New Year's Eve and I am very pleased with this vehicle | I drive a lot of highway miles and average about 23 mpg driving 65 mph | It drives smoothly handles well though turning radius isn't the tightest | With the back seat pulled all the way forward there is plenty of cargo room and with it all the way back plenty of leg room | The Pioneer sound system w subwoofer gives premium sound | I would suggest adding more storage compartments | The driver's visor extends but the passenger's does not kind of odd | 
 "words": Really disappointed that I bought this truck | Traded in my 2003 fully loaded Trailblazer EXT and this is such a step down | GM really went the cheap route in the interior | The Sport version lists for 40k Cdn and there are so many better trucks for that amount of money | The biggest complaint is the ride | From what I can tell the Sport is the worst of them all but it is totally uncomfortable and bounces all over the road | This will be traded quite soon | 
 "words": Well I have only had the car about a week but it is fun to drive and has great pickup | I have the sport which gives 265 hp or so | I do wish there was a automatic release for the rear hatch by either remote and or inside latch either way would be nice otherwise I am very happy with it and hopefully will be for a long time | 
 "words": I have only had the vehicle one week and so far I am very happy with it | I am impressed with all the features it has for the amount of money it cost | I especially like the automatic start | I am a single woman and this is a good feature for me | I also like the OnStar feature and hands free telephone | I drive to work every day a 52 mile round-trip day so far I am getting approx 21 MPG | I hope to get better as the car breaks in of course this is a lot better than what I was getting with my Chevy Avalanche | My friends are very impressed with the looks of the vehicle inside and out | So far I think I made a good decision to buy an Equinox | 
 "words": Runs great in that have had no problems so far but only have 3000 miles | Has great pick-up when needed corners well | Style is impressive and everything inside makes sense | The ride is not as smooth as I'd like to have it but we're not talking a Caddy here | Drive conservative and get 25 MPG but do little city driving | Realistically I'd probably get 21 if I drove like I used to do when gas wasn't gold plated but if we can put a man on the moon surely we could design one that gets 30 mpg | 
 "words": I am not happy with the location of the lever to adjust the stirring wheel | It is not safe when you are on a long trip and you need to change setting's | I have to pull over to do it as it is hard to do it over correct and turn into some one | And I am not a tall so I need to change it on trips and also the adjustment on moving the seat up and down | It stinks | The emergency brake is in a location the is really unhandy | I wish I would have check this car out more | Should get more for what you pay for thise car's | Did not want to pay real big money out and this is what you get | Poor quality | I hope to trade in couple years | I always was with GMC | I needed a car at the time think I was pushed | 
 "words": I went into the dealership just to look at the Equinox | I did research online first I test drove the car and after talking with the sales man I bought it | I gotta say I have only had it a month and I love it | It's high off the ground but not too high | The engine is so quiet | I would definitley recomomend it | In fact my mom might be getting one too | 
 "words": I recently bought this car while on leave from Iraq and I must say I love this vehicle | I couldn't stop driving it | It is fun to drive and has a lot of room inside | My two daughters love it also | My wife she is very pleased with this car | All the extra features it has is great | This car is well built | I have a family of four and it sometimes got very tight in our last vehicle but with the amount of space inside this one it is great | The remote ignition starter is great too | I am now back in Iraq finsihing up my tour and all I can think about is my family and this great car we bought | Thank you Chevy | 
 "words": So far so good | Fuel economy with mixed driving 20 | 6mpg | Hoped for better | Drives and rides great | Look forward to traveling this summer | 
 "words": I'm 6-3 270lbs and getting in and out of this vehicle is easy | V6 gets 20 on average and 23 highway | Plenty power and great in snow I have fwd | also you can get 4 large adults in with no problem lots of leg room | For the money this is a great vehicle | Also Chevy warranties are great | I | ve always been a Ford man and so far I have no regrets in switching I think Ford has been lagging the last few years | 
 "words": Only way to feel trans shifting is to watch tachometer | Has more get up and go than I figured when I bought the vehicle | The car's paint and finish are great | Used to own Fords but this baby is hot | Put on fender flaps a must to keep side panels dry | 
 "words": My husband and I decided to get something a little bigger than the 2 door Cobalt that I had since we travel a good bit | We decided on the Equinox and absoulty love it | We did not need anything extremely big since it is just the two of us but the room it has is great | This is my first SUV and I will never be able to drive a car again it drives like a car but is so much higher off the ground | So easy to get in and out | 
 "words": So far I love my Equinox | It's sporty and fun to drive | I can take the grandkids and all their stuff to their sporting events and yet I am comfortable driving it to a high profile meeting | 
 "words": Searched Through all the SUV crossover choices | It came down between The Toyota RAV4 Pontiac Torrent the Honda CR-V and Chevrolet Equinox won | Why | Best warranty best ride more power and all that with the best price | 
 "words": This was the last of the new cars I looked at in the price range I could afford and still be sporty looking | Very impressed with power | Reminded me of the surge in power of the 'muscle cars' from the '60's | I got the awd sport w 6spd trans | I'm reliving my youth | 
 "words": Only 1000 miles so far Satisfied to date | After I bought it I see more Nox on the road than I've saw before | A little thorn is with a vehicle of this size you would think that it would have better mpg as I do 60 hwy | Disappointed with the decrease in the driving range when the car idles | I hope this improves as it gets broken in | Maybe I'll have to shut the engine off at stop lights kind of what they do in Europe | 
 "words": This is my first SUV | Coming from a Mustang GT boss to this is a like a different world It is very easy to drive and doesn't even feel like your driving a small SUV | Overall it is a decent ride for the price | 
 "words": Bought the Equinox Sport just over a week ago and like it more and more | We traded an older Acura MDX for something that still had AWD good power and better fuel economy | All in all so far the suspension on the AWD Sport is stiff yet easily steerable the motor has plenty of power for the average Race-ready father and lots of interior room | I think the inside could be more refined but we are used to forein cars | The console and sun visor's seems chincy nice leather ample leg room like the gaugesand decent mpg if driven normally | We do 60 miles a day on the highway and the mpg is averaging 22 right now | This is not a Lexus or Acura but Chevy has done well and added options |
