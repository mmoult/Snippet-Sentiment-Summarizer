REVIEWS
 "words": 21 months later and 22k on the Camry we have had no problems and no regrets | Average mileage is 35 in town and up to 41 on road | Another reviewer complained about body dings | Buy the body side moldings we did | These should be standard | The best time to buy is at the end of the month or in our case the end of the year got an immediate 8 off sticker and a great for Lexus trade- in | 
 "words": For people who want a full-sized car but also want to be environmentally responsible this is for you | This is my first Toyota and after owning it for a year and a half I understand what others have been raving about | Driving around Pittsburgh where mountains abound I can still get better than 40 mpg while having plenty of room for three passengers three adults in the back is a little tight | Because the hills are steeper in town I actually get slightly lower in-town mileage low- to mid-30s | hybrids typically shine in town but it's still better than other vehicles I've owned by 10 mpg | I haven't had a single mechanical issue and have only done standard preventative maintenance | 
 "words": After an accident where an oncoming car spun out and into me I was thrilled and disappointed that it was our TCH that I was driving-we have two other Toyotas | The car did everything that it was designed to do | Only the airbags necessary deployed and the front end including hood crumpled as it was supposed to | I walked away with minor injuries | LOVE this car so much that when it was written off we bought a 2009 | It had more than 100000kms on it with no problems at all | Can't imagine a better vehicle | 
 "words": I love this car | I'm averaging 37-49 mpg in spring fall 35-37 in summer using A C and 30-33 mpg in winter when using heating elements and going faster than I should to keep mpg higher | It's true mpg is much lower in winter but it's the same as with my '99 Subaru Outback which averaged only 18-22 mpg AT BEST in winter | It seems engines work harder in winter to warm up the engine keep it warm also gasohol in winter doesn't help matters | I love the constant consumption energy etc | read-outs | This car helps you to learn how to save gas and operate it most efficiently | I was too uncomfortable in the Prius it was like driving a tin can but I bought the Camry instead | 
 "words": No problems with this car what so ever | They need to fix the door trim problem asap this car has more dings in the door then my 14 year old Camry | 
 "words": 3rd Camry 1st hybrid | We LOVE this car | It teaches you how to get more MPG | Passed on big nav stereo | Leather was well worth the | I can keep up with all traffic and stay at 40 mpg | Quiet roomy comfortable | Driver classes should consider this car | Power when needed | Consider trunk size when testing it works for us | CD player has trouble with home made cd mp3s | Patch in an iPod and go | Watch traffic and red-lights you CAN beat the stated MPG | We save money at every red-light the car is off | I have traveled over a mile on electric in town | This car gives all the data you need to make the most of your fuel | Toyotas are like spouses you may be tired of them before you wear them out | 
 "words": This is a great car but I live in New England | We were getting 35-38 MPG before winter | Now we are getting around 25 mpg | Our Suburban gets 16 mpg | I love our Camry but wonder if I would have bought it knowing the winter mileage is so much lower | We have a long winter and I wish I had known about the drop in MPG in the cold weather | By the way I researched this and it is a normal characteristic of all hybrids | 
 "words": I retired early | When I worked I drove 100 miles a day | We put an additional 10K miles on this car in a year | I think everyone in the family takes it to save gas | Other car is a BMW 330 convertible my last car was a Passat Wagon all wheel drive | 
 "words": Overall my 2008 Camry Hybrid is a good car but it has been in the shop three times for minor issues | First it was a defective gas cap then it was a defective seat belt latch next it was a defective power window button | The dealer needed to keep the car over night once and I was expected to rent a car | I was not happy | 
 "words": I've had my Hybrid since Feb 08 | I love it the gas mileage it is great | Around town I get around 36 mpg | We have went on 3 family trips the average trip was about 6 hour driving time | We got up to 44 mpg | The only thing I am disappointed with is the navigation system it is not user friendly at all | We had a Nissan before it was a lot easier to use | 
 "words": Bought this a year ago | Already owned Escape hybrid | Mileage is much better than advertised in mixed driving | Car has full package with leather heated seats sunroof Bluetooth nav etc | Nav not as user friendly to program as the 2002 Acura TL it replaced | Drives a little more bloated around curves like my 93 Taurus SHO but a very quiet solid ride | In the summer months 50-50 driving will net 39-40 mpg | cooler fall and winter 36 mpg | minor flaws are that the tire pressure maintenance sensor went goofy and some brake noise that Toyota will take care of | However for a 30K car loaded package it's well worth it over Prius | This is the best eco friendly sedan | 
 "words": I've had my Toyota for 8 months and the paint is chipping | Dealer won't do anything about it | It's up to the Toyota rep | Also I am very disappointed in the mpg | I'm lucky if I get 32 mpg and I drive more than the speed limit | Since the mileage was the main reason for purchasing the vehicle I'm sorry I bought it | The ride isn't the greatest but I can live with it | I can't live with a vehicle that is 8 months old that has paint issues nor the mpg for a hybrid | 
 "words": Great car and looks slick | The biggest beef with the car is the trunk and the lack of a big pass thru due to the batteries blocking the opening | The GPS is ok many off the shelf Garmins or TomToms perform better but it has definitely improved over previous versions of Toyota's GPS | It handles fine its not a sports car for sure but for basic driving its great and for long trips it is very comfortable when compared to my old mustang | Rear seating room is good even with normal size people in the front seats | Plenty of places to throw things with pockets all over

 "words": Prior to buying this car we had 2 SUVs that we probably put 12 -15k per year on each averaging 13 mpg | We bought this car to be a shared resource to offload mileage from both cars | THe goal fun sporty and comfortably seat our family accomplished on all | We all love the car | Sitting in the back with 2 kids I find it to be comfortable | THe car has plenty of zip | For us the only bad thing is we are a family of 6 | So when we all need to ride 20 of the time we need to hop back into the SUV | 
 "words": The Camry Hybrid is a good car it's our second hybrid | Our first was the Prius | Sorry to have to make comparisons but the trunk is the downfall on this car everything else is very good | The Prius trunk is about 30-40 bigger and even though we bought the Camry as our family car we find that we need to take the Prius on trips because the luggage would need to sit on our laps | Overall the car gets us 35 MPG and just marginally better than the 4 cylinder Camry that our friend owns | The trunk basically needs a one foot extention don't understand why Toyota didn't do this | Anyway if you are considering this car you must factor in that it has a VERY small trunk |

 "words": This car has been great | I was initially turned off by not being able to use the navigation while driving can't input a new address but the voice activated process allows you to input a new address | The car is extremely roomy and ergonomic and I love the heated seats and sound system | It is not a sports car so if you're looking for premier acceleration cornering etc | you've come to the wrong place | It is a good looking family car with more-than-ample acceleration while saving big money on gas | 
 "words": This car is a smart car | I have always known to not accelerate quickly or slam on the brakes abruptly but this car teaches me how to drive in order to maximize miles per gallon | In fact I have vastly improved gas mileage on my 97 4runner as a result | Could not decide between Lexus RX 350 this car | I have not regretted my choice | Lexus who | - If you are looking for a luxury car for at least 10-15k less Toyota Camry Hybrid is it | Way to go Toyota |

 "words": I traded a Tacoma 4x4 17 mpg for this hybrid | I no longer need a truck and I couldn't be happier with the Camry Hybrid | It' been cold here but I'm still averaging 36 | 5 mpg | I couldn't be happier | 
 "words": I traded in my low-mileage garage-kept 2003 Buick LeSabre Limited for the Camry Hybrid due to the fact that I drive in a mostly urban environment and out of fears of soaring gas prices | The trunk is much smaller than the Buick's but I still have my minivan for the big stuff | My only complaint about the vehicle is the poor quality of interior materials which deliver their own 'symphony' of sounds until the cabin warms up | I expected better in a Toyota | Overall I am happy with my purchase and would do it again |

 "words": Purchased my '08 Camry Hybrid in late '07 | Previously drove a Honda Pilot with nav | Cannot live without the navigation would not consider any car without it | The 2008 toyota camry hybrid navigation system is completely useless | There is NO ability to program or reprogram the navigation system unless fully stopped | Old models had overrides but no more | This dirty secret will soon be well known and poof goes any value for the nav on re-sale which by the way for me will be within two years | This is a huge problem and not how the majority of these systems work | 
 "words": After looking at cars and trucks I decided to take the plunge with a Hybrid | I drive typically 45 miles one way to work and needed something to help with the cost with gas | After leaving a V6 03 Accord I love the Camry | It has enough power for me and I cannot believe all the bells and whistles it comes with as standard | If you can spare the extra I would recommend the nav to experience the extra input on gas miles | Also love the quiet ride when the engine has not picked up yet but even as it kicks in it is very quiet | Driving in Cleveland with cold weather below 32 last week so waiting for MPG to go up | getting around 33 | Best was 38 MPG |

 "words": I am a DC commuter and purchased this car primarily to have access to the HOV lanes on days when I don't have a carpool | With a 40 mile one-way commute in sometimes heavy traffic average mpg for the first 1500 miles has been 35 | 5 | I will say that this car is a phenomenal deal for the money | Being accustomed to driving higher-end performance cars we weren't really expecting that much out of the Camry other than a more economical means of transport that gives to us flexibility in getting in and out of the city | However we have been absolutely truly impressed | The Camry has great acceleration and handling the ride is very smooth and the fit and finish quality is truly noticeable |

 "words": I love this car but I have used it mainly for city driving with a long shallow upwards grade when I go north and a lot of stops and it is a struggle to keep mileage above 30 MPG | I have read and written to innumerable folks who have a similar experience | The problem is the combo of a cold engine short trips complete stops and moderate hills | I am learning better how to coast more and this improved things and I recently got almost 50 MPG in my commute when I went south down | But in the city particularly in the cold it is certainly not a given that the mileage will be in the 35 MPG range | I have only 800 miles on it so maybe things will improve | But I second all other raves here | 
 "words": I test drove several hybrids before settling for the Camry and what won me over was the handling the ride and the smooth transition from gas to electric | I currently have about 2900 miles on my Camry and have even taken it on a road trip and my fuel average is 39 | 9 miles per gallon | Much better than the EPA estimate for the 2008 model | Coming from a VW suv that got 16 | 5 mpg this is a god send since the prices of gas keep rising | I got the fully loaded Camry with leather and navigation | This is the best car I have ever owned | Thank you Toyota

 "words": The beauty of the transition from gasoline to hybrid is the relationship between human and machine | Toyota engineers have created an intimate auto-feedback system that reinforces listening to the car and reading the mpg rather than the speedometer | The Camry's gas pedal must be finest tuned gas pedal ever created | This car is designed to float not drive | Accelerating up to speed as fast as possible and then backing off the gas pedal makes the mpg needle fall below 60 if you're in the 40-45 mph range | This is so satisfying | I love turning off the car and getting my props for having acheived 40 mpg | Camry hybrid is a wonderful ride and drive |
