REVIEWS
 "words": This car is fun | Great performance | The power is there when you need it | The handling is great | The braking is great | Above all you feel safe in this car | I have no complaints about quality | It's all built in | I'm holding on to this one | It's the first of my future collection | 
 "words": Great car sound system is great great acceleration | I'm glad the Premium package I for 2009 has bluetooth since I live in CA | Great improvement | 
 "words": First convertible and I love it | Really wanted a metal top but wound up trading our 2005 E320 4-matic for the rag top at the dealership | Liked the SLK metal top but felt it was too selfish with only 2 seats but have never used the back seats | 
 "words": Just a great car | Performance is amazing handling is excellent without sacrificing too much ride quality and the brakes are phenomenal | I bought the car 4 months ago and am averaging 18mpg pretty good for 5 | 5l V8 | Bizarrely this is better mileage than I got from my 2005 C320 | My only complaint is that sometimes the transmission gets confused especially if flooring the throttle at around 20-25mph | There is a noticeable lag before things start happening | Also watch it in the rain it will spin the rear tyres at 70mph under full acceleration | 
 "words": Having owned several performance Mercedes over the yrs including the SL series the CLK 550 is proving to be the best road machine I have ever driven | Mechanics wedded to aesthetics | 
 "words": This is a great car | I moved up from an Acura CL-S so it was an upgrade on all fronts | The acceleration is silky smooth | For the most part the engine is quiet but still can let out that great sounding growl when you really jam the pedal | There's no cooler sound than rolling through a short tunnel and hitting the gas just before the mouth It's like a sonic boom | Mine is fully loaded with the P3 package and just about every option available | I think the P2 package is enough though and you don't need silly options like the automatic trunk opener closer | 
 "words": I traded in my 2007 SLK that I had purchased new in March of 2007 | It was a nice car but tight on space and not very comfortable | The CLK Cabriolet is fantastic | The seats are the most comfortable I have set in | even better than our 2008 Lexus LS 460 | The Harmon Kardon stereo is incredible | The ride is crisp yet smooth and it literally glides over the roads | Some of the speakers vibrated at first with any significant bass but this seems to have subsided quite a bit | The Irridium Silver paint is beautiful in lower light or artificial light but in sunlight you see the problems with the metallic paint | looks like it was painted with a spray can | Moral don't buy on a cloudy day | 
 "words": My very first convertible and what a beauty | We actually had the opportunity to drive with top down in January during an unusual 70 degree day in New Jersey and it turned heads | 
 "words": I had owned numerous BMWs and bought a new 2008 Lexus LS460 recently | I traded in a 2007 Mercedes SLK on this 2008 CLK to have more room and comfort | This car is so far ahead of the competition that its not even funny | The seats are amazingly comfortable | The top operation is flawless | The interior design and comfort exceptional | The Irridium Silver paint seems a bit splotchy in bright light | The ride quality is excellent | The handling is tight much better than that of the SLK | I am very impressed with this car | A
 "words": This limited production car is truly a unique experience | The acceleration is impressive but the handling is the vehicle's true standout | The individually adjustable coil-over suspension allows one to not only adjust the ride height but also the compression and the rebound of the shocks to tailor the handling to your individual taste | The AMG Performance Studio really outdid themselves when the produced this wonderful example of their capabilities |

 "words": This coupe will turn you into a racecar driver | IT has the same engine as the S class with a fraction of the price | This car really has it all from it's 8 cyinder engine to it's body sculpted desing that has AMG written all over it | When night arrives is when the fun begins | It's very spacious cabon has all the bells and whistels to make your drive extremely fun | Whether you are looking for nav keyless go heated seats this car has it all | I will have to agree with Mercedes Benz quote | In a perfect world everyone would own one | Moreover not everyone is going to agree with me but that is the people who does not own one | As having a great affinity for cars especially coupes this one has it all
