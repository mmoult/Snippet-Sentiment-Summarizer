REVIEWS
 "words": This vehicle is not something you are going to want if you are looking for the drive of your life but if you're looking to have an economical vehicle that looks pretty good then this is the one for you | I did have a couple proplems with some of the features when I first got my car but Ford was more than happy to fix those up for me | All in all this is probably on of the best cars I've owned | I enjoy the smill I have every time I fill up my gas tank | 
 "words": I purchased the hybrid solely because of the price of gas | approaching 5 gal | I was driving a Tahoe Z71 that had a 25 gal | tank that I had to fillup every 5-6 days | I came from a Cadillac to a geo | When I accelerate up a hill it sounds like a cheap sewing machine | unbearable | The interior carpet and leatherette seats are cheaply made | I had to brake quickly the other evening and slid sideways | No traction | 
 "words": The Ford Escape Hybrid does not only get great mileage for a SUV but also has very low pollution emissions | I like the styling and don't feel I compromised on any factors when I bought it | I have kept a spreadsheet of actual mileage and have maintained an overall 31 mpg | The worst case mileage is log distance highway driving at 70 mph when my FEH got 28 mpg | Around town and using hypermiling techniques I have gotten 35 mpg | 
 "words": I bought this for the boss to replace a mini-van we outgrew | We wanted to downsize but not give up comfort and the ability to haul stuff from time to time | Oh yes we wanted to use less gas as well | The Escape Hybrid did all these things for us | It gets a consistent 30MPG which certainly meets our expectations | We have not had any trouble with it whatsoever | Frankly I didn't expect it to be this good but Ford so far has exceeded my expectations with regard to reliability | As an engineer I appreciate and respect this as a technological achievement | The shop manuals for it have been enlightening and entertaining | To the boss it's push this to go | this to stop | It works for both of us | 
 "words": It was the price that got us in the door | Then it was the vehicle and good salesmanship that kept us there | We drove our Escape Hybrid from Spearfish to Rapid City and we knew that we had made the right decision | My wife says It is quiet relaxing like Grandmom's Studebaker | 
 "words": When I bought my FEH in May 2007 I was looking for a more economical replacement for my Hummer H2 that I absolutely loved that is until I had to feed it | I was spending 600 900 per month on fuel and could no longer justify that expense | I did not want to buy the 4WD FEH initially until I could determine whether I could be happy in the pint sized replacement | I purchased the 2008 FEH FWD and to my absolute amazement it surpassed my expectations in every way | It not only delivers 2 | 5 to 3 times the gas milease I was getting in my H2 but it had more cargo space and great acceleration | From my home in Dallas I regularly get 32 37 MPG driving to and from Austin | 
 "words": I purchased my Escape after having to finally get rid of an 11-year-old Crown Vic | I wanted something that we could take camping and that would be safe comfortable to travel in but that would get good fuel economy in the city | I have not been disappointed with my choice | The car is easy to drive | Since it is a hybrid that depends on braking to recharge the battery it tends to get better gas mileage with long slow stops at least that's what I've noticed | I thought that going from a V8 to the hybrid would be a shock but this vehicle really has some get-up-n- go | The seats are easy to move and clean and I've never had any engine trouble | 
 "words": Took delivery of FEH in 6 24 08 | The moment I drove it home I knew this was a keeper | It has plenty of power and yet it gets good mileage | I get about 6 | 7 lt 100 KM in a small town and 7 | 1 on the highway | It is quiet in electric drive stealth mode | We bought an upscale model with most of the toys including the AWD | The ease of getting in out is also a plus | The front leather seats are very comfortable | Interior lighting gives it a classy look at night | The ownership to date has been a pleasure | It is a bit disconcerting at first when the engine shuts down in traffic | I don't mind when the ECON switch on shuts down the AC in traffic I can take a litle heat I just thnk about the gas | 
 "words": I've had the vehicle for about 6 months | Bought the top-of-the-line and enjoyed it very much | It looks good get great mileage 31 average | About a month after I bought it it would start | Turned out there was a loose wire in the built in security system Last week wrench light went on | Had to have a vent to cool the batteries replace | Hope this isn't a sign of things to come | 
 "words": I drove a BMW X5 4 | 4 for five years prior to trading for the Escape Hybrid | Gas prices were part of my decision and I honestly wanted to be one of the voices clamoring for Detroit to get with the program and invest in alternative powertrains | I loved the build quality and engineering excellence of the BMW | I expected that switching to a more pedestrian Ford was going to be full of compromise | Certainly the finishes are less luxurious recycled plastic instead of leather dash fewer adjustments in the seating etc but overall I have been quite satisfied | If I had it to do all over again I would do it all over again | 
 "words": I love the idea of a hybrid SUV and I am happy to buy American I have had my new Ice Blue Escape I call her Sky for about a month and I am getting about 35 | 5 MPG | I am a high mileage driver and was driving a 2002 Explorer and getting about 15 MPG | That was my 2nd Explorer | I am dissapointed at the hardness of the center console and the arm rests | The leather is a little stiff and I have a rattle in the center console where it meets the dash | My biggest concern is a rather loud noise in the back hatch that appeared after I drove on a slightly rough road in the 2nd week | It seems to be coming from inside the door near the Ford emblem | I don't want to accept this or get used to it | 
 "words": I will echo much of the positive remarks about this vehicle although the one thing that is inconsistent between reviewers is mileage | In New England the weather is so variable by season that I actually charted my mileage for each fill up | In winter months with heat and electric seat heaters I could get 22 24 mpg | In the spring I shot back up to 30 mpg | Max mileage reached was 31 | 5 and that was only 3 times | The economy mode button helps by cutting out the engine at traffic lights so blowers will still work but not AC or heat | That's ok for short pauses | The one thing inconsistent is the HEV or hybrid display of mileage it is always higher than reality by 1 | 5 2 | 5 miles | 
 "words": We have owned our 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid for almost one year | It has been a great car | We have had no problems with it of any sort | I had a good test of the AWD last winter when traveling a lonely state highway in a full-on snowstorm | There was 3-4 inches of snow on the road and the Escape handled it beautifully | The Highway Partol closed the road right after I made it through due to other vehicles involved in accidents | Our milage is a very consistent 27 to 28 MPG whether city or highway | In very hot weather the city mileage drops if the A C can't be kept in the economy mode | If the A C is not in economy the gas motor runs all the time | Great car | Buy it if you can find one | 
 "words": I bought my Escape Hybrid AWD in March 2007 shortly after they came out | I have averaged 31 MPG with this vehicle driving 80 city 20 highway | I couldn't be happier with this SUV | I am impressed by the improvements in ride and road noise I own a 2001 Escape as well | The fit and finish have been great and it just right for both my 4' 11 wife and my 6'2 self | I live in Colorado it has done very well in the mountains and the power of the 133 HP 4 cylinder backed up by the electric motor is equivalent to the V6 gas Escape I have | I think this vehicle is well worth looking at if you are considering a hybrid SUV and you have a small family 2 kids like my self | Ford has done a nice job | 
 "words": I purchased my 2008 last summer and have no regrets | We've had the orange wrench light come on a few times though | Although there were no observable problems they had to replace cooling fans motors etc | I suspect the system detects potential problems quickly | I get around 37MPG in winter and 33MPG in summer with AC running most of the time Tucson AZ | There's a squeak sound coming from a motor somewhere | It sounds like a clutch engaging disengaging | They repaired it once by replacing the AC motor but it has returned | I'm due for my 20k soon so I'll have them check it at that time | 
 "words": Leather Interior needs to be more comfortable but overall this is a great vehicle and will buy another one | Very reliable and gas mileage is great even with my lead foot | Finally the US automakers have something to be really proud of | Over 21000 miles of hard driving and no problems | Highly recommended | 
 "words": I ordered the Escape with all options and it arrived in 3 weeks | The quality is excellent | If only it had stearing wheel controls for the radio and navigation system | It is somewhat distracting to take your eyes off the road to change radio stations or enter a new destination on the nav system | Other than that the Escape is a great vehicle | Leather seats are comfortable and the interior is very well dressed up | Rear seats fold nicely flat | Plenty of room for 4 people and luggage for a week in the rear | Tires are quite and smooth but the continental tires are not good in the winter | Goodyear tires would be a much better choice | 
 "words": I was determined to buy a hybrid and I guess I was lucky to get one but I had to pay a premium for it | I am not sure it was worth it I think you give up quality in other areas | I will have to say that the quality is no where near as nice as the Expedition I had prior | Some of the interior and exterior portions of the car are cheap plastic and scratch very easy | have a fully loaded model except for the navigation system | I am getting about 25 miles to the gallon but if you like to stay cool during the summer months forget driving in electric mode the one thing they don't tell you is you won't go electic with the AC on even in econ mode | 
 "words": The Escape Hybrid has surpassed my '71 Firebird as the coolest car I've ever owned | It's great to have the load capacity of an SUV on the same gas mileage as the Camry Hybrid | Driving this vehicle is a fun challenge to see how efficient you can be | Technique definitely matters no jackrabbit starts coast as much as possible avoid excessive speed and you'll see 32-33 mpg without a problem | I live in South FL and so far no problems with the a c on economy mode | car stays cool with the fan recirc | air | I did a lot of research before buying | Settled on this vs | Camry Hybrid equivalent in style fuel economy due to max | tax credit lower price better load capacity | 
 "words": I am so happy I bought this car | I traded in my BMW X5 and year later I know I made the right decision | I am getting about 35mpg vs the 10mpg in the X5 | I highly reccomend this car | I also got a 4000 tax credit from the IRS for purchasing a hybrid vehicle | The dealership doesn't want you to know that because they are trying to sell the non-hybrid versions | If you have to have an SUV this is a great truck | 
 "words": 3789 miles and averaging 30 mpg with awd drive model | No problems what so ever | Interior could use some more padding on door arm rest and drivers seat could use more adjustment for tall drivers | I highly recomend the car | also a bigger battery so the hybrid could run more on battery
 "words": It is everything I wanted and I feel so good about helping the environment | The mileage is still improving at 29 | 8 MPG | I have 4x4 for winter and offroad driving and the features are top shelf | 
 "words": We ordered our Escape and had to wait 1 week for delivery loaded has everything possible | Sleek Black w Chrome trim | Love the drive roomy inside and good gas mpg | Traded in Ford Eddie B | Escape and transition to Escape is seemless only difference is Escape is much easier to drive easy to steer and manuever and park | Best decision I made in a long time | 
 "words": I absolutely love this vehicle | It gets great gas mileage for an SUV about the same as my 06 Hyundai Accent which is a really small car | It's fun to see how much gas you can save | I love the sun roof and how much it brightens up the cabin | I only wish it had the navigation | The exterior is stylish and it's a small SUV with a big look | Best car I've ever purchased | I'll probably get another when this one dies | I hated Ford vehicles before this now I think Ford is great | 
 "words": Excellent gas mileage | I have averaged 35 mpg since purchase | Very comfortable and quiet | Love the amount of stuff you can carry in it | It has been great | 
 "words": I have had this SUV for over a year now | Took it to Las Vegas in May averaged 26 mph going and 27 on the return trip over 4000 miles | Driving to and from work which is a 27 mile round trip I get 34 mpg well over the 29 mpg on the sticker | On the downside in the winter I was only getting 25 mpg when it was below 30 degrees | I have not had any problems just take it for oil changes | The book says every 10000 miles but I do it every 5000 | Would buy it again | 
 "words": I love this vehicle I traded a Chevrolet Suburban especially the gas mileage | It rides smoothly has good torque for passing and merging and is a pleasure to look at in the driveway | I miss the room of my Suburban but not the terrible gas mileage 14-15 MPG | The one thing that I don't think was engineered well is the rear hatch and glass | It rattles and is not sound proofed well at all | Also the door windows could have used better guides they rattle in the door when you close it if they are not rolled all the way up | Other than those two minor gropes this vehicle is designed well and built with quality workmanship | I would definitely buy it again | 
 "words": I have been watching the Escape Hybrid since it came out in 2005 | I have read a lot of reviews and knew to wait until after 1000 miles to check MPG | Also have read enough to know that cold weather drops MPG but that is the cost of living someplace cold | I set the cruise on my 35 minute highway drive to work at 70 for the first month and averaged 32 | 5 MPG | Second month I set the cruise at 65 and it jumped to 34 | 5 | Add in the city driving and I get around 35 | 5 | I had to rush home one day and it really does move like a V-6 when you stomp on it | I rode in a 2006 a few times before and again after buying mine and the 2008 is quiet | Engine rev noise only when it is working real hard
 "words": The Escape is a blast to drive | It feels nimble solid and sure and the acceleration is remarkably good | After 8500 miles we're averaging 32 mpg on the highway and between 32 mpg my wife with a heavy foot and 38 mpg me with an exceptionally light foot in town | 
 "words": The utility of this crossover is wonderful | It is not as fuel-efficient as the Prius but is much larger both inside and outside | Guests find the back seat comfortable with good viewing | I like the blue instrument lighting the center-stack the lighter interior colors and tinted windows | It handles extremely well in the city and is large enough on the highway for a sense of safety | The 2 | 3 engine sometimes seems a bit underpowered and louder than it should be | The workmanship on my vehicle is excellent | I don't regret that I bought a 300 Garmin Nuvi instead of the 2500 built in GPS | In summary The Escape Hybrid doesn't get the media attention it deserves | 
 "words": I've driven Explorers and 1 Mountaineer since '94 about 600000 miles altogether you might say I liked them | This is definitey the next thing | I'll admit to driving around 70-75 mph far more than the cops would like and am getting 28 | 3 29 | 7 mpg | It's very comfortable and I love driving a hybrid and still have awd 4 seats and doors some cargo space an actual suv y'know | -I think hope that Ford'll notch things up a bit in the next couple model years | Mine will kill the engine and then restart it 10 sec later or even less | regularly | You it must start the engine to use the car | In this century all cars need locking fuel doors actually they always should have had them
 "words": In cold weather I was getting down to 19-21 in city driving 26 on highway | Never got over 24 in city and I drove this by the textbook | Took off slowly to stay in electric mode people honked a lot at me on slow take off from lights | I chose fwd to save fuel slipped all the time in the least amount of snow got stuck twice in snow when other fwd cars drove by me | Then I read it has no traction control | The heavy battery in back throws off the weight balance advantage of fwd | Very frustrating experience | You in cold weather states need to beware | I traded to escape 4 cyl fwd and similar mileage in cold temps and no slippage in snow maybe ok in warm states | Not worth the extra for hybrid | 
 "words": It took me long time to hunt down an Escape Hybrid but it was worth the wait | Got the color and the options I was looking for | I live in south florida and it is giving me around 34- 35 mpg | I mostly drive in the city and not much highwaqy | The audio system and the navigation system is awesome | I liked the exterior of Mercury Mariner but that is even harder to get than the Escape | 
 "words": Mountain driving with 26-27mpg | Smart AWD system works better than my Jeep's system | Comfortable heated leather seats and easy to use dashboard controls | Driver visibility and ride height higher than other SUVs | Could not justify the extra cost for the Toyota | Durability remains to be seen for my Ford track record is not good | Good crash test results but not the best | Handles great in deep snow | Perfect for a family of 4 and winter gear in the back for a weekend in the mountains | 
 "words": Seemed hard to get a Escape Hybrid but it was well worth the wait after ordering it | Absolutely love driving it and watch the MPG display show 33 MPG | Love the body style and the interior is very well designed | I couldn't be happier with this purchase | 
 "words": I did my research and this vehicle stood out as far as looks and supposed mileage | I really love it in general | Very smooth ride and fun to drive though the braking system takes some getting use to | I am however very disappointed in the mileage | I consistently get 25mpg MAX after 1200 miles | From the other reviews this is very low | I have a friend with a 2006 that gets over 30 has from the beginning | I don't know if I have a lemon but Ford will not even hear about mileage issues until 10000 miles | Even though 25 is good for a SUV it's not that much more than my Explorer | And I'm driving very conscientously | I recently drove a rented Charger that got this mileage | 
 "words": I own and my kids drive an '02 Yukon XL | '02 Honda AWD CRV | '05 Vibe | '06 Vibe | '05 Escape AWD XLT and now the '08 Escape Hybrid AWD | I love all of my cars and now the Hybrid Escape is great to drive in all weather but gets gas mileage like the Vibes | I really like the build and quality of the '05 Escape and the '08 Hybrid is just that much better plus it is the perfect size now that my 4 kids are moving out of the house | The Hybrid is our around town car and the Yukon is our car when all 6 of us need to take a road trip | So far the Hybrid is everything I was looking for and I am very happy | BTW I also considered an '08 CRV and the '08 Santa Fe but went with the Escape | 
 "words": I bought this car kinda unexpected | I was walking around the cars while having my 06 Focus worked on | And I ran across the car | I test drove it | and have been in love since | We have the leather interior | I have never had that in any car | and love it | The car rides perfectly | I am avg about 34mpg in the city | and Don't do a lot of hwy driving but when I went one state up it was roughly 26mpg | Hybrid's aren't made for hwy driving | I don't have a lot of the extras But I love it just the way it is | I was always a Mustang person But now I will never not own a Escape | 
 "words": We were able to purchase one of the first 2008 Escape Hybrids out for 2008 and have found if a great vehicle for us | We are averaging about 26 | 7 miles per gallon that includes both highway and in town driving every day | The satellite and GPS system are worth the extra money and make driving that much more enjoyable | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle a few weeks and so far I am very happy with what I got for the money spent | The items that are noted as cons in the Edmunds review do hold true but are not that big of deal in looking at the vehicle overall | I think the Escape handles well for an SUV and I enjoy driving it | The interior is nice and the cab is fairly quiet except when the engine is excellerating | I have only filled the tank on this vehicle 3 times so far | The first time I got 26mpg and the last two times I got 30mpg | This is a combo of freeway and city driving | I even drove it up the steep hills of San Francisco with three adults in it and still got 30mpg with good power | 
 "words": I love this car | I drove a Ford Explorer 2 door prior to this car and I have more driver room in the Escape | I am 6'7 and love the room in this car | I loose a slight amount of vision on the side because the seat goes back so far | The gas mileage is great | My only concern is that the materials for the dashboard controls seem a bit fragile and I wonder how they will hold up in the long run | 
 "words": I read all the reviews drove most vehicles in this SUV truck market and bought the escape because of the mileage and tales of better performance | I'm not getting it only 25 mpg | I'm here to tell you buy a Toyota Highlander IF you live out west and travel faster then 60 you want more cargo space and a better interior with more convience or you have anything to tow or haul | The 4 cyl gas engine and weak electric just don't cut it it has to run at too high RPM's above 60 mph to deliver the mileage | in Montana the limit is 75 | Last trip at that speed I got 22 mpg | Very disappointed | Everything else I read about it both good bad has been listed by others | especially plug it in | 
 "words": I traded my 01 Escape for and 08 Escape Hybrid and I'm loving it | I'm averaging about 32mpg | The engine turning off and going to electric takes some getting used to because it feels like your car has stalled | It also took some getting used to not having the power of the v6 but the car does great for the size and only being 4cyl | It's roomy enough for 2 children in the back | Blind spots are not that bad for a suv | Tons of storage space and little cubby spaces | Not that many out there so it was hard to find the color I wanted | black | This car makes my wallet happy 
 "words": My wife picked the color Kiwi Green | I traded in my F250 4x4 for this pip sweek | I haven't turned back yet | We get consistent 34 MPG and have achieved 50 MPG on backroads average speed 25 MPH | I would like to see more driver features to affect fuel economy like electric only from the line | I use mine mostly for | 5 to 1 mile trips just in time to get to electric | Also a plug in option would be nice | Hats off to all those supporting this awesome technology of regenerative braking | 
 "words": I cannot believe I have the good fortune to own this beauty | I waited over 3 months but it was way worth it | This may be the best vehicle Ford has ever designed and built | It's comfortable controls are intuitive and well laid out documentation is excellent and that sweet silence when you come to a stop is sublime | Most impressive is how much roominess is built into the interior for a small suv | I couldn't be happier or more impressed | 
 "words": I now have over 8500 miles on this car since June '07 including several 400 mile trips | Gas mileage has been better than advertised averaging over 34 miles per gallon composite city and highway driving I do drive with economy in mind and have filled my tires with dry nitrogen which also helps economy | The ride remains very smooth comfortable and tight | Acceleration when required is good | Handling is quick and nimble that doesn't make it a sports car though and there is still no sign of tip-up while cornering | This vehicle continues to be everything I had hoped for and more thank you Ford for making it available and please build more hybrids for us e | g | a Ford Fusion Hybrid | 
 "words": I have never owned a Ford a hybrid or a kiwi green vehicle before | I am very impressed | I love this SUV | We are going to get a 3000 rebate from the government so getting this vehicle was a no brainer | We also looked at a Toyota Highlander and for 10000 less the Escape was the best bang for the buck | The interior is roomy SUV has good handling and I love the kiwi green color | The hybrid is so quiet that the SUV sounds like the engine is off | I am getting 32 mpg in the city and 30 mpg on the highway | It has a very smooth ride and so far I would recommend this SUV to anyone | Be prepared to wait 8 to 12 weeks if you order one | but it is worth the wait | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle for almost 2 months and have put 3300 miles on it | Milage has been as advertised about 29 mpg on the highway and 30 in town | I have learned to coast into stop signs and traffic light so that the electric engine takes over | After trading a F-150 pick up truck for this SUV I feel as if I am driving a sports car | 
 "words": This is a great little SUV | The hybrid system is awesome having fun trying to see how many MPG's I can acheive | 
 "words": I bought my Escape Hybrid because I commute 70 miles each way to work over mountains so I needed good MPG and reliability in bad weather conditions | I've put about 8300 miles on it in a little over 2 months | MPG is good but it is so much better in the city | I'm getting about 28 avg on interstate with mountains which is still awesome for a FWD | Also I am making an attempt to save the environment | That's really the best part | I love the interior and exterior is fresh and bold from the old style | I need the electrical outlet to use my laptop while I am working so I have gotten a lot of use from that | I like it more and more |

 "words": Just a couple 100 miles on it now getting better than the EPA sticker so far | Due to weight savings lots of plastic interior feels a little cheap | Front grille came loose off the 1st week and needs to go back to dealer | Coming from a Volvo XC90 the Ford ride is lighter peppier feels like a V6 way less room | Don't expect to fit 3 child seats in the back seat | We can barely fit a car seat a booster and our 6 year old in a seatbelt it's very cramped back there | Zero cargo room | Without NAV system so all hybrid info is on the dash near odo | The 3 hybrid info buttons are in a bad spot to the left of the wheel should be on the steering wheel | Stereo climate buttons are confusing | 
 "words": About 6000 mi so far | 30 | 5 mpg on recent drive CT to FL AC on all the way | Ford needs to build more of these keep size the same keep refinning go plug in to increase mileage | Very quiet interior and roomy | Love it | 
 "words": I have had my FEH for nearly 3 months now | I absolutely love it | I had a 2005 gas Escape but traded in when a job change made a big dent in my fuel economy | I love that I can still drive at highwa speeds and yet the engine just sips gas | Although it has been an adjustment to go from a V6 to a little 4 cylinder but the electric motor kicks in when needed | I'd highly recommend the FEH to anyone looking for a good sized high ground clearance vehicle that gets great gas mileage | At 4000 miles I'm averaging 34 | 5 MPG | 
 "words": The Escape Hybrid for 2008 is an extrememly smart buy | I have a 2004 Acura TL that I was using for my commute every day 120mi round trip | Since I bought the Escape I barely drive the TL anymore and I am saving almost 300 bucks a month | That more than pays for the car payment | There are some very minor annoyances in the design | While the audio is first rate there are no audio controls on the steering wheel definitely a design oversight |

 "words": I recently purchased this vehicle after reading a number of positive reviews on various internet sites but quite honestly this vehicle is very average | Overall build quality is below Honda and Toyota | Performance is very average in terms of accelerationnoise etc | Vehicle feels very loose on the highway | Gas mileage has been good | as advertised | Beware if you drive in a warm weather region because the air conditioning compressor shuts off at stops and when the car is running on the electric motor only | If you are in a traffic jam on a 90 degree day you are in for a painful ride | Also beware the the 3000 tax credit may not apply if you make six figures and utilize the AMT 
 "words": We bought the Escape hybrid when our previous vehicle incurred expensive repairs | We are absolutely amazed with the pep comfort and fuel economy of this vehicle | It is an outstanding vehicle that has exceeded our expectations | We are averaging about 28mpg on both hyway and around-town | Our hybrid has satellite nav and a bunch of other options and only lacks memory seats | Not sure if the memory seats are available | but we bought the only hybrid on the lot | Next time we will look for memory seats not a big requirement | We recomment this vehicle highly | We will probably replace our Jeep with an Escape Hybrid next year | 
 "words": Quiet except under heavy acceleration ecconomical and comfortable | I have put almost 2000 miles on the car and like it very much | I especially like the fuel economy and the comfort | In addition it is easy to park and handles well | We bought the vehicle for economy choosing it over the Toyota Highlander for both price and fuel economy | The Highlander is 5500 more on base price and has poorer fuel economy | In all everything feels tight is overall quiet and compact | I have not experienced any tip-up issues in cornering but I don't drive it like a car so I probably will not | My longest trip was 8 | 5 hours 420 miles | The car was very comfortable for the entire trip and averaged 38 MPG | 
 "words": We are very discerning car buyers | We have bought three new BMWs in the last 10 years have had two Chevy Suburbans and own a brand new Range Rover | We shopped for a hybrid partly because we were feeling guilty and have no affection for Japanese cars | The Ford Escape Hybrid is without a question a neat little vehicle | Both my wife and I are both enjoying it greatly | Does it have the finish of a Range Rover | No but it also costs about 50000 less and it uses a lot less gas | The Escape has a lot of pep | It darts around town as well as any car | And all the while we feel a little less guilty using it than we do when we are using our other cars | 
 "words": I replaced my 1995 Honda Civic with the 2008 Escape Hybrid | I thought I liked my car but driving the Escape I don't think I will ever go back to a car | The Escape Hybrid has more get- up-and-go than a regular 4 cylinder | The added oomph from the battery really helps acceleration | I am getting about 31 mpg freeway city driving | The transition was seamless but the more I drive the Escape I can tell when it switches although I sometimes think I am more in tune with a vehicle than other | The Escape fits my 6'4 husband comfortably unlike the Honda and the two kids have plenty of room in the back |
