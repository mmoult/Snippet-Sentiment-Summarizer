REVIEWS
 "words": I just had my Escape repaired yesterday for Bad Tranny Cooler from the dealer that I purchased it from | No questions asked they fixed at no cost stating it was under warranty | No complains on this end | 
 "words": Leaking transmission fluid at 56000 miles | Dealer found failure in transmission condensor | Internet search found many people having this failure with 08 Escape | Dealer says Ford will not cover this under powertrain warranty but the dealer will use Customer Loyalty Program to cut repair cost to 100 | Typical American car manufactured spend millions to advertise and tell us how good their product is and then find a way to weasle out of fully covering warranty work | Stay away from the 08 Escape | This is my 4th Ford vehicle but Toyota is looking very good at the moment | 
 "words": Purchased my Escape new and loved it I have had small problems with it | The tires are cupping on the inside | We rotate them when we take it in for service and Ford always tells us that we need new tires but never tells us what the cause is | Another company told us it was the suspension | I also know that the shocks or struts are having issues | When you go across a dip it has a bottom out feel | The vehicle has several rattles and the seats spot w o any reason | The black moulding around the outside windows raises up when you raise the window up and down and it won't stay down once up | 
 "words": After trying to find the good in it I have come up with nothing | I am a previous Toyota owner and I feel very short-changed by the Escape | The inside is very cheap | The apolstery irritates my legs shows every single water spot and the foam is hard as a rock | Overall the interior looks like a 6 year old designed it | When I am on the highway the engine noise makes it sound like a semi-truck from the inside | Also I know I have a 4 cylinder but I can't do more than 20mph uphill unless I gun it | Then at that point the engine sounds like it is going to fall out | They should not even make a 4cyl | I do like its auxilary jack for my iPod
 "words": Took my 08 escape in today and was told the ac condenser was broke and that was why my transmission fluid was leaking | Have an 8 year warrenty on this car and ofcourse this problem is not cover because it is not part of the drive train | So now its costing me 500 dollars to fix it plus 40 to be told what the problem is | I am not happy at all with ford if they know this is going on and not doing anything about it they are pretty much screwing us on purpose | I will keep my car but not sure I will buy another | 
 "words": A local auto repair shop just told me my 2008 Escape's transmission cooler is leaking and has been for a long time | Since purchased I've taken it to the Ford dealership where I bought it for servicing and they never mentioned this problem | This same dealership said the extended warranty expired 600 miles ago and they can't cover the repair | The dealership is asking almost 600 to repair it | I see other '08 Escape tranny cooler problems on this site | Ford needs to fix this problem | Though a loyal Ford customer for years I will no longer be buying a Ford if the company can't replace a repeatedly defective part | 
 "words": I purchased my 08 Escape new | I love my Escape but noticed that it was having a hard time taking off so it reved up and then slammed into take off mode | I took it in today and they told me that there was a leak in the intercooler leaking transmission fluid | And now I've read other reviews that say they have had the same problem | should there be a total recall should we all get new cars to replace these that are defective | I've only had my car 1yr and a half | 
 "words": I bought my escape a year ago | Have put extensive miles on it without any problems whatsoever | Only regular maintenance which is key to maintaining a vehicle | Will keep an eye on the tranny after reading these reviews | but other than that cute fun suv | 
 "words": Bought our 2008 Escape used with only 8000km on it | No real problems except bad gas mileage | The gas tank is too small and no matter how easy I drive this car I can't even get 500km on a tank | I should be at least getting 600km on a tank | Only had it in to the dealer for regular oil changes and one warranty problem | Has a whining sound now that I have to get checked | 
 "words": I bought my Escape in June of 2008 | I drove to Daytona Beach Florida from Mechanicsville Virginia and was ecstatic | Drove beautifully and the radio Sirius was great until they Sirius changed the channel lineup | However I have had the vehicle in the shop 3 or 4 times for a rattle in the back of the car | The dealer cannot find the problem and keeps giving it back to me and it keeps rattling | Other than that I am pleased with it | Does any body else have any rattles they cannot get rid of | 
 "words": Recently purchased this little SUV a replacement for my 05 Taurus | Great little truck love the driving position and pep from the V6 | Not quite as refined as my wife's CR-V EX-L | Decent gas mileage not much different than the Taurus | 
 "words": I bought my 2008 Escape XLT 3 weeks ago and am impressed | I traded in my 2006 Fusion and could not be happier | The ride is like a sedan fit and finish is great and the new look exterior says class | The satellite radio is way too much fun | The interior could use more padding but looks good | I have averaged 24 MPG for city driving and this alone is impressive | I can't wait everyday to hop in and drive | I have owned 20 cars in my life 16 new cars and this Escape ranks at the top | Thanks Ford | 
 "words": I turned in my 5 sp manual 98 Explorer Sport for the new 5 sp manual 08 Escape and I love it | The ride is comfy the gas mileage is great 22-28 mpg and best of all I can plug in my iPod | It is a fun and safe car to drive with plenty of room for my friends | It is a great car for road trips and vacations | 
 "words": I've had my Escape for just over 3 weeks now | I missed my 2002 Pathfinder at first but after the last snow storm the Escape won me over for good | Handled much better than my old SUV and has a lot more safety features that I wanted in a truck | Got the top line model love all bells and whistles | I have to say I love the satellite radio who knew it could be so much fun | Some issues I do have | heated seats turn off after 10 minutes and there is no temp control 4 speed trans doesn't cut it gas mileage is not that great- getting 19 mpg on the hwy so far heavy rain-water gets in the door and spills out the bottom once door is open- dealership says that normal but I have my doubts | 
 "words": Wanted to move into the SUV market from driving a Chevy Malibu | Drove the Mariner CR-V RAV 4 others | The Mariner seemed to cost more just for the Mercury label | The CR-V had a tight suspension and hit every bump hard | The RAV-4 had a cramped ride for everyone | After driving the EscapeI was comparing all the other vehicles to it | So Escape was my choice | 4WD wheel drive was a must for me with MI winters | The combination of that with the stability control and traction control make me feel safe and more in control of my own destiny | I am paying the same per fill up as I did with the Malibu but instead of going once every two weeks I am going once a week | So it doubled | 
 "words": I love this vehicle | I traded in my '04 Escape 2WD base vehicle that I absolutely came to hate after 2 winters | Don't buy a 2wd Escape if you get snow or ice weather | Spend the money and get the 4WD AWD you won't regret it | Since purchasing this vehicle I have driven in snow storms with confidence not over-confidence and it handles amazing | It grips the road and snow and sticks and I even tried to make the tires spin | It handles very smooth quiet on the highway is peppy | I find it comfy to sit in and drive | The gas mileage is good for an SUV and handles much like a car | The control panel takes a little getting used to since there are a lot of buttons but you get used to it | 
 "words": Needed something that could haul stuff and get me to work in New England winters fit small family for road trips and get reasonable fuel economy | The Ford Escape fit the bill | It is the first new domestic car my wife has owned | She drives it more then I do | We got the FWD modal | I am impressed with the traction on very icy and heavy snow covered roads | It is very quit on the highway | We have some good friends that almost bought a Honda CRV but decided on a GTI | They thought the Escape is a better buy | I would highly recommend this car | 
 "words": Just bought my 4WD XLT black pearl slate Escape and I love it so far | I live in Alaska where four wheel drive is a must and it handles great | Love the new exterior and interior over the old model | a definite improvement | 
 "words": My wife and I needed something that was more fuel efficient than the Tahoe we traded in | This little SUV has plenty of room inside for the two and some of the grandkids plus it's got plenty of pep when you press the gas | And it stills gets close to 21 MPG driving in town | We're very pleased with it | 
 "words": After gas prices went over 3 | 00 a gallon it was time to trade in the 2006 F150 V8 16-18mpg for something with better mpg | I use my vehicle for work and travel quite a bit so gas prices are very important | My 2008 Escape is getting 23-26 mpg and is saving me a bundle on gas | 
 "words": I bought my Escape in June and have 17000 miles on it already | I love the style and all the features outside and in | But | the brakes make this awful popping noise every time they get hot | I have taken it to the shop 5 times for repairs | The shop had replaced every bit of the back end yet they still pop | We brought it to the attention of the manufacturer and the engineers said this was a normal variation of the vehicle and it does not affect braking performance | Funny thing they can't identify what is making the noise so how they know it's not affecting brake performance | your guess is as good as mine | This is my first and last Ford | It's cute and roomy but I can't trust it will last | 
 "words": I intended to buy a used 2006 Escape but Hubby saw this one and was hooked | Has every available option from Ford | Very happy with that | Quick and snappy can park anywhere | Just a lot of fun to drive | Great sound system | We looked at mid-sized SUV's but decided we wanted something smaller and this fits the bill | Lots of power | Weather has been bad nearly since purchase and I drive in AWD a lot plus with zero degree weather or below longer warm up periods are required so I am not seeing the great fuel mileage people are talking about | 17 mpg I hope that chances with the weather conditions | Overall very pleased | 
 "words": Great looking car for the money | Drives great lots of room when 2nd row is folded flat | Great gas mileage for a gas only engine 26 mpg average | 
 "words": I just purchased my new 2008 XLT Escape last week and am loving it | The newer body style is what peaked my interest at first-not a huge fan of the older looks | I decided on a nicely loaded Escape over a standard Edge | I am very happy | The interior is different from what I've had in the past but took no time to get used to | I love the satellite | Very room and clean interior | Sunroof is nice and big | So far the FWD with traction has done well in some higher snow for me | The drive feels great and so far gas mileage is good | I love the convenience package features as well | I got the Kiwi Green color and absolutely love it everyone notices and likes it | I am very happy with my Escape
 "words": This is our second Escape got hooked on the interior roominess at 6'4 its a primary concern | Love the handleability of FWD in the ice and snow while still getting a smooth ride on dry roads | One complaint the cruise control creeps up in hilly interstate driving | Both of our Escapes can gain 3 to 5 mph when going up hill and then it stays there after cresting | Overall it's a great auto | 
 "words": I traded in my Escape 2005 for the new styled 08 | Escape just gets better in comfort ride quiteness handling and style | I have the moon roof w satellite Autophile Stereo and this is worth the upgrade | Concerned with the factory installed Continental Tires | Had them on 05' with alot of road noise | So far this is no issue | This Escape is just fun to drive and own | No complaints with either the 05' and now the new 08' | Thanks Ford | 
 "words": After having driven sporty cars last car a Mustang for most of my life and having read your review I was expecting something much more pedestrian than the Escape turned out to be | It was comfortable from the get-go handles very well and accelerates smartly | It is not choppy riding try comparing it to a Focus SVT | Friends have commented on how smooth the ride is and how comfortable the car is | The power steering is well-balanced but could do with a bit less assist | I do not find any problem with the braking nor with gentle acceleration | Fuel economy is decent not horrible but not super | In my case I use a gallon more fuel per week than I used to with my Mustang | 
 "words": I've had my Escape almost 4 weeks and have put on 2400 miles already | The ride is comfortable with lots of room for passengers | Gas mileage not too bad for a 6 cyl | I'm averaging 21 | 4 mpg and that is mostly highway driving | Traded my 2005 Outback miss the heated seats heated mirrors and lumbar support | 
 "words": So far we put over 6K miles on our 08' Escape | We absolutely love it | It has been the perfect replacement to our aged gas loving Astro van | Geting the EPA rated MPG | For a I4 FWD we have taken it to some bad roads and some mud and it handles it with no problem | It makes you fell like your in a Explorer | It's on the slow side with the I4 | We clocked it a around 10-11 | 5 seconds to 60 | We only had one problem | A weld in the gas tank | baffle broke and was causing an quite squeak | The dealer replaced it under warranty and gave us a free oil change in less then 5 hours | This car turned a GM family in to Ford buyers for life if we continue to be pleased | 
 "words": I am overall extremely impressed with this vehicle | I purchased it with every available option from ford and am not dissappointed at all | The GPS is amazing totally recommend Easier to use than Mercedes'non-touch interface | I have driven nearly 3500 miles and average around 20 MPG with the 6 Cyl | The only gripe that i have is with the Cruise control it average at least 2 Mpg less when it is on and varies greatly in speed up to 5-10 miles per hour | Other than that i love my espcape and personally believe that if Ford keeps up with producing vehicles to this build quality and overall solid feel while still appeasing to luxury tastes they will be fine | 
 "words": The interior is very slick with good utilities | Smooth ride | It is a family car with higher importance to safety rather than speed | Not to be used for street light racing | Fuel economy 25 MPG which is not very good as compared to foreign models | Price compitative to most foreign cars and almost 5000 less than a CR-V 
 "words": I've had my Escape a few weeks now love it drove everything rogue outlanderoutbackcompass etc | happy with my choice | I'm getting about 24 mpg on hilly terrain no hwy with the AWD that I can't live without where I am | Replaced an Outback this little suv is perfect | I love the camel interior much nicer than the stone | The 4cy | is pretty nice after you get used to the tranny it shifts funny until you develop a nack of driving it | There isn't a need for the 6cy | Never thought I'd go back to a Ford but my husband's new Ford diesel is so nice that it made me take a look at the Escape very glad I did | It is suprisingly roomy inside and the whole interior layout is very nice | 
 "words": I was looking for a small SUV that had a decent amt of cargo capacity excellent safety features good reliability 4wdleather satellite radio moonroof and of course I had to like the comfort looks and performance | I also wanted one made in USA but didn't want to pay more than 25K | I have found all of that and more in my 2008 Escape | Also pleased with gas mileage-20mpg combined | Very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely choose it again | 
 "words": I continue to be impressed with the look and feel of quality I percieve in this vehicle | I drove both the 4cyl and the 6 cyl and frankly didn't see that the difference in power was significant enough to justify the extra price or lower mpg of the 6 cyl | The interior a camel color is very well done and I like the Light Sage Clearcoat color of the paint as well | I live in a hot climate so light colors are best but I was very tired of white the green is a welcome change | The car is very quiet so far | 
 "words": The MPG in the city are great | 26 in the city and 32 on the highway | I am glad that I did not wait for a hybrid to come in and bought a 4cyl insted | 
 "words": Too quick to know exactly what happened but I wrapped my brand new Escape around an electric pole this week and am here to talk about it | '08 handled my 52 MPH head on like a champ | ROLL BAR In tact | AIRBAGS Deployed deflated quickly | NOT TRAPPED rear glass popped open giving me a quick escape route from the fire | WINDSHIELD Didn't shatter | Just a little crack in the corner | INTERIOR Still looked like new | Not even a little mark in the leather Impact did not send the motor in to the body cavity or my legs | ME | Didn't have jewelry on I would not have had a mark on me | This was not only a pleasure to drive and look at it was a damn good car | I will buy another | 
 "words": I love the Ford Escape | Had a 2006 Hybrid and traded it in because of high miles put on it | More interstate driving than I anticipated | I loved the hybrid | Have v6 now and love it | Easy to drive and park | New design with reduction of wind noise is another reason I traded | If I had the extra money I would have bought another hybrid when purchasing a 2008 model | 
 "words": I was waiting for a hybrid Escape but was not able to recieve it until maybe December which would have been 6 months | So I decided to get the 4cyl 2wd and it has been great | The average mileage all around has been 24mpg | The noise level is also a lot less then the original model | The 4cyl is plenty of horsepower for the car considering the V6 isn't that much more | 
 "words": I traded in my 2006 Ford Escape for the 2008 Ford Escape need I say more | Awesome vehicle | New body style gas mileage chrome interior exterior design etc | 
 "words": After buying 5-speed manual Honda cars for 30 years I decided to look at an SUV with a 4 cyl | 5-speed manual | Honda offered automatics only in the 4 cyl | so I looked at several other makes and the 2008 Escape was by far the best looking with many features that are standard | Cruise control and mag-type wheels were the only options I had to get | I love sitting up high and having all the cargo space | It is a dream to drive | Thanks Ford for offering the 5-speed manual transmission | 
 "words": We needed a vehilce with some soft roading ability better ground clearance and all wheel drive | I did not expect such a high level of options fit and finish and feel | The Escape is very comfortable and quiet and feels like much more vehicle than it really is that is until you need to park then it shows its size by making parking very easy | I am averaging 25 mpg | and getting 30 mpg on the highway and thats with only 700 miles on it | I can see why Ford has sold one million of these cars and with the new improvements should sell many more | 
 "words": I just purchased my beautiful Lt Sage Escape this past Monday and I am in heaven | Upgrading from a 01 Kia Sportage to this is surreal to me | The dealer made my purchasing experience totally problem free | I love everything about the Escape | I got the chrome package and I am enjoying the second looks My 5 year old son looks like a little prince in his back seat | The moonroof is awesome and the roominess is great | Being only 4'9 I feel so tall O especially when I adjust the seat | I really like the information center that tells you how many miles you have left before you get to E and the fact that the car lets you know when it needs servicing | I am sold on the Fords now O
 "words": I love this SUV | This is my first vehicle purchase | I was driving a '93 Suburban and this is a great improvement | Great gas mileage love the interior | Only problems I have had was I wasn't aware you needed to ask if a vehicle came with cruise control I just thought it was a standard feature | I mean it came with the Stability Control System but no cruise control | That would have been a selling point for me | Also I was sold the vehicle as a 6 CD player but it is only a single no biggie but why the need for a load button if you can only do one CD at a time | 
 "words": The wife and I traded in my awesome '05 Japanese sedan for an '08 Escape | We wanted more safety features ground clearance and comfort for a similar car payment | I thought I was sacrificing quality and performance but the Escape blew my wife and I away | We love driving it everywhere and get great comments from family members who own larger SUV's both foreign and domestic | I was used to the more powerful 2 | 5L from the sedan but a quick air filter change to a higher performance filter fixed me right up | 
 "words": My first SUV and I love it | It's roomy smooth and quiet ride nice display great sound system everything that I wanted plus more at a great price | Size looks bigger than it really is | I was eyeing the CR-V for 9 months and then looked at the RAV4 couldn't push myself into purchasing one | I think the 2008 Escape beats them both | The Escape was equipped with everything I wanted many were standard | CR-V would need to add so many options which should be standard | I'm happy I held off | I rode in a 2007 Escape as a loaner and there is a huge difference in ride noise comfort steering display and many other features | I just hit 1300 miles and and up to 19 | 2 mpg | 
 "words":  To date I have 1200 miles on the Escape and have not had as excepted a single problem | I use the car primarily as a means to get to work and for the usual weekend project stuff | Overall I am very impressed with the car and am averaging 23 | 0 mpg big Texas city driving 40 highway 60 city | I also really like the Sirius radio but was disappointed to learn that there are still the occasional commercials | Also when you go under an over-pass or in a tunnel you loose the satellite signal due to a line-of slight limitation | One thing I will pass on is that you need to be careful when folding down the rear sets if you have the leather interiors as the seat belt receptacle tends to 
 "words": After owning an Explorer I decided to move down to the Escape | Over all I was unimpressed | I expected more from a Ford SUV and loved my Explorer | I wanted something a bit smaller and was hoping it would handle slightly better | What I ended up with was a lot less room and an SUV built for someone who could not afford a real one | I would not reccomend this to my friends | 
 "words": I love my new '08 Escape | It looks great it | s fast and spacious | Gas mileage in the city has been about 19 | 8-21mpg | Excellent smooth ride on long trips | We have done 3500 miles in it | One problem the rear makes a rocking noise when the vehicle is just about to stop | The dealer has it for a 2nd time and cant work out what it is | The rear brakes grind when you press the pedal when in P or N | Has anyone else had this problem | Very annoying | I may have a lemon | They should have put 4 disc brakes instead | Overall I love the SUV but this problem is driving me crazy | To date they have replaced the mirror motor on the drivers side replaced a broken seal on the rear brakes and the left axle | 
 "words": I've never driven an older Escape but I have heard wonderful things about them | I loved this the moment I sat in the driver's seat | I was concerned about the gas mileage on the V6 AWD but it's not too horrible | I wonder why they still have this old 4 speed transmission | That is one of the few downfalls | I have all the goodies including XM and sunroof but the standard stereo is absolutely awful | I knew Ford's stereos were always poor but they should realize that many people make a huge buying decision in the stereo | I went from a newer VDub so maybe I am just being a snob on the stereo aspect | 
 "words": The new style 2008 Ford Escape is much more masculine than the past designs | It looks rugged and feels solid however it clearly is much quieter than the ones in the past | There's plenty of room all around but entry seems about an inch or two too high for my bad knees | I can deal with that because overall for the most part this is a winner | Don't give up on Ford yet | 
 "words": I was looking for a smaller vehicle to replace my '96 Ford Windstar without giving up too much storage | The new Escape XLT fit the bill perfect | The new Escape looks tough and does a great job for what I need | I am getting about 25mpg and very pleased with the looks and performance so far | My wife who drives an Accord V6 coupe would not come near the minivan now I can't keep her out of the Escape which is OK since her Honda is a sweet ride | The Escape 4cyl does just fine in this little truck it won't set any land speed records but it has no problem merging with traffic and cruising with the pack while delivering over 24mpg | Overall we are very pleased with our Escape | 
 "words": My old car was a Toyota 4Runner but hated the gas mileage and pain at the gas stations | So I switched to an Escape | At first I was worried I might lose lots of the space I had in the 4Runner but a surprise | My Escape has as big an inside space as my old one | I might be wrong because my old one was a mid- sized SUV but at least I feel that way and I'm sure about that | My big dog can fit in easily behind the 2nd row seat along with some groceries without a problem | The engine is very smooth and peppy | The acceleration is a little slow I think but heck I'm not a race car driver nor do I want to waste gas for quick acceleration | 
 "words": I didn't like the old Escape so as soon as I saw the new Escape I went to a dealer and test-drove one | It was much much quieter than the old one my brother is driving | Also I like the front new grille | The price is also very reasonable compared to ridiculously asking price of a RAV4 | I cross-shopped with a RAV4 and CRV and found the starting prices are similar but once I add the same options a Escape has the Japanese models cost 3K more | The feul economy is what I expected | It just gives me an everyday enjoyment on the road to work and home | I like the curtain bag too | 
 "words": '08 Escape XLS AWD is part of company car plan best option of the 3 choices offered | Have had vehicle for 6 weeks and just hit 5000 miles | Overall rate vehicle as fair | Unimpressed with engine power cabin noise and vibration | Driver's seat is horrible will fatigue you on short trips | Mileage is good 24 mpg on average mainly hwy | Little features missing like auto headlight shutoff daylight running lights and seatback pockets | Had issue with vehicle starting after sitting for 2 days during first 1500 miles imagine what might be in store after it gets 50k or more on it | I keep hoping for the best | but this isn't even close | 
 "words": I just picked up the 2008 Ford Escape 4WD with the V6 | I love this SUV | The handling and comfort is great with the leather interior | I wish it had more HP but with all the interior cargo space and room in that little truck I can't complain | Great value for the money | Fun to drive and I can really zip around turns on a dime | Can't wait until winter | 
 "words": I owned a Honda CRV but didn't like the driving | So I checked out Ford Escape and loved it during the test drive | The driving was completely different from my old CRV | I felt I was so miserable driving the CRV | Now I'm more than happy with my Escape | The fuel economy is as good as CRV | I don't know why people say Japanese cars have better fuel economy than domestics | The fit and finish is awesome too | I'm 6'2 but still snug enough in my Escape | Oh by the way it's much much quieter than the old CRV and even my friend's new CRV or RAV4 I've driven | My friends envy me and tells me as soon as their CRV RAV4 lease expires they buy Escape
 "words": I've been driving my Escape for about 3 months and I can tell you this | This is the best buy with your money | This is the true money saver | Very quiet interior and the fit and finish is second to none | My kids like the cool exterior design although I don't like the grille much but overall it's a strong SUV with a very good feul economy and cargo space | The new instrument panel over the old model is greatly improved and the price is virtually unchanged | The driving is so much fun between my work and home | I should have bought this earlier | Ford seems to find out what customers really want except 5 speed auto | 
 "words": Opted for the Escape over the RAV4 based on exterior design looks more SUV like and handsome | Although the RAV4 has a stronger engine and better gas mileage | Always been a fan of Ford | First domestic I have bought in some years let's see if the brand has improved | 
 "words": I looked at several other Ford options including the Edge and opted for the 2008 Escape because of the overall lighter vehicle weight and somewhat smaller duratec 4 valve engine | This CUV is really excellent | Great new IP and we have the Sun and Sound package with satellite radio and a plug-in for my iPod | It is awesome | There is loads of places to put things with the Rear Cargo Convenience package | The center console has a drop-in insert that holds audio cell phone stuff | When you remove this insert you can put lesser used items in the space just below the insert | Maps fit very well in map pockets | It handles very well and has RSC roll stability standard | 
 "words": I have owned this Escape for almost a month | It is very stylish and fun to drive | We live in a rural area and we average 23 mpg | I think it is also quieter than the 2005 Escape that we owned before | Overall I am very satisified with this vehicle | 
 "words": We have a XLT 4WD and what a dramatic difference from the older versions | especially the interior | thank goodness | This new version is so much better in my opinion | Dramatically quieter and more comfortable and the prices are actually lower than last year's model | We have some very steep hills in our area with gravel roads and the all wheel drive handles them with ease without any loss of traction and the transmission does all the braking on the way downhill with little effort saving my brakes the wear and tear | Love this CUV | 
 "words": I purchased my 08 Escape new | I loved my escape from the time I test drove it | With 7500 miles on my car it broke down on a 4 lane hwy in Taos NM | the transmission was shot | We had trouble recovering any compensation for our vacation or the cost incurrred for hauling the lemon back to AR | We continue to have problems with the transmission and are in the process of purchasing a new vehicle and selling my once loved Escape | 
 "words": I have owned my Escape for just over 2 years now | I purchased it new | I have had to have it towed 3 times in two years | Bad sensors bad transmission cooler and possibly the transmission now | I have loved the look and comfort of this vehicle but absolutely cannot depend on it | I don't have any issues with my dealership they have always worked with me | But I am truly dissatisfied with the vehicle as I put many miles on it and need to have reliability that it will get me from point A to point B | Will not buy a Ford again | 
 "words": I just bought my escape and i totally love it from the inside out i like thats its a suv so i can sit up higer and see traffic better as apposed to being in a car being short and all its kinda nice i can also get in and out easily with out having to do the ole heave ho action getting into my suv it rides smooth over speed bumps and on the road | i love that it gets good gas mialage for a suv | plus its easy to drive i dont feel like im driving a boat it feels like im driving a car but im up a lil higher i highly recomend this suv to anyone | 
 "words": I researched this vehicle thoroughly and was so happy when I finally purchased it | About a week after purchase a white residue began showing up on the cloth seats when exposed to moisture I made my purchase in December in the mountains where snow is abundant | The transmission cooler went out about a mother after purchase | About a month after that the exterior paint began chipping on the window moldings | All of the exterior moldings needed to be replaced | 
 "words": Ford knows that the transmission coolers on this particular SUV are failing prematurely | If you are lucky it fails before 36k miles | If not you are stuck with the bill | They will not recall | They will not stand behind the product | No more Fords for me |
