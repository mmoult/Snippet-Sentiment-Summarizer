REVIEWS
 "words": This car cannot make up its mind what gear it should go into | It drives like I'm not kidding here my old 3-speed K-car from the seventies | It can't seem to change gears without first dropping into passing gear even at 70 mph in cruise control thus the Lurchmobile | But at least I have the comfort of knowing that it looks beautiful and handles like I'm towing a trailer | I guess my overall rating is a 5 | 
 "words": First 2001 Highlander was superior to my 2008 | Poor visibility | Seat is so uncomfortable hate to drive for any length of time | 2008 does not handle as well as prior model | No traction in the snow | Mine is an AWD 6 cyl | Interior parts fall off | Very disappointed with 2008 Highlander | 
 "words": After owning Jeeps for the last 15 years I was reluctant to go Toyota but with a new baby we needed more room | I was skeptical of the Highlander's 5000lbs tow rating | Now after 11000 miles and several months of towing our 4000lbs 21 ft ski boat I am the Highlander's biggest fan | It pulls and stops our boat better than my Grand Cherokee ever did | Plus this is the most comfortable and solidly built car I have ever owned | Gas mileage is good at a city hwy avg of 21mpg towing drops it to 13 in our very hilly drive to the lake | 
 "words": I love everything about it | Went from a 2006 Honda Pilot EXL and have to say this car is a much better design completely | I have a loaded sport model minus the nav | The captain's car make 3rd row usable | Couldn't live w out power tailgate and back up camera now | I love love love how the extra seats folds away | On average I get 23 | 8 mpg better than my pilot | Accessories are cheaper than Hondas surprisingly | More bang for the buck than pilot all the way around | Sticker was 37k more than comp | Pilot but after rebate and wheelin' and deal'n got for 28K | The deals are out there just got to find them | Fun to drive mom car w out looking like the soccer mom van but still very functional | 
 "words": I owned a Jeep grand Cherokee limited and now this SUV | Love the extra room and the 3rd row | Miss the leather seats | guess once you own a limited it's hard to give up all those extra options | So easy to get the kids in and out and it's not a mini van | Wish that you could down load a picture on the screen for the clock back up camera | 
 "words": When I round a corner at normal speed the acceleration hesitates and can't make up its mind if it wants to stay high or go down lower | It's very irritating | My Toyota dealership said it is a gas saving computer thing and the only way to correct it is to drive more aggressively around corners | I tried doing that and my wife put a stop to my NASCAR aspirations | Also constant issues with the tires | I have owned Toyota's in the past and never had to add air every time I filled up | 
 "words": After careful research on midsize 7 passenger SUVs I selected the Highlander | The captains chair option with stowaway middle seat is truly novel and well executed | I have two toddlers so the other vehicles in the category that would force you to take out one of the car seats from the second row to get access to the 3rd row just didn't work for me | It has all the bells and whistles I wanted like the rear camera nav system and heated seats and is super well though out inside | It looks good outside too | I had a Lexus RX 300 before this that I loved and this is comparable with the bonus of seating the parents and in-laws when they are in town | 
 "words": Why buy an awd | The tires that come for it are junk | Only two mfg make them | The tires are very poor in the snow | See tire rack survey | Toyota told me to install chains | Why did I pay for the awd | Toyota blew it when it specked these tires | They should have gone to a size where there are more tires avail | 
 "words": Have about 1200 miles on my HI sport | Have noticed in rear seats section of leather is looking stretched out | These two seats sat in app 2 hours a week if that | Not noticed in drivers seat that I am in day in and day out | Dealer saying it's not an issue | I would understand the 'worn' look after a year or two but after 8 weeks c'mon | Am guessing the pieces of leather may be thinner than other pieced on the seat I'm not giving in til I get some resolution this is a 30K vehicle | 
 "words": This car has been great so far | The gas mileage is exactly what the sticker says | 16 city and 24 highway | I have averaged 20mpg since I purchased the car | Remember you are driving a car suv that seats 6 7 people | This not a small vehicle do not expect 30 mpg | The Highlander is very roomy and the second row is great | The captains chairs are awesome | XM have the dealer do it or if you want to save 100 bucks buy the parts from the dealer then take the parts to a stereo shop for installation | Just came out of a Sierra snow storm and the highlander performed well | AWD works well and the snow button softens your throttle inputs | Toyo A20s are wearing quickly | Had dealer make a note of this | 
 "words": The limited is a good quiet ride | It's really a van disguised as an SUV | Goes in a straight line very well | The interior is roomy and near luxury with leather | Drove and looked at many SUV's and waited for this model to come out | So far we are glad we did | Averaged 27mpg on last highway trip at 70mph | Runs on regular engine likes methanol | Beautiful exterior build quality excellent | Automatic rear door might be a real plus on this SUV | Engine somewhat loud at cold start up you can hear those 24 valves | Goes away quickly | Bluetooth phone dial by number is not very easy to use but speed dial works very well | This car was more expensive than others we tested but worth it | 
 "words": I have had a Saturn Vue for several years and I hated it | The MPG on the Saturn was 19 | When the new style Highlander came out I dragged my husband to the dealer to test drive it | I fell in love with it | I has everything I could want in a SUV | Its the best investment I could ever ask for | And the gas mileage is great | I am getting between 24 to 26 MPG | 
 "words": This is my first toyota SUV traded in my older Camry | A smooth and powerful V6 engine quiet and comfortable ride nice interior layout and romminess | excellent build quality | But strong engine vibration when cold start eventually will gone after engine warm up | need to bring back to dealer to check up | Steering and handling are secure but not sound | Fuel economy only so so I'm conservative drive and try to lite on gas | I only get around 15 mpg mix driving | Rear door hatch is heavy to open and close | Overall is a very nice SUV with some negative | 
 "words": I was anticipating to write a rave review on my 3 month old car | Unfortunately it did not live up to the high expectations | My gas mileage has been well below the posted 17 22 | It has been 11 18 18 after the car was repaired | Last month the car would not start | It took five tries and pushing the gas to finally get it started | There was smoke and a burnt smell coming out my engine area | It took the dealership almost three day to figure out the problem that being a faulty injector | Very frustrating process poor service from both the selling dealership and Toyota's 800 customer satisfaction line | I find it ironic that our Chevy Silverado now 6 years old has never needed a repair | 
 "words": Have driven my 08 Limited AWD for only about a month majority of mileage is highway driving | Very satisfied with performance | MPG has averaged 25-27 on highway | Had two avalons' prior to this SUV | Never a mechanical problem | 
 "words": Last vehicle I had was a 1991 Mazda Navajo | What a difference 16 years makes | Did 4 months of research Edmunds Cars | com Vehix CR all rated the car well despite new design | Choice between Pilot Highlander | Pilot was a little too utilitarian and mpg ratings fr blogs dissuaded me | I made the right choice | Have only had it a month and filled it twice but highway got 25 mpg mixed got 20 | 5 mpg despite 6 cylinder limited AWD tow package backup navi bluetooth | All user friendly | Highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": I have had my Highlander for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say that I would never have leased this car if I had driven it for more than a few minutes | The steering wheel makes a clicking noise and I feel a click when I turn it | The third row has giant headrests that block your view out the back window | This is really not a 7 passenger vehicle unless the person sitting in the middle seat is tiny and then they should probably be in a carseat | I dislike driving the Highlander soooo much and don't know how I will keep it for the next 38 1 2 months | Was trying to save some and didn't save very much and got a car that I hate | I keep hoping it will grow on me but then I drive it | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota and we really do love it | I wish it got a little better gas milage but we needed the extra room | We really enjoy all the bells and whistles | We travel alot and it just makes it that much more enjoyable | We did get 24 mpg on a trip to Fla | but we usually get around 20 mpg | 
 "words": Have enjoyed driving from the time we drove off the lot | Highway performance is especially good having driven it in clean clear conditions and during snow whiteout situation | 
 "words": I LOVE this car | We researched new cars for about 5 months before deciding on this one | The interior has more room than the 4runner and yet still has bigger tires and gets better gas mileage | Plus the third row is standard and folds flat the 4runner isn't a standard 7-passenger and the seats don't fold flat | The layout of the interior is superior to the pilot and every other car we had test riden | It just by far is the best reliable car that can be sporty but yet still fit the whole family in | We are a family of 5 and fit very comfortably | I just love driving it | 
 "words": Main alternatives considered Jeep Cherokee Mazda CX-9 and 4-Runner | Love the grey Highlander faceplate on back | Interior is very comfortable I have cloth b c all the dealers informed me b c of a leather embargo they were now holding leather for Limited only | But Sport has higher grade cloth | 
 "words": We traded a 2005 Pathfinder with a 4 | 0L engine | This has more power drives and handles better and is more comfortable | Even the third row is bigger than the Pathfinder | Overall fit and finish is excellent | We were concerned about going from a full frame truck to the uni-body but after driving it for a month we made the right choice | 
 "words": Just got the new highlander wonderful car | Works well and has enough room for 7 | Contrary to beliefs and reading many reviews the highlander does have PLENTY of room for a full size adult in the 3rd row | In addition the highlander can move the seats and contains much more room inside | 
 "words": Due to an upcoming move to upstate NY I needed to trade in my 2006 VWPassat for a 4-wheel drive vehicle | We were looking at 4-runners Honda Pilots and Suburu Outbacks | I originally felt that the Highlander looked too much like a van from the inside and did not even want to test drive it but after a week of looking around I agreed to try it | Needless to say it was a fabulous test drive and I could not be happy with the ride of the 4-runner or the Honda Pilot | The Outback is a great drive as well but for the money you get a lot more vehicle with the Highlander | I have had it for a week now and my husband and I both love it | 
 "words": The 2008 Highlander drives like a car but has a good high seating position | I was surprised by the amount of power I get from the V6 engine | Loaded with 5 adults and 2 children it didn't hesitate on hills at all | Very comfortable inside | Love the automatic rear door | Mileage has been about 21-22 MPG in mixed 70 freeway and 30 city driving | Interior cargo room is adequate with the third row folded though I have a Yakima roof box for long trips or when using all three rows | That was my trade off for not getting a Suburban for the few times I really needed the extra space inside | Ride is a little soft but that may be because I was used to a truck and 15 MPG | 
 "words": We converted from loyal Subaru fans to Toyota because we needed a bigger car and were not impressed with the Tribeca | So far the HL has been great | Good power in the mountains and no problem climbing I-70 in the winter | interior is quiet and dua climate is great for kids in back | Good storage for road trips and fun to drive | Don't feel like you're driving an SUV which we love | 
 "words":  Purchased the '08 Highlander FWD on Thursday | Very solid and well built vehicle with a powerful V-6 engine and well matched 5 speed automatic | The interior is upscale and flawless | I also have a leased '05 Sienna van and the ride is very similar | I noticed the power steering is slightly overboosted and could give a little more effort and road feel but that is the nature of the electrically assisted steering as opposed to the older hydraulic power steering | As noted by others the liftgate is on the heavy side and requires some effort to close | My Sienna has never been back to the dealer I do my own oil changes and brake pads very easy and I expect this Toyota to be as reliable | 
 "words": We were wanting to buy a Chevy Tahoe since it was more plush and quieter | I could not justify the gas mileage on the larger Chevy | The Chevy lacked many refined details available in the toyota | Rear back up camera well designed interior and overall attention to detail compelled us to buy Toyota | I am not complaining about the gas mileage overall it's right at 21 MPG | The automatic rear hatch door is just fantastic | Althought the factory JBL speaker are ample sound for most people I upgraded aftermarket by adding a more powerfull amp | I have also been critical of road noise | Not that it's loud on the highway but it certainly could use some improvement in insulation | 
 "words": Hey Highlander lovers after trading an Avalon 05 for a Rav4 08 in October I realized that after 3 months I wasn't as happy as I missed the features I had on the Avalon and traded for the Highlander | The Highlander Limited AWD 08 is a perfect SUV for me and I love it | The interior space is large enough for me as I am 6'2 | The leather seats are very comfortable and I love the instrumentation on the dash | I enjoy the lighted cup holder feature for night driving | It has a very smooth quiet ride and the Blizzard Pearl color looks fantastic on the SUV | The navigation is much easier than the Avalon as it has a touch pad | Before you buy your next SUV drive a Highlander | You will love it | 
 "words": I have had this FWD Highlander for less than a month | I have about 2300 miles | Traveled a lot over Christmas and several trips from Fairfax Virginia to Duck NC and Virginia Beach | Surprised that the in town gas mileage is better than the EPA rating | Even on the first tank in town when the HL had less than 50 miles on it the mileage under bad circumstances was over 19 | Commuting to metro and in heavy traffic I've done about 22 average on a tank of gas in town On the highway I have been for times as high as 27 | 6 MPG but my best tank average was about 26 with 25 being more common so far | Still that is better than the EPA rating and I'm traveling with I-95 and I-64 traffic at 75
 "words": Just bought the 2WD Limited edition | Took it for a test drive before buying but I didn't notice the poorly designed inside door handles | It seems when you try and use the electric window switches the handle gets in the way | Try it you'll see what I mean | I have a 2003 Highlander and it rides better then this 2008 | This 2008 rides more like a truck with the 19 wheels | All in all I think it's one of the best out there | They just have to twik it a bit | Also it's bigger than my 2003 which I think I like I'll have to get use to it | 
 "words": I have had my Toyota for under 30 days I had been looking for a smaller SUV for over a year and had test drove everything from the Cadillac SRX to the Acura MDX and at the end I finally narrowed down my options to the Toyota Highlander | The Highlander without a doubt has proven to not only be a more spacious vehicle the new body style is awesome looks almost like the 08 Lexus LX570 | It has a sound ride not to mention how many mpg I get in the city 15-17 and 18-19 on the freeway | My kids absolutely love it and I love the fact that the 1st oil change isn't until 5000 miles | 
 "words": Having owned the 2005 Highlander I find the redesigned model to be better handling more powerful smoother transmission and vastly larger feeling inside | Being our family vehicle I found the 2005 model to be basic transportation but nothing special to drive | The 2008 model I actually enjoy driving and find it has some level of excitement as well as far more practical access to the third row seat | Mileage has been slightly better than advertised 24 vs 23 on a recent highway trip | Found very comfortable on a long distance trip | 
 "words": Took advantage of the low lease rates offered by Toyota in December leasing a Base AWD with just a few options including rear air | Did not need anything fancy but wanted something for my wife that would seat seven without the size of a minivan | The ride is smooth quiet and comfortable | The engine transmission is powerful and well matched | Initial quality appears high though I have owned the vehicle for only two weeks time will tell | Although amenities on the base model are fairly minimal it has the basics including cruise tilt decent radio and some great features | The layout of the dashboard and instrumentation is very attractive | 
 "words": I bought a new Highlander after previously owning 3 other Toyota full-size SUV's | a 1983 Landcruiser 1993 Landcruiser 2002 Sequoia | I wanted a smaller more manueverable more fuel efficient but still comfortable car | I also needed the ability to carry seven passengers for short periods once in a while | I am delighted with the car so far | I have had it about a month and have put about 1500 miles on it | I bought a fully equiped Limited model including nav system blue tooth phone both front and rear auto A C | It has been a little bit of a challenge to get used to the nav system and also the bluetooth phone | Sometimes it works very well other times it is frustrating | 
 "words": The 2008 highlander has been a huge upgrade over our 2003 | Thank you Toyota | More room less noise better braking more safety features and lots of bells and whistles | I know I won't have to worry about workmanship | For as fuel economy it all depends on the driver and the elements | 
 "words": Traded in a 2003 Highlander for the 2008 Sport | We have only been driving it for two weeks and we love it | It is a great car for the price practical quiet looks great in and out | Nice upgrades compared to the 2003 for few dollars more | Accessibilty is great w large doors rear window can be lifed | The ergonomic is great buttons and controls are w n easy reach where they should be | I highly recommend it for young families in need of a practical yet comfortable SUV | The rear is spacious for cargos w 2nd and 3rd row folded | 
 "words": We purchased the vehicle a week ago | The engineering is very good amazing to think they could pack in as much in such a small vehicle | I was concerned about the gas mileage but now after about 600 miles seem to be averaging 21 to 22 mpg | It is fast and if you drive it like a race car it will only get 16 to 17 I am sure | I still have not had a chance to read all of the instructional info but believe once I figure it out it will be a blessing | The hands free blue tooth is great | The leather and interior is as nice as Mercedes and more higher end cars | My wife had some problems with the smart key etc | in her first foray driving about 400 miles | She got pulled over going over 80 mph | 
 "words": Excellent choice | I compared to Acura MDX Lexus RX 350 BMW X5 6 cyl | Hyundai VeraCruz Subaru Tribeca with test drives | Sport model has firmer suspension than all other Highlander models which is why I picked it | Have pushed this car hard in turns and while it leans it won't give up grip | Quiet and smooth on the highway | After 3300 miles I average 21 mpg overall | Seats are comfortable with plenty of room 3rd row only for small kids | V6 has great pickup and smooth shifts | Stereo is fine | Navigation system is a flop not intuitive buy a Garmin instead | Have owned Toyota Lexus for 20 yrs | Great overall reliability | 
 "words": I've had Toyotas before and been very pleased | I've had this Highlander for about five months and have serious misgivings about having purchased it | I'm reminded of this everytime I have to use two hands to push down the back door | it's very hard to close | It's been many years since I've driven a car with a noteciably poor transmission but when starting off going down hill which is how our drive is situated this transmission is rough | You can see the RPMs reving then hear and feel the transmission catch up | I took it into the dealership but they claim that is the way it is supposed to be | I've never had a problem with a car until I bought this Highlander and really wouldn't recommend it
 "words": I just got my 2008 Highlander today and I'm very excited | I traded an Audi A4 and have never had an SUV | I drove a lot of the smaller SUVs CR-V Santa Fe Rogue and Rav4 | None of those got me excited | Then I discovered the base model Highlander is in the same price range as the higher end models of these smaller SUVs and ROCKS compared to the others | It's like night day | I did have to sacrifice some of the fancy gadgets that I may have been able to afford on the others but I felt it was well worth it to have a car that I really loved inside and out | The base model Highlander is very well equipped for those on a budget and the gas mileage is about the same as the smaller SUVs | 
 "words": I test drove an HL in 06 and liked it but decided to wait | When I saw the pics for the 08 I knew it was time | What an improvement | I have had my HL for 3mo now | I wanted luxury with utility and the Limited fits the bill perfectly | The EPA ratings seem to be accurate | I'm getting 22 mixed and 27 hwy 70mph | The seats are very comfortable at first but start to feel hard after a couple of hours on long trips | People have complained about the head rest I find their position to be perfect and comfortable | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota and I wanted an SUV with more reliabilty and better gas mileage than my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee | This vehicle is perfect in size and the 3rd row seat is great for short trips with more than 5 adults | I like the styling and features of the LTD | However the front seats are not padded enough to be comfortable on long trips and the gas mileage is disappointing | I have driven 3300 miles and have average 15 mph in city driving and 19 mph on the freeway | 
 "words": This is my third Toyota | I started with the ever reliable Corolla that I had for 12 years and 120000 miles until I passed it on to my niece | Then in 2001 I was one of the first to buy the newly introduced Highlander | It was an instant love affair | I've had it for 6 | 5 years and it just hit 96000 miles | It has had very minor problems or issues | I decided to upgrade to the 2008 even though the new design hasn't grown on me as quickly | I am also finding the electronic steering is taking some getting used to and I can really feel the changing of gears in this vehicle much more than my old highlander | I am not totally in love with my new highlander but I am hoping it's just the transition | 
 "words": A month and 1800 miles and we love our new Highlander | The wide luxury ride took a little getting used to after a 95 GMC Jimmy and an 89 Pathfinder but it is a pleasure to drive especially on longer trips | I do not find any discomfort in the seats | Controls are well placed interior design is good | Features seem to be well thought out and well placed | This is the first luxury vehicle I have ever owned and I think I have spoiled myself | Not an off road vehicle but I expect it to be good in bad weather | Love the nav rear dvd for the kids and aux input on the stereo for the ipod | The visibility seems excellent and I am expecting same Toyota quality I had in my Fav 84 Celica | Very happy | 
 "words": The 2008 model is largely improved in size horse power and gas mileage | 4x4 runs very smooth | Three-zone AC is better than Lexus I have | To really enjoy the car you | d better have new technologies such as voice controlled GPS blue tooth and MP3 build-in | That means you must have navigation option | I think it cannot be called GPS option | It is a command center | With the screen you will edit your phone book select music from MP3 list or check who is calling when your cell phone is ring | The new device let me thinking to sell my wife's 2004 Lexus and get a new car with similar device | 
 "words": We wanted to graduate out of our wagon | Our decision came down to Mazda CX-9 Hyunda Veracruz and the Highlander | The Veracruz seemed a little more luxurious but we were hesitant about reliability resale | The best part about the Highlander is that there was nothing in the con list except maybe initial price | But take into account resale and that goes away | 
 "words": We have had our new Highlander for 1 week now and we LOVE it | It is a blast to drive and I feel safe inside it | If you are thinking about buying one don't hesitate just DO IT | You won't regret it | 
 "words": Bought this as the wife's new vehicle | It replaced her '00 Impala | What an upgrade | It is comfortable quiet and for a vehicle of it's considerable size and power gets really good fuel mileage | We got every option except for the nav and the rear seat DVD | We have portables of both and didn't see the need to spend an extra 4k on just those 2 options | Excellent up front storage capability with a glove box almost big enough to fit a desktop computer | Comfortable versatile and economical everything we wanted combined with Toyota's bulletproof reliability reputation | Our first Toyota and we're hooked | 
 "words": This is my first truck and it is solid | I don't need many techies but would like something that is reliable and safe for day to day driving | Highlander is a perfect choice |

 "words": I've been very happy with this vehicle | It has many nice options and is quite comfortable | The ride is very smooth and I like the overall design | I'm not quite as happy with the gas mileage as I had expected in my stop and go trip to work I'm lucky to get 17 or at best 18 mpg | I'm very pleased with the interior upgrades that come with the limited the materials are as nice as my Navigator and nicer than my former 4Runner | I'm not thrilled with the steering a bit soft | And heavy accelerations isn't well accepted by this transmission | over-revs and down shifts too hard | In regard to the steering and acceleration I'd take the 4Runner any day but overall other features make it even | 
 "words": I have always driven Toyotas and traded in my Avalon for this SUV | To think that I was considering another SUV really crazy | I'm a single lady and wasn't too crazy about the styling of the 2007 Highlander | looked like a family car | But once I saw the 2008 I was totally surprised | I have owned this car for 1 week and 1 day and anticipate keeping it for a long time | Great comfort great gas mileage and a fun car to drive | The 2008 is indeed larger and carries on the Toyota legacy of being a top quality vehicle | And once you drive it you won't need to test drive anything else | Worth every penny I spent | 
 "words": We love our new 2008 Highlander | We were looking at the Honda Pilot but are very glad we went with the Highlander | Gas mileage is what you would expect for an SUV of this size but better than stated by Toyota | Living in the mountains I have used the downhill assist and it worked great | We also like the ability to switch to manual shift | It will come in handy this winter | Haven't used the snow button yet but will probably use it quite frequently this winter | We went with the base because the price of the additional features wasn't worth the extra money for us | 
 "words": I gave up my sports car for this SUV and have few regrets | I sacrificed tight steering and handling and quick start off the light for a quieter smoother roomier car for me and my family | In retrospect I should have done this a long time ago | The cargo space with easy fold seating is great for hauling away moderate cargo | Even though it is higher off the ground it's so much easier to put the baby seat in the second row | The leather bucket seats in my old car were difficult to get in and out of | The AWD is great | My RWD car was slipping all over the place | Looked at Tribeca Pathfinder Enclave and Tahoe but this one felt right for me | Good price and good size | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota and what a wonderful experience | I am a 48 year old grandmother who still needs a little fun in her life | This vehicle fits the bill of not too large and not too small | Perfect for taking my children to college loading groceries and simply a blast to drive | Would highly recommend this car-based vehicle to everyone | Past loves have been Expeditions minivans and a sport car | Best value and so much more | I appreciate the car more each day | Even my honda loving husband of 24 years enjoys driving it | I love the stares when I drive it |

 "words": Great car | Fuel economy is above average I was hoping for terrific fuel economy | Fun to drive power when needed comfortable for longer trips | Many standard features are optional on other comparable SUVs | I am looking forward to winter driving to test the performance in snow | Highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": As a man who has had 5 hip replacements and two knees and was very happy with his two Odysseys I was interested to look at the '08 Highlander | What scared me off the CX-9 was no Mazda store in town and questionable reliability | I cannot be happier with the Toyota nor with the way I was treated at the store which I had never previously been in | The styling is outstanding everyone knows Toyota's quality and the mileage has been good | 
 "words": I have been looking for cars and reading their specs for 8 months | I decided to wait for the 2008 Highlander and the Nissan Rogue | Although I loved the Rogue my husband complained that his knees legs hit the center console | I needed these things in a car comfort good economy for the vehicle size takes regular unleaded gas enough instant pickup to get on the freeway decent warranty | The V-6 offers as much power as did my V-8 Mountaineer | I am averaging 21 mpg so far | The comfort is not the best but better than most short seated cars in this price range | 
 "words": I had an 05 Rav 4 which was a great little SUV but the 08 Highlander that I've had for 3 weeks now is a lot more fun and a lot less cramped | Very quiet on the highway quick to accelerate and a very comfortable interior | Took some getting used to with the bigger front | Love the radio with the 'sound adjustment' feature | When the road gets loud the radio goes up | 
 "words": My wife and I were looking for a new crossover SUV and it came down to the Ford Explorer and the Toyota Highlander | We just bought it last weekend | I chose the Toyota because my previous experiences with their vehicles have been very positive and I perceived the Toyota to be a better value | The looks are stunning it rides like a Lexus and the build quality is superior to the Ford's | If you drive her easy you can easily get 25 mpg city highway not bad for a 270 hp 5000 lb vehicle | We also needed something that would last us 10 years or more so I gravitated towards the Toyota | 
 "words": I only have owned for 2 weeks but this vehicle has surpassed my expectations | I researched and tested Acadia and Mazda CX9 however based on the features and looks of the Highlander this was my choice | I am hoping the maintenance and cost of ownership of the Toyota reputation is valid with this vehicle | I have received many thumbs-up gestures from older Highlander drivers | I chose the Sport with a lot of extras | Would have been easier to deside if a greater selection of Highlanders were on the lot but I am thrilled with the color and vehicle I ordered | 
 "words": I traded my 2004 Sequoia since I have decided to go a litle more green in my life | I still need the ability to drive around 2 small children and was not going to get a minivan | The new Highlander fits the bill perfectly | Drives like a Camry not a truck and is so quiet and comfortable | I got the factory tow hitch and running boards Option A package | I will be adding the body side moldings when they get reintroduced with the proper adhesive | I have all weather floor and cargo mats door edge guards and a few oil filters being shipped to me | Also waiting for the hood deflector to be released |

 "words": So far this is a great vehicle | Great power and gets 24 | 4 on the highway | The base has the standard features but when you are used to a loaded Toyota you do not realize how many options you are missing until you leave the dealership | No power lift gate | Takes two men and a small boy to pull it down | No outside temp gauge | Manual cloth base seats are not all that comfortable on trips | No blue tooth no hitch though you pay standard for the prep | I guess they drilled some holes in the frame for you | You cannot buy a hitch yet | No body side molding | I see numerous door dings in the future | Multiple blind spots | Need to add the convex mirrors in the corners |

 "words": I am enjoying many wonderful features of my new Highlander | However I am learning that I was more spoiled than I realized with my Tahoe | Seat comfort on long trips is an issue | There is much more road noise than I have been used to | Would undercoating possibly diminish the noise factor | I attempted to get tires that might be quieter | Due to the size the tire store owner could not locate options for me with three of the main manufacturers and he did not pursue it any further | Other than that I love not needing to fumble in my purse for the keys all the time | That's great when your hands are full | 
 "words": Recently purchased the Highlander | It is a great SUV | Very roomy high quality interior | I'm over 6 foot and have plenty of room in 1st and 2nd rows | Suspension and steering could be slightly more firm however neither is anywhere near as bad as some say | Doesn't handle compared to CX-9 but if you want a great overall package make sure you test drive the Highlander |

 "words": I took delivery of my silver '08 Highlander Sport with 4wd in August | After three weeks and 300 miles I have the following admittedly small reservations | 1 The steering is too light and doesn't offer enough feel of the road | 2 The interior uses some cheap-looking and cheap-feeling plastic probably to keep the Highlander from usurping Lexus buyers | 3 Handling is surprisingly squirrely on the highway a lot of little course corrections needed despite the 4wd | This could be a problem inherent with the 19 inch wheels and tires | 4 Driver's side power window switches are blocked slightly by inside door pull handle | Not bad but enough to be annoying | 
 "words": This basic AWD model is almost identical in size to our 2000 Merc Mountaineer but a little wider and way better ride | Interior fan so much quieter | Headlights much better illumination | Not as good looking or as much fun to drive as the Rav4 in my opinion but we want to tow a 4000 lb travel trailer and the Rav won't quite do it | This Highlander has plenty of goodies as standard equipment | And 8 ground clearance yet it's easier to get in and out of than the old Mountaineer | My 5'2 wife is happy about that |
