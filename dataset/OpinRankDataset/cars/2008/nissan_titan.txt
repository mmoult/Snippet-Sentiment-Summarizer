 "words": Truck is a 2008 | 5 that I use for daily driving and towing a 4000 LB boat around | I was comparing this truck to the 1 2 ton GMC and Tundra but I picked the Nissan after test driving all 3 because of the Titan's interior and exterior looks and feel | The leather seats look to be very high quality plus the dash controls and gauges are more modern looking well placed and practical | The performance of this truck will put a smile on your face anytime you feel the need | Gas mileage is not great but I knew that when I bought this truck | The only problems I had or have is that the rear underseat storage container squeaks and the tire pressure alarm lit up and would not reset until 40psi was used | 
 "words": We bought a 2008 Nissan Titan fully loaded except the nav entertainment system | We got the nice Pebble Beach colour | Over-all we are happy with the truck plenty of power handles nicely luxury interior awesome sound system Rockford Fosgate rides better than a Chev although it mainly has to do with the great seats the truck has a much more heavy duty suspension and chassis set-up and has very unique and handy features | We although had two VERY minor issues with the truck at 20000km | The stereo twice now stopped producing sound but was on and was fixed by turning the truck off and restarting it | The second issue is the Tire Pressure Sensor Light is on although the tires are fine | 
 "words": It is a 08 | 5 just turned 12000 miles and not a problem | I looked at all the options out there Toyota Ford and Chevy | Toyota was my 1 choice but to get a crew cab you only got a 5 | 5 ft bed what would you do with that | I looked and compared trucks for six months | I never considered the Nissan until my wife took me over to the dealer and I have yet to look back | I Like It | It has all the options and some | I drive 60 Highway and 40 everything else | I am averaging 15 to 16 | 5 mpg | The 7 ft bed is great room for all the gear ATV and the deer | The only thing I did not like it is hard to find an off road friendly tire in the 20in rim with out putting on a lift | 
 "words": Traded a 2005 Silverado Crew Cab for the Nissan and have been very pleased so far | Excellent power and smooth shifts | Hauls wife kids like a full- size car but carries anything you can throw in the back or hook to the hitch | Very comfortable seats and roomy cab with great options | Would prefer an auto 4WD mode and a Neutral on the transfer case as well as mechanical anit-spin differentials instead of the brake system | Love the R-F sound system and the DVD entertainment | Could do without the 20 rims and low-profile tires as I prefer capability over bling | Have had a couple minor issues but I've had that with every truck I've ever owned | 
 "words": It is an 08 | 5 I looked at all the others and was set on the Toyota but the full crew cab had a poor 5 | 5 foot bed | What would you do with that | So my wife pointed me to look at the Nissan and I have yet to look back it has just turned 12000 miles and I Like It the fuel mileage is good between 15 and 17 60 highway | I lost 3 mpg from my old Toyota Tacoma but gained so much more load and towing ability | With the LB there is room for the ATV gear and the Deer | The LE is great too and all the comforts someone could ask for | Good job Nissan | 
 "words": We found a Titan with 3600 miles on it traded in a 2000 Chevy Tahoe | The Titan has been such a nice surprise for us | We tow a 6000lb RV and it blows our old Tahoe away with its towing capability | Smooth transmission and even better fuel mileage while towing vs | the Tahoe | As far as fuel economy goes that too has been a pleasant surprise | We're getting about 15 to 15 | 5mpg in town driving | You have to keep your foot out of it for sure | Its actually a little better on fuel mileage than the Tahoe | I love the interior design feel its definitely an improvement over the Tahoe workmanship | Smooth ride | Only downside is it is loud | I had the dealer switch out exhaust systems | All around we love this truck | 
 "words": I live in Anchorage Alaska so I wanted a nice 4wd vehicle that I could pull my toys with and take people along as well | The Titan has been everything I could have ever wanted it to but until recently I don't know if it's the harsh temperature or just a flaw from Nissan but I've taken it back to the dealership 2x and still the axle squeaks every time I brake or just drive under 10mph | Other than that it's awesome | 
 "words": Did my homework | I love my Titan with a couple of exceptions | Soon after purchase it felt like there was a role of quarters in the left side of my seat cushion | To their credit dealer replaced seat | However seat is still uncomfortable should have got the leather I suppose | Also the truck has no outside temp gauge I can't believe it | Dealer is no help and emails and calls to Nissan net no response at all | As a result I will never buy another Nissan product | Other than that I really do like everything else about this truck | But alas I hear Nissan is giving up after their first try | I wonder where the Tundra would be if Toyota gave up after just one shot at it | 
 "words": Love all the extra interior room | Traded in an extended cab Z71 for crew cab Titan | Mpg is what I expected for a full size truck | 
 "words": I was looking to buy another Sierra until I sat in a Titan at the Auto Show | This truck has the most comfortable seating of any vehicle I have ever sat in as well as a ton of leg room important for me as I have long legs | I tow an 18' fiberglass boat that is kind of heavy and this truck pulls it very well | The nav system is excellent and a nice option to have | It was hard to find one with side air bags as the package for air bags includes an electronic stability system both of which I feel should be standard on all vehicles | Gauges are well designed and easy to read | The transmission temp gauge is nice to have if you are towing anything | 
 "words": I just picked up my new 2008 | 5 Titan I really like the upgrades like the lighted steering wheel controls the bluetooth and the sat | radio | The seats sit better than 07s did | I also love the burly exhaust | It's surprised a couple of my buddy's who have the hemi dodges when it out ran them | 
 "words": This is my second Titan | Lease trucks through business | First Titan was awesome as not one bit of trouble trouble was couldn't keep out of it as I always loved driving it | Was never thinking of changing to another truck but after rethinking the lease options again and seeing I was over mileage I looked at others but kept coming back to Titan | Love the quality performance and overall satisfaction of my older 2005 titan | This new one is awesome | Great performance | Great sound system and just a good truck | Have only had it a week but can tell you the quality is there and the service from our local dealership is great | I'm sure I'll have more to write but so far this is another great truck
 "words": It has a shake wobble that is at times down right scary | It's always there but sometimes it's light and sometimes it will shake the steering wheel out of your hands | I will never own another | Also the front end shakes and shimmies when I hit a hole like it was worn out and I have 16000 miles on it | I'm scared to take it on a trip | I've owned Dodge Ford Chevy trucks and I would take any of them over this Titan | 
 "words": This is an amazing truck | It truly outperforms the competition in every aspect | except gas mileage | The wife wants me to sell it because of the 13city-17hwy MPG stats | Aftermarket bolt-ons only help a little | Maybe with a smaller V-8 engine package you could set up your application the way you need | I hear the bed squeak when I have the back window down | There have been absolutely no problems with my Titan I love it and it has the most get up and go out of all the trucks I have tested | Buy it if you can afford the gas |
