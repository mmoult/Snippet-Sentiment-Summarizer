REVIEWS
 "words": After 6000 miles I have had several problems mostly electrical | The air bags were broken 1 week after purchase and my driver seat moves backwards while driving | The finish of the dashboard is separating around the airbag housing | The car drives well but I fear that it will be falling apart in a few years | After this experience probably wont buy another Hyundai | 
 "words": This is my third Hyundai my two others were Sonata's | I loved both of those but after upgrading to the Azera this is by far more bang for the buck than BMWLexus or any other high end car this size | I'm getting 28-30 mpg on rural roads at 45-50 mph and 32-36 highway at 70mph | Powerful 3 | 8 ltr and great mileage to boot | Try and find one coming off lease and save big | 
 "words": Have had Taurus's since 1986 | Went to look at a new Sonata and saw this used 08 Azera | We fell in love and a short test drive was all we needed | I've driven BMW's a Lexus and this is right at the top with them only less expensive | We can't say enough about the car | Ride is smooth and quiet | XM Radio and stereo system is top notch | Power fold mirrors are the cats meow | Driver 1 and 2 position seting should be on all cars | So many features We are very impressed | If you are looking for a car and a value for your money you should drive one of these and purchase it | Oh by the way | The wife hardly lets husband drive it | it's hers | 
 "words": I loved this car for the first two months | Since then I have had nothing but problems | So many rattles and clicking noises | I hate this car now | I have had it in the shop so many times I have lost count | I am sick and tired of the dealership telling me the car is fixed and then driving it home the same noise occurs | I am ready to shoot it and put it and me out of misery | 
 "words": I never never ever thought that I would buy a Hyundai | But I did | And I am forever so glad | I have owned over 40 cars including Lincoln Lexus Buick Lancia Karmin Ghia Oldsmobile Ford Volvo etc | and by far this 08 Hyundai Azera drives circles around all of them | I traded an 07 Buick Lucerne CXS after only 9 months of shear frustration with all of the problems including a bad vibration whenever the engine was doing 1500 rpms regardless of the speed of the car | And the turning radius was horrendous | And you could not see the instrument in the daytime | And the front seat belts were nonfunctional would not lock up | And on and on and on | This Azera was an answer to my prayers
 "words": Purchased used from dealer executive car with only 22K miles It was extremely well taken care of and looks and drives brand new | still smells new | It now has almost 30K and I'm still pleased with it | plan to keep it a long time | I get lots of compliments and now that I have one I'm starting to notice them on the road more | You can't beat it for the price | however the Genesis is very tempting | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 azera on june 1st of 2009 | It was a program car and had 8400 miles on it | It cost a little less than a camry and had a better warranty but that's the only good part | It in no way matches the quality of a toyota camry | I've read these reviews and have decided that they must have been written by hundai dealers | My overall gas mileage is around 18 mpg | I guess that's good if you compare it with a hummer | I took the car on vacation and the throttle sensor went out 22 times before i could get it to a dealership to fix it | The mechanic who fixed it said that he had fixed several of them and he didn't know why they didn't have a recall on them | I'm very disappointed in the car | 
 "words": Traded an 07 Buick Lucerne CXS in on this Azera about a month ago | I had been researching and test driving earlier versions of it | Traded it in on an 08 Azera Limited with the Ultimate Package | The Azera is a driver's car | it performs and handles excellently | I have added mp3 wireless and a lip spoiler etc | Gangbusters | SemperFi
 "words": Purchased used rental with 13500 miles at more than 8000 less than a new '09 | I looked at all options in the mid-size full size new used and settled on the Azera when several became available from the rental fleets | Traded a 2005 Maxima | I use for business sales and needed something that was safe and comfortable | The Azera wins hands down | I have averaged around 25 mpg 75 highway 25 city and find the freeway drive exceptional | Trunk rear seat offer plenty of room | Ride in the city is a little sloppy compared to the Maxima | 
 "words": Purchased used with 17000 miles | avg about 25 MPG in mixed mostly Hwy | Very comfortable | Great car | We will probably purchase another | We know a lot of tall people
 "words": I traded a 2006 Sonata GLS 4-cyl for this car | I was also looking at a 2009 Sonata 4-cyl Limited | After driving the Azera there was no comparison | I got the Azera with 15k on it for 1000 less than the Sonata Limited would have been | even after 4500 in rebates | The Azera is a solid car with a quiet ride | Only over certain types of broken pavement could the suspension be a little more supple | The 3 | 8 liter engine is very quiet and goes almost unheard up until 4500 rpm | The engine is very strong throughout the powerband | The 5-speed auto is smooth though shifts could be a bit more swift | The gas mileage averages only 2-3 MPG less than my Sonata 4-cyl | 
 "words": I have only 10500 miles on this car I find it Nice to drive but not up to the standards I was expecting | The gas mileage is disappointing but does fall within Hyundai's spec when using gasoline without ethanol which lowers the mileage by around 3 | 5 mpg | I find the wind noise a little excessive | Handling is great it is hard to clean the paint | I have problem with slight shake while car is cold goes away as soon as engine warms | The am radio has very very limited reception dealer says this is normal | Overall I find the car not worth the price | I have driven many cars many thousand miles I rate this one average | Walter
 "words": All features work well and car handles well | I now have about 13K miles on the car and the front rotors already show signs of wear | The dealer indicated that this was due to the hardness of the brake shoes | It would look as though the rotors would already need to be turned | Has anyone else had this issue | Gas mileage is less than impressive | 
 "words": I have 20000 miles on my 2008 azera limited | This is a lot of car for the money | It is quiet smooth comfortable and with great performance from the 3 | 8l v-6 | It has been perfectly reliable | There are no rattles or squeaks anywhere and it feels like it will stay that way forever | My children love the back seat comfortable seats with lots of room | The truck is huge | All of the controls are logically laid out and I did not have to go to school to figure everything out | I Cruise at 72 78 on the interstate and the car is stable quiet great visibility all around and I average 25 26 mpg at this speed | I love the styling it is understated but classic | 
 "words": I needed a quiet comfortable car that I take on long trips | I looked at luxury models including Lexus and Mercedes | For about 15K less the Azera compares favorably | It's smooth and powerful and most importantly quiet | Gas mileage is decent about 21-22 around town and 27 on the highway | Quality is outstanding | And the engine is responsive and powerful | 
 "words": I like others went to get a Sonata | I'd researched the vehicle thoroughly and found it to be just what I wanted | I climbed in and thought it fine but my girlfriend thought it looked a little small | the salesman then took us on a test drive of the Azera and it was love at first drive | The ride comfort and extras teat come in the Lilmited edition put the car right up against the stiffest competition | I cannot say enough good things about the car | 
 "words": Great value | I'm not sure why but I was able to buy this vehicle for about 3000 below dealer cost | I've never driven a new car off the lot and have the ability to go trade it in for a profit | That aside what a find | Great power smooth ride awesome sound system sunroof navigation | My wife drives a BMW X3 and I prefer to drive this vehicle | That pretty much sums it up | 
 "words": I bought my 2008 Hyundai Azera in June of 2008 | And so far with about a month and a half of driving the car I still enjoy the ride and its features | It took me a while to find out all the features it had | The ride is smooth and the comfort is great with leather seats | I really enjoy the LG Navigation system this way I won't get lost anymore | There were a number of reviews I read before and after buying the car and overall they speak well of the car however they point a little about the steering | I find the handling and steering to be fine | I guess the only thing I could complain about is that there are a few squeaks and rattles from the car when going over bumps which is annoying | 
 "words": I spent a lot of time on line researching the purchase of a second car | Hyundai warranty is very persuasive | Had all the intentions of getting a 09 sonata limited with the navigation option | After a very satisfying demo of the sonata I made the mistake of sitting in a 2008 leftover azera | This car wowed me right away | After some negotiating I was able to purchase the azera limited with the ultimate nav | Option for an out the door price of 27500 | This made it about 2500 more than the sonata and it is very well worth it | It is a beautiful ride and you really need nothing more | 
 "words": We went to the Hyundai dealership to look at the Sonata and while it is a great car was not big enough for our family | We the looked at the Azera and drove it | We found that the car drove and ran excellent | More power than the Sonata and my 6'1 son can sit behind me in the back seat and still have leg room | The car rides excellent looks great and gets decent gas milage considering it's size and horsepower output | At many thousands of dollars less than the competition this car sticks out as an EXCELLENT alternative | The warranty doesn't hurt anything either | 
 "words": An excellent car | We rented the Azera for a trip around the Northwest | I was initially skeptical about having a Hyundai even with only 7 miles on it but that wore off immediately | We could fit 5 suitcases a full size stroller folded in the trunk and two kids in the back seat comfortably | Our round trip was from Portland around the Olympic Peninsula to Seattle and back to Portland | Whether cruising on 101 or climbing mountain roads to over 5000 feet the Azera gave a smooth comfortable and powerful ride | MPG was quite reasonable for a full size car | 
 "words": I love the car | Drives really smoothly and has great acceleration | All the safety features are great because I pick up my kids from school so now I can feel more comfortable knowing that they are more protected | Looked at the Avalon maxima acura tl and merc | C300 series | For the price I got the most with the azera and I have the safety net of the 10 year warranty | Definitely give it a test drive and it will be on your short list as well | 
 "words": I get so many people that look at my car | I get mileage in the high 20s | And now they have the option of the navigation | And its great | Love the wood and the power folding mirrors and the rain sensing wipers | I also like the seat memory for the mirrors and sterring wheel | And the sunshade in the back is great | Best price for this much stuff | 
 "words": I have driven my new Azera for 3 weeks | So farI love it | Powerfulsmoothnoiseless ride | I wanted the white But not in stock | I purchased the Titanium Blue | How lucky was I | The blue is soooo rich looking | To own a car for 10-20000 dollars less than I was expecting to pay is a huge bonus | Hyundai makes a fine product | I | Will write a comment in about 6 monthsafter the break in period | 
 "words": This will be my third Hyundai | We have come up the line from elantrasonata and now the azera | This is an excellent riding vehicle | Very quiet | There is some road noise but I'm attributing that to the tires | Not a lot of people who rated this car like the michelin mxv4 plus tires | I will be taking them off | It handles wellgreat pickup from the engine | Veryvery roomy | Great trunk space | The basic stereo system could use more power | The XM portion doesn't come through very loud | The steering wheel volume control are kind of hidden | Still these are minor problems that wouldn't stop me from buying another azera | It shouldn't stop you either | Take one for a spin |
