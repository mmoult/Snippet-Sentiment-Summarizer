REVIEWS
 "words": Due to the growing size of our family a car that seated 6 or more was in order | We did not want a minivan already had an SUV wanted a wagon or something that drove more like a car for our long road trips to the beach | This Crossover gives everyone their own room and plenty of it with a nice smooth ride | Bought used and it was well worth the price new was out of our league plus it has the Warranty so Mercedes service fixes almost everything | 
 "words": We traded in our Porsche Cayenne for an R350 due to passenger limitation in the Porsche | The Mercedes offered a spacious interior with comfort and luxury as well as easy maneuverability | The engine can be sluggish to start but the ride is smooth once you get going | If you're tall you may want to think twice as there is little clearance between my head and the interior roof of the car without moving the seat all the way down | The sun visor is also tricky to put down without having to move my head back | Difficult to get used to after having 2 suv's with more height and flexibility | 
 "words": I am coming from a 2007 Escalade ESV and have to say I had a lot of reservations about downsizing | We have 4 kids 2 of which in car seats and wow is all I can say about this car | I love that the 2nd row seats can move back and forth allowing for very easy access to the 3rd row which seats my 6ft plus 15 year old very nicely | The pick up is great and it is tons of fun to drive | Not too mention very pleasing to the eye to look at | I would say so far my only con is that it seems to have a lot of little things go wrong | Less then a month of owning it the steering column broke in my kids school parking lot and I could not turn the wheels which was scary to say the least | 
 "words": This is our 2nd R-class and our umpteenth Benz | We had a R350 and an E- class in LA and now that we've moved to Jakarta we decided to get another one this time a 7 seater and CDI to combat Jakarta's traffic | Having first bought a Toyota Alphard here we now find it too big for self-drives and prefer the R-class | The 7 seating version makes better sense and more practical | We've now passed-on the Alphard to the kids for their activities and keep the R-class between my partner and me | We're no longer getting an S-class since the R- class also carries a lot of panache and grandeur without being too overbearing especially when we self- drive on the weekend and during vacation and not use the drive
 "words": Pro | s I had an BMW X3 and drove the X5 along with the MDX the MB had the smoothest ride best safety features BMW doesn | t have third row curtin airbags 3 rows of seating and the greatest comfort in the third row | Pricing was excellent got almost 16K off a brand new 08 and low 66 month 2 | 9 financing | Everything top of the line quality metal feels thick strong and confident on the road | MB originally wanted to sell these in 06 for 60-80K | This was built to be a great cruiser like the s class | Feels like the s class and the panoramic roof is incredible | Cons Navi not easy to use 
 "words": My wife and I were in the market to replace our Yukon XL 4x4 | We were looking at the GMC Arcadia and Buick Enclave when at the time I became aquainted with an R350 at our research lab for vehicle design and repairability review | With all of the safety features this car provided along with the amazing interior room the R class was just right for my family of 5 | I am a first time MB buyer so this may be the last one I buy or the first of many | We are so very pleased with the vehicle | It drives like a cloud | We thought we would miss the Yukon but those memories are gone | This car provides for all of our needs and then some | We just love this car | 
 "words": My title says it all | The R-Class is the vehicle you grow to after the kids are too big for a van anymore | Teens now drive they're too cool and big to be climbing in a van and this is just perfect | There's room for the drums and trips to the warehouse stores | It's not too tall so you don't get dirty getting stuff out of the back | It's better than a modern wagon | It's better than a van | It's better than I could ever imagine | Mercedes Benz is right on for the people that this was designed for but missing the marketing boat | They really need to interview some of us late 40's crowd | Have hand issues | Weak wrists | Carpal tunnel | You'll love how you shift gears in this jet | Lightly tap a button | 
 "words": We were looking for a vehicle which could accommodate a 7 member family | We love the R-class and comfort of Mercedes | It's absolutely quiet inside and got decent accelaration for such a vehicle | Overall I give it a 100 score
 "words": We were looking for passenger room and better fuel economy than our Suburban and were very interested in a diesel | This vehicle looks sharp seats 6-7 very comfortably and I couldn't be happier driving it | We average 28 mpg with highway driving and about 23 in town | With the back seat down there is good storage space and when using the back seat for passengers no one complains about the comfort back there as they did in the Suburban | We are thrilled with this vehicle | 
 "words": You'll love this vehicle if you have tweens | Those teens that are not licensed to drive alone so you still have to haul them and their high school buddies one or two more years | These teens have outgrown the 'soccer mom's van' and they too want to look cool if they are still going to have to be chauffeured by Mom or Dad | The driver will love saving your wrists and joints by just having to tap with your finger the steering column wand to change gears | 26 mpg is a deal sealer on this large vehicle | This is such a wonderful vehicle | You need to market to true baby boomers and tween families such as I described | CALL this vehicle a WAGON | and it ain't yo' mama's wagon of the past

 "words": This car drives and rides like a car but has large seating 7 capacity and good storage availibility for whatever | It's handling is exceptional considering its size | This is one outstanding vehicle | My R is a CDI which gives me lots of power and good mileage for a 5000 lb | car | 
 "words": Bought this car after an exhaustive research process into every car with 3 row | Did not want giant SUV Suburban Esalade and biggest new Lexus did not have comfy back row | R-Class is extremely comfy in all rows | Middle row even shifts forward allowing additional room in the rear if desired | Car runs very smoothly as one would expect from a MB | Middle row appears to have as much leg room as an S-Class and more head room | We opted for the center seat which is good for child but not full width | Cargo space with all seats in place is okay but not great | Rear seats manually fold flat like a minivans | MB did away with the 5 | 0 litre engine | 3 | 5 is sluggish and a disappointment | 
 "words": We were looking for a vehicle which could accommodate a 6 member family | Test drove most of the vehicles and finally ended up on the best one | We just love the class and comfort of Mercedes | Though I am bit skeptical about the Merc's notorious reliability everything is fine so far | It's absolutely quiet inside and got decent accelaration for such a heavy vehicle | Overall I give it a 95 score
 "words": My previous car was an E350 MB | While I loved the handling and styling of the car I chose the R-class for the room and seating capacity | However I was also surprised with the way the car handles and I really love the styling | I pretty much leave the rear seats down but I like knowing that they are available if needed | I love how long the cargo space is with the 2nd row laid down for extra room If I need to haul longer items | Right now with the great lease and retail programs they have on the R- class it makes it a great value | 
 "words": We had a Mecedes wagon with a rear seat but were looking for a vehicle with a larger interior | We also waited for the 2008 that created a 3 person seat in the second row | This vehicle has been everything my wife has wanted and she can handle its size even in tight locations | She loves to drive it | I happen to like to drive it as well | With all the SUVs on the road and having two younger children we feel much safer in this vehicle even over the MB wagon | The long wheel base makes for a very smooth drive and ride even in the 3rd seat that two adults can sit comfortably in | This is definitely a vehicle worth test driving | It will make you strongly consider it as a purchase option | 
 "words": I practically stumbled across this car when I decided to check out the MB lot just for the heck of it one day | We had been looking closely at the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave but I was blown away by the interior size comfort and luxury touches of this vehicle | Our R class includes fantastic features such as the backup camera panorama roof awesome 6 CD changer Sirius radio for 6 months and the 7 seat option | The car rides very well and the torque makes up for what the HP lacks | Although I should say with three kids I want exactly looking for massive power more for interior space and three rows of seats which the R class has in spades | 
 "words": This car a fantastic family verhicle | Not only does it ride like a Mercedes S-Class but it has the same unrivaled leg room even in the third row | I love th ease of converting from three rows to two and back the only car I know where this can be done with one hand from the rear of the car while loading | You will love riding this car and long road trips will be a breeze | 
 "words": We are so happy with this car | We chose it over the LR3 | MDX | XC90 | Q7 | It's smooth spacious and solid | It's got the space inside that others have wasted | This is a well designed and very unique car | I would buy again | 
 "words": At first I went to get a 4 door sedan therefore I was hesitant to get what I thought of as a minivan in disguise | But the more I drive it the more I love it | I like the way it handles both on the highway and around the city | It feels like a Mercedes Benz car not a minivan or truck | People love the back seats and the plentiful leg room available | The diesel model which I have is giving me great mileage per gallon of gas | I love that the seats in the back can be arranged in different configurations very versatile | It is very luxurious inside | The sound system is excellent | 
 "words": We needed a family vehicle that could seat 6-7 people comfortably and still provide space for baby gear groceries or luggage | We wanted a cross-over type of vehicle not a monster SUV and something that still provided luxury safety and performance | I have been an Audi driver for the past five years so comfort performance and safety were key | After looking at a number of vehicles we decided to look at the R Class | The Audi Q7 didn't cut it with cubic space | I am very pleased with the key factors I had to consider and extremely happy with the space we were seeking | We chose the P1 package with a couple of extras the I-pod hook up I love and heated seats |
