REVIEWS
 "words": Took car in for 20K check up after having it inspected 6 months earlier | Found out that my rear brakes and rotors are bad | Asked how rear rotors would go bad after 20K miles | Was told manufacturing issue but they were not responsible | Also need new tires after 20K | Want to buy American but looks like Toyota may be getting a new customer | 
 "words": I have owned Ford's for the past 30 years and I must say this is by far the best one | Among those Fords was a Lincoln Town Car signature series loaded and theis Taurus has it beat by a mile | Gas mileage is great 29 hwy 22 city | There is more room in this car then in the conversion van I use to own | Comfort is beyond reproach | I always buy used cars about one or two years old and add on extended warranty | I do not think hope I will need my 100000 mile warranty on this vehicle | It is just great | Ford you need to bottle this up and keep it on the shelf for future models | Now is I could only figure out how to put a SHO engine from a 2010 into this 2008 I will be happy | 
 "words": I liked the Taurus from the first time I saw it | Not impressed with the gas mileage though | I average 18mpg | The engine is strong smooth ride plenty of interior room and trunk space nice stitching on the seats | The stitching is darker than the camel color seats I have which makes cleaning easier | The trunk space has as much room as my 2007 Explorer minus the height | I am totally satisfied with this vehicle | 
 "words": My first Taurus was a 97 model | It currently has over 215k miles on it with no major issues and is still going strongwe did not trade it in | That's the main reason we decided on the Taurus when it was time for another vehicle | We have only had it a few months but we are well pleased with the new design | It's comfortable on long trips even for my 6ft frame and is a pleasure to drive | The dual air multi disk cd changer and other new amenities make road trips much more comfortable | The huge trunk also makes it easier to bring everything we need | 
 "words": I purchased a one year old Taurus SEL with leather and the major convenience group auto climate control 6 CD changer etc | Overall I have been extremely pleased with the car absolutely no problems | I have a couple of previous Tauruses most recently an '06 SEL and there is no comparison to the current version | The older cars were OK but they were basically appliances to get you from point A to point B | The current version is much more refined favorably comparing to near-luxury cars such as the Toyota Avalon and for a bargain price | No kidding when guests ride in the car they are surprised to find out it's a Taurus | 
 "words": I bought a used '08 Taurus with 1K miles | I think that this is a very underrated car | The interior is well finished with lots of features | Power is decent and fuel economy is better than expected | This is a lot of value for a VERY affordable price | It is a better car than Camry and Altima | It is very spacious in both interior and trunk | Drive one before you buy Japanese and you might be in for a surprise | 
 "words": I've only had this car now for five weeks and I'm really getting to enjoy its comfortable ride | Although I'm the only one in the household I chose this vehicle because of its high rating its likable style in and out | It's a fun car to drive and can't wait to take it on a trip | MPG for me are 24 mixed city highway hoping for 30 on the highway | 
 "words": I am so happy with my first domestic | This has been the most reliable car I've owned better then Toyotas and VWs I have owned | Almost 30K miles and just perform maintenance | Highway mileage is best at 60- upper 20's city is not great but this is a 2 ton plus car 4075 with AWD loaded -CD article with 263 horsepower larger than any Toyota or Honda by 400-500 pounds with AWD so gas mileage for its size is commendable | It is not a Corrola or camry 4 cylinder and honda and Toyota V6 cars including the Avalon are much smaller regardless of class 400-500 pounds and they do not offer AWD | Taurus feels more stable at fast highway speed especially with cross winds than other sedans | 
 "words": Getting 26mpg at steady speed of 62mph | I assume those getting better mileage have 2wd version | Performance adequate | Main reason to purchase this car was that leg room in rear seat even with driver seat back is excellent | We were unable to find any other sedan with enough leg room that even average adults can ride in the back seat for extended trips | They all seem to have yielded this market to mini-vans which I don't car for | Can't figure out lack of automatic headlight switch | Even our 10000 cheaper Chevy Cobalt had that | Now we are out of the habit of turning on lights at dusk and catch ourselves driving with them off at unsafe times | Nature's ugliest shade of brown on dash | 
 "words": Bought as a replacement for my gas hog it was like getting a raise | 24- 27 mixed driving | I am 6-2 280 and full size teen agers all fit with room to spare more than my Tahoe had | So far never back to dealer for anything | Has been an excellent car | 
 "words": I've had my Taurus SEL for 1 year and 2 months and put 17K miles on it | Other than the engine noise around town the reliability I like the car but the reliability is to the point I'm looking to buy Toyota or Honda | I get 24 on the highway unlike 30 as others say | The good Nice design | Nice interior | Nice headroom | Good long distance car | The bad In the year I had it it's now been in the shop 8 times to fix problems | Currently in shop for 2 days to fix loud tapping noise when air is turned on off | Last week it was in shop for 2 days to replace bearings on struts | A month before replaced other bearings | all for squeak grinding noise | Replaced rubber seal around door | 
 "words": We still own a 1994 taurus and when we need a new car we bought this one | My what a great car and its american | It is very quiet which was one of the most important factors as we looked around | The new engine seems to have plenty of power | The only thing I don't like is I wish it had more room for your feet | Other than that the steering wheel tilt is kind of strange two postions | My old Taurus has more | 
 "words": I drive 42k miles a year so yes I drive a lot | After having some unexpected problems with my Camry I figured I'd give a Ford a try | Let me start out by saying this was a replacement for an 07 Camry XLE V6 | My wife has a 08 Accord EXL | First of all it is so much more comfortable my mileage is 28 | 5 on the highway and 20 in town | It has power to spare | It runs and drives worlds ahead of both my Camry and my wife's Honda | My Camry had 88k on it when I traded it in | Many problems with engine cv issue had rotors replaced under warranty and tranny leaked at 85k | Was not cheap to repair | I am approaching 102k and have never seen a dealer for anything but regular maintainence | Unreal
 "words": Although this it's technically my mother's car I do most of the driving and this car is amazing | I had a '92 Taurus and this car is light years beyond it | The engine is smooth and powerful you can't hear it running I have to look at the tach to make sure sometimes | Very good fit and finish as well interior is comfortable but my only gripe for the whole car is that the driver's side needs more room for your feet side to side | AWD is great I was driving through snow banks where my old FWD got hung up every time with ease | No wheel slippage that I could even detect | Perhaps the best thing is the command seating | You sit high and can see almost like you're in a pickup it's great | 
 "words": I had a 2005 500 AWD which was an excellent car | Bought it used ex rental I drove it until 2008 and never put a penny into it except normal services | During that time I got 30mpg on the highway at posted speeds | If you put your foot down the mileage dropped like everything else on the road | Best big car I have had | In 2008 I had promised myself a new 500 | When Ford changed the name I pretty well gave up until I tried it out | The car is not much different than the 500 except the trans and engine | Otherwise the Taurus is a 500 | I have the sel AWD which handles better than anything else I have including a 2007 F150 4X4 | This truck I leave parked during the winter and drive the car | Best car yet
 "words": In nearly 11000 miles I have found the car to be excellent | With 60 yrs 900000 miles of driving experience in all makes of automobiles I consider it one of the best cars I have ever purchased | It is comfortable roomy quiet smooth reliable safe and peppy | I get 27 mpg hiway 23 | 3 overall I'm not a slow driver | Appearance very good finish superb both in out | I'm baffled how your review can be so negative | I disagree with almost every rating e | g | brakes are not mushy | I find them to be quick very effective | Same for steering precise with litle body roll stable on all road conditions | 
 "words": This car has an incredible amount of interior room front and back seats and a huge trunk | Ride is very quiet and handling acceleration is good | Fuel economy is decent for a car of this size | I am averaging 20 city 27 highway | I change my own oil and the placement of the oil filter is very convenient | I've had too many other cars where the filter is hard to reach or it is placed so that oil drips everywhere once removed |

 "words": What a wonderful car | Always liked the look of the 500 more so the Taurus and the safety features on this car are second to none | I have the Safety Security Package Comfort Convenience Package and the Reverse Sensing System | All of which were absolutely worth it | Looking for something to stuff a couple of child seats into and lug around the necessary stuff too | My friends chuckled at me when I got it | That is until I took them for a spin in it and then it was Wow | My wife liked it so much she went out and got a Taurus X a month later | Fords have come a long long way and their tag line is spot on | Drive one indeed | 
 "words": While it's a sharp looking car it's still a Ford | Disappointing highway mileage 26 mpg is the biggest issue to me | Engine noise is a little to high and the interior quality looked a little cheap and my cloth seats and plastic trim are already showing signs of wear and I take care of this car | I'm having transmission shift problems as is another person I know who has one and the car just developed a coolant leak that the dealer had to put dye in the coolant to find out where it's coming from | It is a sharp looking car though | 
 "words": Wow | Lots of room | I have the leather trim and moonroof which adds to the comfort | The trunk space is awesome for bat bags and luggage | If you need a safe full size sedan this is a great choice

 "words": I traded my 04 Mustang GT in for this car I needed a back seat so I know power | The Taurus will accelerate decently if you put your foot down with force but the mpg really suffers | The Limited series has a quality feel to the interior and the tech system is impressive especially with the nav and synch | The exterior styling is less impressive but I was after more space and the car delivers that well | Gas mileage is tricky | I was actually getting better mileage with my GT in town | On the highway I notice that if I drive steady at 70 mph I get about 22 | 5 mpg | cruising at 65 I get about 24 | 5 | and at 62 tried today I get about 26 mpg | Not sure what speed gets 30 mpg 55 maybe | 
 "words": I indicated in my first review 8 months ago that poor fuel mileage might be a deal killer although I liked the car very much | My mileage has improved significantly since my first road trip in January | In June my round trip mileage from an identical 2000 mile route improved over 4mpg to almost 31 | The difference could be due to winter vs | summer conditions and break in | My car was new during the first trip | Now I am happy to report that highway fuel economy is excellent | Town mpg's continue to be a little disappointing | Overall I have found my Taurus to be an excellent road worthy car expecially for a 6'5 guy like me |

 "words": More than enough power | Shifts are incredibly smooth | smoother than the 2008 LE-V6 Camry I drove recently | probably the smoothest transmission I've ever experienced actually | Engine noise is very muted | most of what you do hear is the exhaust note which is quiet but has a nice sound to it very smooth yet husky | Handling is secure and the ride is very smooth without being floaty | Brakes respond nicely without much extra pedal travel | Sync is a pleasure | Seats are broad and supportive but lack much side bolstering | Makes for easy entry exit but doesn't hold you tight in corners | The leather is soft and perforated | Stereo sound quality from the more basic 6CD system is great | 
 "words": I have used this wonderful sedan for a year | It is quiet smooth and very comfortable | I am sure if Ford continues this direction it will get back to its previous place in the market | I used to have many Japanese cars and thought never bought an American one | But this Taurus my first try on American cars has proved that Ford can make a good car if it wanted to | The Taurus is the kind of car everyone wants high performance comfort affordable price and save a lot of gas | On my last trip from San Jose to Los Angeles I have got 30mpg with use of the cruise control | 
 "words": This car replaced a 2002 performance package Crown vVc and is the only car we liked when shopping for a new car | It drives like a much larger car and feels like a rear wheel drive car | We dislike front wheel drive torque steer common in so many of today's cars | The Taurus has none of that and has great road manners | I know it's not the fastest or the sportiest but it represents great a great balance of comfort performance utility and economy | To me that is the mark of a great car | This is a great car |
