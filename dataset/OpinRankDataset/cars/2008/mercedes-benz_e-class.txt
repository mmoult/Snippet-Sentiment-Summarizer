 "words": This is the ultimate hauler | I use it for my daily commuter car and weekend trips with family and dog | Why get an SUV when this does it all | Looked at the Porsche SUV but it had less room and was not as fast | Handles fantastically but no too jarring unless the handling set on hardest setting | The best part is I will probably never see another one going the other way on the road | 
 "words": I traded up from a 06 CLK 350 in the spring of 09 | Love the car with the exception of two minor issues | Firstly is the impossible task of keeping the mags clean drives me crazy | The other is dripping of water into the trunk when the body os wet either from the weather or just washing | Minor issue bur when you spend this kind of money you would expect these issues to have been solved | 
 "words": I tinkered around with moving to a car from a SUV for several years | I began looking at Infiniti's Lexus's BMW's and even Porsche's | The main draw of the E350 was the 4Matic feature | I am a work-aholic and don't like to miss work due to weather | After I found one at a local dealer I took it out for a spin | Oh my was it impressive | I loved the looks | I loved the power | I loved the comfort and fit | It was smooth and powerful | The seats are very supportive | The tranny is smooth and agile and the ride is perfection | After only months of ownership I am convinced I made a great choice | I haven't had it serviced yet which makes me a bit nervous | However I expect a great experience | 
 "words": Bought my E350 just a few months ago and have approximately 1100 miles on it | What more can I say about the car except fantastic | This is my first Mercedes and am nothing but impressed with the E350 | The ride is very luxury like although it does have some sport mixed in too | Interior is comfortable with very supportive front seats and a rear seat that is acceptable for two people | The nav system although an older design is still easy to use and is functional | All switchgear is top rate and the wood trim looks expensive but not over done | Even though the seats are MB tex they still look like leather and feel great | Would purchase another Mercedes | 
 "words": Bought new E350 in may the car performs very well | Expect a rapid depreciation the first 6 months of about 40 | Purchased in May for 53000 trade value in December was 29000 with a peak of 30000 | Car is pristine | Tried to trade for an 09 could due to the depreciation | 
 "words": Looking at Consumer Reports I was very concerned with the reliabilty of purchasing a MB as 2004-2006 quality rating were dismal | However my wife always wanted a Benz and glad we did | Car rides and drives like a dream | Best brakes and overall very solid | It's been 18 months with 20k miles without any incident other than having the oil changed | 
 "words": Great car | Comfortable smooth sports car handling excellent craftsmanship incredible power | Not as quiet as the gas engine but very quiet for a diesel | You have to listen to hear it | I average 25mpg as much as 38 mpg on the road | However the GPS stinks | It's the worst | Difficult to use and I dont need to find border crossings in the USA | Just buy a Garmin a 100 times better | Problems transmission tends to clunk into lower gear as you slow down | Had a 2005 Benz with the same problem | Price of diesel a negative | Hate the center console holds nothing | Service very expense | I would however buy this car again | 
 "words": I have had the car for a while now and this car is really fun to drive | Lexus's cars are rediculously reliable but they're not sports cars they dont have much passion in them | BMW are very sporty by nature but the interior lacks luxury and the iDrive doesn't help | Audi's interior are first rate but the performance lags behind most of its competitors | The E350 is accelerates smooth and swiftly and the engine is also extremely responsive | It also incorporates everyday practicality | This interior is absolutely beautiful Mercedes understands how to incorporate chrome to make the interior look modren and stylish while still retaining the classic Mercedes interior look | Its Just a great car |

 "words": I have owned several Mercedes most recently C280 and then an E320 | The E350 4-matic is the run away best | From the outset it has a better ride firmer integrity and high comfort | In some ways it has moved closer to S-class feel and ride not all the way | The interior seems much roomier than my previous 2003 E320 even though the specs are only a bit roomier | The additional of 4-matic has been awesome for me in the Midwest comparable to the moving power of my spouse's ML in snowy conditions | I look forward to trips I added iPod integration and the sound is totally amazing resembling fixed speakers | Sound far exceeds radio satellite radio | iPod control on wheel is a bit tricky | 
 "words": Braking noise quirks have been completely resolved from earlier E models | In factbraking is excellent in terms of both feel' response at any speed including into curves | Steering has now a really nice degree of response at both high low speed | Fit finish just beautiful | Although car not broken in yet I'm getting 10 | 8L 100km about 27 mpg highway without using cruise-control 120kph 75 mph | Extra power available through all speeds | Seat comfort very good | Paint exterior fit integrity excellent | Quiet interior | Cargo area large usable | Audio phone car computer controls on steering wheel easy to learn | Heat cool systems accurate | 5 speed transmission nice | Road feel is there but not harsh | 
 "words": Awesome car | I've owned 1998 and 2002 E320 4Matics and this car blows them away | I have the sport model | The ride is incredibly smooth Nav is good as is the radio | If price is a consideration ask the dealer for an RDR car | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle last week and have driven 500 miles to date | Saturday I drove some rugged mountain roads and found the car ro handle great | Mileage was good but not enough experience to judge accurately | The seats are not as comfortable as the Lexus I traded and the cabin is smaller | Leg support could be improved | Like lthe ride and handling | 
 "words": Clean strong and fast for a big car that gets 26MPG average and 35MPG on the highway | No odor or smoke ever truly amazing | I have had it about a year now with no problems | I did upgrade to the 18 wheels for looks | The stock 16 ones were quiet and smoother ride | 
 "words": Overall a great car if smooth quiet and solid are what one is looking for | Not sporty but high-quality luxury | Very good acceleration if needed from a stop although requires a long pedal to really make it move | Looking better and better as this generation evolves | Very good stock automotive HK sound system | Absolute pleasure to drive wish I had gotten a 15k-18k lease instead of 12k | Custom- ordered fully loaded except panoramic sunroof which is not needed in Arizona besides the standard sunroof is pretty big |
