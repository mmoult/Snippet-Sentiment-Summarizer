REVIEWS
 "words":  Bought the last 2008 adrenalin the dealer had and so far i'm very impressed | Got every option and colorado red paint with 20'' wheels | With only 1000 miles so far I really like the ride and handling of this truck | Its a little underpowered even with the v8 maybe thats because my other car is a z28 with an LT1 It looks alot faster than it is | A great looking truck that has everyone asking what model is that | did it come new like that | Smooth as silk ride and drive with decent milege from a 4500lb truck 16 | 9 mpg so far definately a head turner | At 46 ive had a lot of cars and this one is up top of the list | 
 "words": Got a fantastic deal on the adrenalin model at Christmas | Had Acuras since 1989 but they were not motivated to sell me a vehicle | Brand loyalty meant nothing to them | We enjoy sitting higher when driving | This truck provides a tremendous sense of security in winter driving situations | The 6-speed tranny is smooth and the V8 is very flexible | The independent rear suspension gives a much more impressive ride over rough roads compared to the Chevy Silverado I rented last year for a weekend | Fuel economy so far is acceptable at 15-20 mpg in winter driving | I'm expecting a seasonal improvement to 20-26 mpg when the weather warms up like my Acura TL does | We enjoy driving this truck immensely | Recommend just adding sunny days and a favourite recreational activity | This truck has style power and tremendous versatility | Big grins | It's a keeper | 
 "words": Have had my Trac since August have loved it so far | Had a Focus before this so there was a little bit of an adjustment period but it's all been good | Love the rubberized floor | It's a breeze to clean | Could have done a lot better with the MPG though 
 "words": What in the heck are they thinking in Detroit | Ford has been making trucks for well on 100 years | This is the most uncomfortable truck I have ever been in | This truck is provided as a work vehicle and I hate to get in the thing | The YukonXL I was in previously was by far a more comfortable good riding truck | This SUV while being a smaller body has no excuse not to have a more comfortable and well designed seat at least | Then add the cheap cheap leather and interior which looks like its a year old already and I can see why the big three reps apologized for building cheap cars | This wasn't cheap but it sure is built that way | Fit and finish | What a joke | Never again Ford | Never | 
 "words": I couldn't resist buying a brand new showroom leftover Adrenalin taking advantage of Ford employee discounts | Traded in a 05 Silverado SE Special Edition Extended Cab and there's simply no comparison in quality Ford wins hands down | The ride is tops the look is | well the Adrenalin turns heads everywhere I've gone | Definitely buy the Navigation option with Sync | Makes a world of difference | Black interior is nice but I would've enjoyed a two-color treatment | Still this car truck combination is versatile sporty smooth cool a real winner | Might be the best vehicle I've ever owned and I've had many | 
 "words": I have this vehcle about a month and thus far it is great | The Sport Trac seems the perfect fit as I wanted something between a full size pick up and a compact | The bed's a little small but still capable of hauling 4x8 sheets when fitted with a couple 2x4 in the notches in the bed | The interior is roomy and comfortable | Not extravagant but I am still satisfied | MPG could be improved so far getting 16mpg but would prefer if Ford could up that to 20 | The V6 has been adequate and the 5 speed auto is smooth | satelite radio is nice | The molded bed w compartments and tiedowns is well designed | Overall look is very appealing | 
 "words": I've never been a Ford fan always preferred GM or Toyota products | Test drove this and was impressed with how solid it felt and the quietness of the cabin | 
 "words": I was a Ford hater and never would have considered buying one | I was initially looking at the Avalanche and while reading reviews I noticed some positive ones for the SportTrac | I went to the dealership and was also looking at the Expedition but they could not get me the numbers I wanted so I decided to try out the SportTrac | I took a drive in it and was amazed at how well it drove | It's quiet smooth and the V-8 has plenty of go in it | So far I have had it for two months and it's been perfect | My mileage has been about 15-16 overall but that is mostly because I tend to have a little fun now and then | It's the same mileage my CX-7 got and that thing didn't have anywhere near the room | 
 "words": I traded in a 2004 F-150 and got 2008 Limited Sort Trac V8 4X4 limited chrome and electronics | Ford couldn't have done a better job of putting a vehicle together | Great power anywhere you need it I am am happy with my mileage compared to my F-150 V8 5 | 4 | Getting 22mph on highway | Very smooth ride If you're looking for something like this no other manufacturer can even come close to the quality and comfort of the Sport Trac | 
 "words": I will always need some type of truck for hauling and have liked the Sport Trac since the first ones came out | The addition of the V8 and IRS on the latest model was the clincher | Truck has a very comfortable interior | Outstanding ride and handling | I love the excellent overall quality it is very quiet with no rattles or squeaks | For someone that does not a 6' or 8' bed length this truck fits the bill | Tows a 5000 boat very nice and with the traction control goes up the slipperest ramp with ease | With the sales incentives and rebates the price simply cant be beat for a fun full featured loaded 4 door truck | 
 "words": I had read a lot of reviews before I made a purchase | Allow me to say Ford had done a great job | I put black leather in this vehicle as well | Sync and convenience pack came with it along with the tow | First I drove the kids to see family 3 hours away and it drove smooth | The passing issue with power-hey guys turn the OD switch off that will give you more power not that I had a problem | No carpet | Excellent easier maintenance | Plastic inside | Great | Now I dont have to use Armor All-easy to clean with warm water | A sync syst-with Sirius | Let's roll | A class 3 tow package-take the jet skis to the lake up to 5000lbs w elec | Come on | Gas Ford could do better | 
 "words": Bought the vehicle out of necessity | We just had a new baby and needed bigger trunk space | Unfortunately I traded quality for price and ended up paying for it in the end | Good power in the lower gears so you'll get going pretty quickly but then the power drops off quickly once you get into the upper gears | I always had an extremely hard time passing anyone above 50MPH without hammering down the gas pedal | A lot of plastic interior comfortable seats for short drives but horrible on your lower back on drives of 3 hours or more | SYNC feature is horrible | Even speaking slowly and clearly I'd have to repeat myself 2-3 times for the system to recognize what I was trying to say | 
 "words": I have had many vehicles of all sorts | I have been looking at the Sport Trac since it's debut in 2001 but wanted more than the 4 | 0 litre engine | Now with the V8 4 | 6 my dream truck is a reality and the wait was worth it more robust frame suspension IRS better looks plus overall refinements | I am over 6'1 comfort is great | I like the door handles placement appearance and have no issue with the door pulls seats or anything else | The rubber floor covering is much easier to clean than carpet would be | I trailer two large ATVs at highway speeds passing handling is spot on | I am very pleased with my Sport Trac and have recommended it to others friends and family included | 
 "words": I have had lots of Fords over the years but this is one of the best | I traded a 2004 F150 Crew for this and I am as pleased as punch | The 4 | 6 V8 is a power house and delivers basicly the same mpg as the 6 | It is so easy to park garage friendly takes less room is great on the road | It is quiet ride is outstanding no need for rails as in and out access is great | The new Sync by Microsoft and sirus radio makes it a intertainment wonder | No need for cds as one 2mb in the usb will access hundreds of songs with out worry of storage or scratching of cd | The vinyl floor is padded and the cab is quiet | It is a well thought out suv and with current offer of 4000 cash back is a must have | 
 "words": The 2008 Explorer pick-up is perfect for me and my high school aged daughter | I cannot complain about one thing other than gas mileage on the V6 | I guess I would have purchased the V8 just to get the six speed transmission if I knew the mileage would not be all that different although my five speed seems fine for my purposes and the eight cylinder just added to the cost | My leather interior the paint and trim are outstanding | Microsoft Sync and Sirius radio combined with the 6 disc changer gives me so much music through the truck's killer sound system that I don't know quite what to listne to sometimes | I love the handling et | al | Really neat truck for a city boy | 
 "words": The Sport Trac is a great truck SUV | It's great for everyone including familys | This thing has so many features that I don't know where to start | My Kids love it and my wife perfers to drive it over her Mustang and Audi | 
 "words": I traded an '05 Sport Trac 4 | 0 V6 | The '08 w 4 | 6LV8 is far superior and fuel economy is 1 mpg less in town than the 6 | same on hi-way | The ride is like that of a much more expensive truck and the handling and noise levels are top-notch | Sync system can be a problem at times mine has gotten stuck in a RING cycle that forced me to pull over shut everything down and re-start the car | Rear seat legroom is improved over previous model too | This truck is a sleeper and Manf incentives are great | better check it out | 
 "words": I have owned my V6 XLT for three months and I have been very happy with my purchase | I don't need to haul large or heavy objects very often so the small bed works for me | The ride is comfortable and composed | The V6 has plenty of power and everything has been reliable | Ford needs to work on the fuel economy | I am not dissappointed with the mileage but I think Ford could do better | 
 "words": I traded in my '97 Ford F-150 which was the best vehicle I had ever owned | Needed more family room though | Drive alot off road so needed a 4WD | The dealer installed skid plates from Ford and 265 70R17 BF Goodrich Longtrail tires | Lifts the vehicle over an inch vs | stock tires | Truck drives like a luxury ride on the road and has handled real off road trails here in Arizona desert thus far with no problems | It is not the tallest frame for a 4WD but take it careful and the truck will climb anywhere | Mileage is okay at 18 | 5 mpg on highway and 16 | 5 city | 
 "words": I came out of a 2003 4x4 F250 w the V10 | I loved th truck but needed a vehicle with a lower payment and lower fuel bill | The Sport Trac did both | I have really enjoyed the ST | I think the 4 | 0 v6 handles it better than the 4 | 6 v8 handles the F150 | Fuel mileage is avg | about 17 and with the tailgate down my Honda Foreman 4wheeler will fit in the backthe side tie downs come in very handy for this | Would definately recommend this vehicle |
