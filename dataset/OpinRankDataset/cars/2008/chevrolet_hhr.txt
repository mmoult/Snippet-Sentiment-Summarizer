REVIEWS
 "words": My HHR has had wind noise and water leak issues from the first month I have had it | Who wants to pay thousands of dollars over many years for a new car that has been a lemon from the start | It is now leaking for the fourth time and really | wouldn't you think that Chevy would step up and not make me fight for what is right | But they are not | I am going to have to contact a lawyer | That's not customer service | 
 "words": drives excellenttires keep going lownice quiet smooth ride | easy handling | nice stock stereocmfo seatsadjustable armrest | 
 "words": I bought my HHR with 34000 miles on it the only problem i have had is the a c it makes a funny noise when on but other than that it is great | 
 "words": Just purchased used hhr as second vehicle for the family | So far we are enjoying it | Have spent some money on performance upgrades and a set of wheels had to get rid of those ugly hub caps now my son doesn't call it lame looking any more | Could use some help in the interior though | Needs the center arm rests located a little higher so you can place a cup in the holder without having to raise the arm rest and it would also make it a little more comfortable | Please keep up the good work in the design of cool looking little economy cars | Not those lame looking hybribs prius that the competition makes | 
 "words": My 2008 HHR LS is an eye catcher in orange | Black interior is neat stays clean looking longer than lighter colors | All controls super easy to use air radio windows etc | Fuel economy not as good as advertised but okay | The 2 | 2 engine is fine around the city but you have to stomp the gas pedal when pulling on to the highway that is a disappointment would have liked the larger engine we learn from our mistakes | Large easy open tailgate storage area a big plus so easy to load and unload | Cabin is pretty quiet as is the engine | so far | we live in hope | All in all I do like the vehicle would recommend for the price but go to GOOD dealer don't get ripped off as I did | 
 "words": For me this was a great buy | Sure I could have bought a much better car but not at anywhere near this price 2008 used 11k miles under 12g | I have a bad lower back but I can adjust the driver's seat so that I'm comfortable for hours | Mileage is good | Gauge placement is excellent in my previous sedan no matter how I adjusted the steering wheel I couldn't see the speedometer | MP3 connection is a lifesaver on long trips | Visibility could be better | Only 3 cup holders but I have 5 kids | I can't encourage drinking in the car | I also can't encourage them leaving their belongings so I enjoy the absence of a storage console | And when I'm alone I can enjoy a quiet ride | 
 "words": The HHR gets great mileage on long trips about 33mpg however mine is a manual transmission | The interior needs more cup holders there are only three right down the center console | So with that said there are two in the front and only one in the back for rear passengers | This is a very fun car to drive and is very soild like a truck but rides like a car | 
 "words": A BASIC hhr with a 5spd and a2 | 2 no traction control no abs just a plain maroon colored 4door fun car that runs on reg | Gas and gives me a true 30 mpg in the city | Replaced oil with full synthetic and a kn air filter | Bought it new right off the truck has 16000 miles and one visit to the dealer | The hhr has done exactly what I want | It handles great at 75 mph with no wavering behind the big rigs | The steering is sharp and precise however the torque steer is a brute | Behind the driver the available space is amazing | The build quality is on the hi side of good and the paint job was excellent | Overall I'm pleased and oh yes I drive it hard and fast no slakkin in the sun | Gas clutch gone | 
 "words":  A head turner you'd think I have the only black panel hhr in NE ohio | I put custom black wheels on it and that is it | Everyone has something positive to say about it everywhere I happen to park | A friend at work bought one a week after seeing mine | Nuff said there contagious I say | I have to admit I first only bought because I nailed the price | The dealership didn't even fill my tank | I stole it and really didn't care that the only gas left was what I had put in it for my test drive | I don't use cheap gas anyway in my cars there is a difference in performance I don't care what you drive | So the HHR has won me over and the vehicle is perfect for my horse duties the truck stays put | 
 "words": The HHR looks sharp on the outside | Nice curves cool retro looks good paint | However the inside looks like something out of a 1980's era car | Cheap foam plastic that scratches easily covers every inch of the cabin | The standard stereo puts the speakers on the floor so it sounds muddy | Windshield is very small so your field of view is a bit limited | The sunroof works well and the controls for it are well placed | There's also a handy in-dash storage space that holds an IPod GPS sunglasses etc | There are three poorly places cup holders which makes a trip in a car build for 4 interesting back seat is very cramped | 
 "words": I have enjoyed the ride but there is a bit of a blind spot at the edge of the windshield and the side window | Take an extra second to watch for pedestrians | I also see they overestimated gas mileage efficency | I'm about 20 mpg not at all near the 30 24 on the window sticker | I drive mostly in the city so I know that doesn't help | The car size is great for the city but I chose stylish over hybrid because the mileage estimates were the same | I would have stayed with the hybriyd choice had I known the mileage was going to be so far off | It does always get a wow and I never had a car before that did | The double looks it gets have been fun to see | 
 "words": The HHR has been a huge surprise | I paid 14k for a new 2008 ls | It is far suprior to other cars in its class when it comes to usablility and comfort | The most impressive part of this vehicle is how smooth and comfortable the ride is | I travel about 30k a year so I needed a vehicle that would get great gas mileage i avg 33 on highway and was comfortable enought to drive for 5 6 hours in | On top of that the storage area is awesome | Lots of space in the rear witha great changing configuration | 
 "words": I was able to trade in a 08 Scion XB after seeing an 08 orange HHR panel wagon | The drive was smooth | Wish I had purchased it in the first place | The Scion was very limited in color selection had lower MPG tough to see stop lights only one back up light even with a pioneer stereo the sound was not as good as the HHR's | Buying American was nice | I just love the HHR | 
 "words": I have had nothing but sheer enjoyment from this car since I purchased it | The engine is very well powered for a 4-cylinder road noise is much quieter than a lot of other models and MPGs are good considering the amount of storage space and the fact you can easily fit 4 large adults in the car | I read there used to be an issue with stone chipping on previous models however 2008 comes with a thick protective film on the surfaces at risk from stones and that film seems to work great | Even the film doesn't show signs of impact | Only issue has been my auto light sensor failing | Sometimes it won't allow parking and interior lights to come on with headlights | Manual override doesn't work | 
 "words": 6 months 8000 miles | Needed 2 trips to dealer to fix warped brake rotors and drums broken rear hatch latch replaced | paid 19K for a leftovr 07 listed for 23K | The car delivers decent comfort performance for price | It feels reliable motor and trans | are okay | You will not feel or hear motor inside car vibrates less then Japanese cars | Fuel economy is not up to par I am averaging 17 MPG with mostly city driving | I use it for deliveries hauling family stuff etc | Nice fold downs roomy | Rattle free I like the interior very much simple elegant nice fit finish | I am happy although car is far from perfect see suggested improvements below | 
 "words": My 08 LS Auto is fabulous | 2 | 2 motor 149hp is more than adequate despite the heavy vehicle | Ride is soft as expected and comfortable | We use this as a family hauler with two kids 3 and 4 | They can actually get in all by themselves unlike the large SUV guzzlers out there | This is an inexpensive economy vehicle with some flair and modern features | The info panel is fantastic and interior versatility is top notch | GM is offering the goods to the lower price buyers for a change not just the monster SUV crowd | Interior quality is better than expected for price and segment | I think it looks more premium than the msrp commanded | Replacement parts are inexpensive too brakes rotorsetc
 "words": We've had our HHR now one month and we like it so far | Roomy for the kids and I like not having to bend over when putting my 2 yr old in his car seat | Ive been slowly getting used to the design of the windshield kinda small and I keep forgetting where my window controls are and Im a little surprised at the lack of console storage | there is none | There's the small storage bin in the dash but I dont have anywhere to put CD's kleenex and other junk | maybe that's a good thing as my husband would prob say | Okay mpg but not where we want it yet | We plan to change to synthetic oil and a KN Air filter when the oil needs changed | All in all we love the car so far | Very sporty | 
 "words": This is a great car with lots of uses | I bought mine back in November and I love it | It gets decent fuel economy and the driver information center is great for knowing whats going on with the rest of the car | I actually was able to fold the front passenger seat all the way down put a lap top on top of it plug the lap top into the i pod jack and watch movies it was like having a mobile theater | As far as the tan interior goes I would recommend putting a little scotch guard down to help with mess prevention | All in all a great car you will not be disapointed | 
 "words": Worst mistake I ever made in purchasing a car | It's a really nice car to look at but that's it | The all plastic interior just reaks of cheap | The front windshield has you leaning up into the steering wheel to see when the red light changes | No console and thus no decent storage space | The little thing they put on the dash is very lacking | The seats are uncomfortable | The space between you and the passenger is almost non existant | Really cramped feeling | No console between seats and the cup holders are the worst I have ever seen in any vehicle | The arm rest sit too low to be of any use | Window control location is very poor | Rear seat room is very poor | 
 "words": I also own an 05 HHR and they are similar | Opt for the ABS and side airbags | OnStar is super worth the money | This car doesn't do anything super but it doesn't do anything really bad either and I paid 15200 for my 08 with the automatic transmission and one year of on-star | Pinebelt etched my windows for 299 and said it was standard procedure although I didn't really want it | It was a pure money maker for them but the deal was still sweet | If you want a reliable good looking economy car this is an excellent choice and I would buy another one when in the market |

 "words": Got the car a few days ago and am enjoying the ride so far | Ratings are relative to the price and segment | For the price we couldh't have gotten a better car | My wife and I didn't want to get another HoHum sedan at least not until we are pushing 60 and we also wanted a car that seated 4 comfortably with a smooth ride | HHR fit the bill | Car handles better than what I read about it | Not perfect but handles well | I am very happy with this purchase | 
 "words": I think you either love or hate the design of this car | I love it | Funky weird retro | I thought it was unique until I bought one now I see them everywhere | Economical and seemingly well built | Bought the car and put 3K miles on it in two weeks | Took it from GA to FL on a roadtrip | Fun comfortable great gas mileage | I was impressed with the AC too I havent had it long but I did a lot of homework and it seems like a very good car compared to its peers for features and functions | I am glad to be able to buy an American car again | 
 "words": 14 months 18000 Miles | LT2 w 2 | 4L engine | Most fun I've had in 35 years | Demoed the 2 | 2 bought the 2 | 4 engine | Stronger engine fatter tires tighter suspension made it a completely different vehicle | It loves to be driven | Average economy about 27 trips yield 35 | Hard plastic door panels make it easy to knock WI snow off shoes | Installed new studless snow tires all around and winter traction and handling were nearly as good as summer time | I'm 6'2 and I can't sit in ANY car with a sunroof |

 "words": I bought an HHR because I need a practical vehicle with good gas mileage | For those who like the '40s chopped top hot rod look the HHR hits the mark and surely is set apart from its Asian counterparts | I see the hard surfaces in the interior as a virtue since my kids always come back muddy from bicycle sports events and its durable as easy to clean for this purpose | I opted for the SS version that was engineered by GM Performance Division | It handles like a sports car and has the acceleration of a rocket | My experience with actual fuel mileage is about 27 | 5mpg for combined 70 30 hwy city with the 2 | 0L Turbo | I'm very happy with my HHR SS and it fits my specific transportation needs well | 
 "words": We have put 20k miles on this car and are 1 month shy of a year of ownership | We have had 0 problems everything works no repairs | It was bought for my wife but now that we have 3 car seats we had to get a Mini- van so now the HHR is mine | The car is fun to drive and gets great gas mileage we are averaging 26 mpg after a winter of letting the car idle for 5 minutes while it warmed and we loaded up the car seats |

 "words": When my wife I were looking for a commuter car we started at Honda you want how much | went to Toyota Hyundai Mazda Nissan almost went with the Rogue | our last stop was at the good old Chevy dealer as an almost patriotic afterthought but we were pleasantly surprised by the value of this car gets acceptable mileage lots of stock doodads power is adequate but surprising for a 4 banger | With the rear seats folded it holds lots | It can even be used as the family of 4 car or short time replacement when the sport ute or mini van is being serviced | Yep we think it was a great buy and would recommend | Just wish we went with the LT for the better seats don't get the sunroof | 
 "words": I was drawn to the HHR by its combination small-ish size but generous cargo space | I read the reviews pro and con and took a test drive | Initially I wasn't hooked | The test drive was in a loaded LT which made the car too costly and too gadget-laden to make me leery of potentially costly repairs | My interest in the car held however and a year later I test drove an LS with essentially just ABS and side airbags as options std on the '09s | I liked it | Bought it | Have been driving it for 6 months and still am happy | Very comfortable | Handles well | Lots of fun to drive | Took about a week to adjust to the short windshield and blind spots but no big deal | 
 "words": I still really enjoy this car after driving it for about 6 months | I've had no problems at all and have noticed quite a few more on the roads lately | The gas mileage isn't quite what I was hoping for only about 22 mpg doing almost all city driving but I can still go 2-3 weeks between fill-ups | I'm still very happy with the LS model it may not be as fast or as stylish as the LT or SS models but for just driving back and forth to work and around town it works perfectly | 
 "words": I have almost 3000 miles on the SS | Gas mileage is better than expected so far | I commute 50 miles round trip mostly the Katy Freeway in Houston | The last four tanks averaged 26 | 5 mpg actual calculated miles divided by gallons purchased not the car's computer mpg display | My previous vehicle was a 2000 Tahoe a great truck with no problems | The handling and acceleration of the SS is great | I don't have the brake issues other posters have noted | I plan to put a lot of miles on the car | 
 "words": This car has been a pleasant surprise so far | It is much quieter than the Acura RSX that I replaced after the Acura had multiple trans problems and the warranty was over | Honda lost me on that car | The Chevy gets great gas mileage etc | It is hard sometimes to see out of so I have to be sure the power window switches are placed out of reach but no car is perfect | My black lab is in heaven with her head hanging out the right rear window | The stereo is A-OK | Mine is a stick shift because I am a stick shift guy and I am happy with the performance of the trans | The car is quiet rattle free compact good mileage stylish and my dog loves it | I'd buy a another one in a heart beat | 
 "words": I was looking for a retro style car was looking at PT Cruisers when I stopped in to the local Chevy store | I didn't know they were making the SS verison | Drove both and for the extra bucks the turbo is well worth the extra | It's a fun car to drive with the 5 speed | Under hard acceleration have a good grip on the steering wheel there is a lot of torque steer | I guess they have relocated the window switches because mine are on the door and the cup holders aren't covered by an arm rest | My only complaint is my right leg rests against the center console and is uncomfortable other than that I really like the car | 
 "words": I wanted to trade in my Explorer Limited to save on gas and to do that was tough because I loved that truck | I tested the Equinox didn't like gas mileagefor the heck of it look at the HHR and I have never looked back | This car has lots of room to carry stuff and the gas mileage is the best I've ever had in the 30 years I've been driving cars | The only thing I disliked on this car is the window controls but that's been changed for the '09 model I think | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle in May mainly due to 1 an immediate need for a vehicle 2 a desire to get better gas mileage and 3 a very good Memorial Day weekend sale | I have been pleasantly surprised by the vehicle | It is fun to drive and has more pep than I expected | 
 "words": I just purchased this car pretty happy with it so far | In my opinion its a nice car for the money and gets very good gas mileage | Nice and roomy for small family of 4 | I disliked it at first thinking it was going to be like a PT Cruiser and I was wrong and sold when I test drove it | It was exactly what I was looking for | So I suggest if you're thinking about looking for a roomy family vehicle that you can haul stuff if you want then this is the perfect car for you | 
 "words": Wow | I bought my HHR almost 1 year ago and I still love it | It is the first vehicle I have owned that did not have new car bugs or problems | I have not had to take it back to the dealer even once since I bought it | I bought the Victory Red version and the paint still glistens | The interior is holding up very well | The features are amazing for the price range | Gas mileage is excellent | Power to go is there | Handling is good except behind a 18 wheeler on the interstate then you get buffeted around a bit | I would and have recommend this vehicle to my friends |

 "words": I've had the HHR for 2 months now and like it so far | I was in the market for a car with good MPGs and had the versatility of an SUV | While it is not near the size of the Tahoe it has similar functionality with the back seats and front passenger seat folded down | Ideal for trips to Home Depot and such | Averaging 26 to 28 MPGs with the auto trans but will say I'm not a lead foot | I drive 28 miles to work with a fairly even mix of city and hwy driving | The driver's seat is surprisingly comfortable with the power lumbar | I haven't had a 4 cyl in 15 years but it hasn't been a painful adjustment | Overall I am very satisfied with the HHR | It meets my needs for good MPGs and versatility | 
 "words": I traded in an '06 HHR LT2 for this '08 SS and really am pleased with everything but the problem with the brakes | GM took a problematic brake system known as Optimized Hydraulic Braking or OHB for short | This system causes no boost to the brake system on initial start-up after sitting for a few hours | At the present GM has a couple of service bulletin's one of which calls for a software update that lowers engine RPM's to make it easier to stop not pulling through brake application before the vacuum is built back up the other simply advises the tech no part replacement or software updates | See NHTSA investigations and KickingTires 2008 Chevy HHR before purchasing | Also check Saturn Sky | 
 "words": It has been a great car with a few minor problems | At 14000 miles it would make a pop sound when speeding up and slowing down | Sounded like slack between two parts in the power train somewhere | Dealer could find no problem | Now with 20000 on it the pop is louder | The front passenger hub assembly is being replaced | The steering has begun to clunk when turning the wheel and the intermediate steering shaft has been replaced | Sunroof glass is on order to be replaced | When opening the sunroof it drags the underside of the roof and makes cut marks in the glass |

 "words": I purchased my 08 HHR over 2 months ago to take the gas pump burden off my wallet HHR 55 evey 10 days vs 90 every 4-5 days with my Silverado | I now find myself driving this car all the time and my 07 Silverado may get driving only once or twice on the weekends | I drive 35 miles to from work during the week and when I can lock the cruise at 60 the car will get 35-37 MPG | I am a 6'5 tall lbig guy and I have no problems with leg head room no sunroof have the issue seeing the stoplights when first in line | I get a lot of people askng about the car the fuel MPG's the GM Performamce Air Intake makes a huge difference | My neighbor loves my HHR and wants to trade in her PT Cruiser | 
 "words": I have been driving Suburbans for 30 years and finally caved in to the current gas prices | I couldn't face going into a small car and decided to test drive the HHR and found that I really liked it | The ride is comfortable I sit a little higher than a car and the 4cyl engine seems to have enough pickup as I drive on the expressway all the time | After 2 months of driving this vehicle I find it fun to drive and the gas mileage is great | The only undesirable is the loss of power when turning on the air conditioning | 
 "words": I agree with most of the other reviews | It is fun to drive | Great on gas | And many features for the money | The remote start will be nice in the winter | I'm not an autoworker but I would like to see GM make the HHR at the Morine plant that's going to close next year | I think that would be a good move for GM and the people in Morine |

 "words": This is a great car style looks fun | I am a senior who has owned many cars including a 54 Vette SS396 Mercedes etc | The HHR SS is a fun car with great mileage and the best thing- It's a Chevy | I am amazed at how well it handles moves on cue and turns heads | Welcome back GM | Keep making cars like this | I would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": Only have about 2000 miles so far but that includes a couple of nice road trips | The first trip was all 2- lane roads of wildly varying altitudes and lots of corners | The car is very confidence inspiring with excellent grip and crisp steering response | I was a bit surprised at this due to the electric power steering but hey it's just my opinion | Maybe the only handling negative is the amount of corner lean when pressing but considering the car's mission in life not at all surprising | Averaged about 24 | 5 mpg in fairly brisk driving | The second trip was 90 freeway using cruise control | I averaged 28 | 5 mpg over two tanks with average speeds of 75 mph | 
 "words": This vehicle is the perfect combination of practicality and sporty fun | I've only had my new HHR LT Special Edition for a couple of days so I'm not able to rate the reliability or fuel economy yet | So far so good | I love the retro styling very spunky | Even my style-conscious 20 year old daughter approves | My HHR is very quiet and has a smooth ride | I'm impressed with the roomy seating areas as well as the cargo space | It's an added bonus that there are two height options for the cargo 'floor' | The seating is very comfortable | lots of headroom even with the sunroof | Very enjoyable and fun to drive | I compared a lot of vehicles the HHR gives the most for the money | 
 "words": I bought this because it looks good got good gas mileage had enough power and still had some room for gear | The 2k rebate then sealed the deal | This is a nice car and I am glad I bought it | But Chevy could have done a much better job with the poor front window vision tiny glove box few cup holders and better emergency brake placement
