REVIEWS
 "words": About 1 | 5 years of ownership now | Great reliable vehicle | We bought it as the perfect 4 person family car and then got a surprise 3 child and it is not perfect for that but its ok | I added a roof rack and cargo box and thats takes care of storage issues on long trips | I should add I got 28-29 mpg on a recent road trip fully loaded down roof box on top and bikes
 "words": So we have now had this car for a little over a year and i would honestly say that i have had nothing but problems | After two months of purchase we hit a stick in the middle of the road and ended up with a whole the size of a softball in the gas tank and that was not covered by warranty | We have had to purchase several gas caps costing 65 each and a new gas intake | I also have had water spraying out the vents with the air conditioner on | This should not happen when you buy a new car all we have done is put more money in to this car then its worth and to top it off its such a hard car to try and trade in for a better car the dealerships DON'T WANT IT | I will never purchase a Mazda AGAIN | 
 "words": Love Love this car and it has been over a year now that we are driving it | I needed a family of four type of car with room for more kid passengers or grandparents on trips | This car was it | I did not want a large minivan and needed better mileage for my long trips on highway to visit family | Some reviewers complained a little about the road noise I don't notice it at all | I previously owned a V6 pontiac grandAm and the Mazda 5 satisfies the need for pickup and speed | Drives great | The only thing I wish I did when I was getting the car was get one with a roof rack | It would be so useful on long family vacations | 
 "words": I have a newborn and before purchasing the Mazda 5 we had a mid-size sedan | It was a hassle to put the baby in and out of the car | We bought this car for the following reasons 1 | good gas millage 2 | comfortable for the baby 3 | design So far it has met our expectations | We are more than pleased with our purchase | 
 "words": It's been almost a year now since I bought the 5 | It is my daily commuter | I was told to drive it like a sports car and I do | Commonly doing 85 in the interstate | Love the size and ease in parking | Still don't see many around and it fits our family of four | Better gas mileage than our Honda Oddy | Only issue with the 5 was that I couldn't get the gas cap off | It was a recall | All is fixed | I would buy another | Recently took it on four hour vacation everything fit and mileage was great | Cant wait to see what the new one will look like | Most people don't know what it is | I like that | It stands out in a crowd | 
 "words": We bought this car as a family car just a few months ago and we could not be happier | We also looked around for sometime before we decided on the 5 | 
 "words": This is a great little van for small families | Handling is really smooth Zoom Zoom as they say | Very dependable | Lots of little nooks in the driver's side to stash cell phone sunglasses cosmetics | Easy to reach radio and temperature controls | Handy storage under middle bucket seats | Seats very easy to fold and slide where you need them to be | Ample storage when third row is folded down | But if you've got people in the third row forget about putting any luggage groceries or even school backpacks in the back | 
 "words": We looked at everything in this price classnew and used | CR-V RAV 4 Subaru Forester Kia RondoSuzuki Grand Vitara | Nothing offered the combination of fun and function like the Mazda | This is not meant as a replacement for the minivan from Honda Toyotaetc | You must drive this microvan before passing judgment on it | If you appreciate sharp steering and handling over a softer ride you will not be disappointed | Bottom line If you need to haul a small family around or just some stuff AND have fun doing it the Mazda 5 is for you | It was for us | For those complaining about snow traction | Get four snow tires | 205 50 17 all season tires were never meant for snow | 
 "words": Have had our vehicle for over a year | Power steering keeps cutting out brakes squeak like mad in the rain dealer seems unable to fix either problem | We drive 34000 km per year are a family of 5 with 3 smaller sized teens this is our only car | No where in the middle seats to put a drink down our vehicle does not have the under seat fold out holder which is annoying in itself | The back window never seems to stay clean no matter how often we wash it car washes seem to never get the whole back of the car | It is fun to drive and looks great gets excellent mileage BUT it is uncomfortable and the person in the back row is either hot or cold | Needs AWD for North American snow
 "words": Excellent Car | Have a family of 4 and needed the extra row in case we drove family and or friends | The kids love the sliding doors and the storage under the seats | My wife and I love the excellent gas mileage | It is easy to drive perfect for around town | Turns on a dime and has plenty of zoom | The other night I helped a friend move two couches no problem with the seats down | Interior space is surprisingly large | With the 3rd row seats up you have plenty of room for groceries | This car is perfect for a family watching their money | 
 "words": After owning for 4 months we hit a tire late at night on the freeway at about 70-75mph | There were about a half dozen other cars who hit the same tire | Only suffered minor damage to front end a little expensive to fix whereas the other cars required a tow to get home we drove off just fine | The rear seats can fir full-sized adults 6' 200lbs males for sort durations but are great for smaller adults and children | With the third row folded it takes most everyday challenges | LOVE the sliding doors and small size compared to other minivans | We can open the rear hatch with the garage door closed | Parking in a crowded parking lot is a blast you can even park 'against the grain' | Love IT | 
 "words": Hate it way too small cheaply made inside scuffs easily only 2 choices for exterior color if you don't want the too light cream interior-ugly gray and too hot black | The front passenger seat is so small it's claustrophobic useless trunk with 3rd row up 2nd row barely fits 2 small kids and their back packs | The worst vehicle I've had in 35 years of driving | My 13 year old van I got rid of for this car was far superior | AC is not intuitive | Car is too narrow to fit my soccer foldable chair in | I guess if you buy cheapyou get cheap | 
 "words": I can't think of another vehicle with this much functionality AND good gas mileage | You might get more room from a full size minivan but you also will only get 16-17 mpg in the city | I have received 23-25 mpg in the city and 28 highway | I bought this car used after I had a chance to rent one | The third row is small but is just fine for your kids | I have sat back there and wouldn't mind sitting there for around town outings | It's just nice to have the option to transport up to six people occasionally | I owned a 2002 Protege which was a litte unrefined regarding road noise | This is no Lexus but definitely is improved and more than satisfactory even on the highway | 
 "words": With two babies I love the fact that there are sliding doors | It's sleek design makes me feel like I am in a space shuttle | The fabric is easy to clean | I live in a small town with no highways so driving around I get 29-30 mpg | which is awesome | The price was decent too | Never thought that I would own a Mazda | went to buy a Nissan truck with my husband and saw this vehicle and fell in love | I am so happy that we bought it | Plus the Mazda version of AAA is really reliable | 
 "words": We looked at all vans but balked at the | Mazda hit it right with price and features | We have 2 teens and most of the time the 3rd seat is folded flat | Much usable space this way and easy to convert if hauling more kids around | Tough going in the snow the GT wheels look cool but the wide low profile tires are tough in the snow | As I told my wife they do plow here and we only had issue when everyone else did too so no biggie | Love the Bluetooth all the nooks and crannies and total flexibility in this good looking little mover | We also love how sporty it drives how well it parks and fits in the garage and the zesty copper paint | 
 "words": Well we have had our 2008 mazda5 sport for over 6 mos now and figured it was time to give our thoughts | First living in a snowy hilly area the winter handling and hill climbing power are both average at best | It lags at hill climbing especially at highway speeds | Fuel efficiency has been pretty good maybe even a little better than rated | The interior design is very accommodating comfortable | The rear seats are easy to fold unfold and the design of the controls is very intuitive | Cargo space with the third row up is minimal but with it down we can easily fit our two week groceries and more in the back | Reliability has been perfect so far | Black interior impossible to keep clean | 
 "words": We purchased the Mazda5 to replace an aging and not very fuel efficient Ford Freestar minivan | As we still needed a vehicle that could sit at least 6 people but we wanted something more economical the scope of our search was limited | After test driving the Ford TaurusX Rio Rondo and the Mazda5 and comparing the prices for each it was quickly obvious that the Mazda5 was the best choice | After 6 months of use we are thrilled with our choice | We've been getting 26 mpg in all around driving and 30 mpg on exclusively highway miles | The engine has plenty of pep and you can chirp the tires at a moments notice | 
 "words": Bought the car on Dec 31 2007 | 2008 Mazda 5 GT | Power is adequate | Acceleration is ok handling is superb great gas mileage | About 23-25 mpg in LA traffic but I did log 31 mpg going to San Francisco with 3 adults and 2 kids | Took me a long time to decide between the new CRV to the 5 but I sincerely believe that I made the right choice | 
 "words": Thought it would be a smaller alternative to a van bought it when gas was 4 | 00 | It is way too small can haul 6 people 4 with stuff but not both | Cons non-lighted mirrors small useless cubbies without lids industrial looking fabric door ajar light doesn't specify which door gas cap is very hard to get off wimpy horn can't close windows with car off small sunroof would switch volume with placement of radio change buttons don't change volume often but you always change stations add on off button cubbie under middle seat can't be accessed while driving sunshade is too short-useless light in truck have off on door armrest must be up to access back | 
 "words": I love this car | It has every feature you want | I didn't want an suv or mini- van | This car is perfect | It is so much fun to drive | I didn't like the style at first | The car grows on you | All my neighbors compliment the car every time I see them | It's great for a small family | My 2 and half year old loves having his own seat too | The only down fall is my stroller fits on an angle | Also the automatic car starter from Mazda is awesome | It worth every penny | 
 "words": We were looking for good gas mileage the right price with optional 6 passenger seating when we spotted a 2008 Mazda 5 | It is easy for the kids to open the sliding doors to get in and out | The second row seating is comfortable and has a great bin for toys and cups | Now I can pick up my friends kids or transport family when I need to | The Mazda 5 third row folds down so easily when not in use | I can't believe the ergonomic storage room | I bought a snow blower for my husband and there was no problem sliding it in the back of the car with room to spare | My 6'4 husband fits in the drivers seat but the glove box in the pass is tight | We are pleased with the overall performance of the 5 | 
 "words": Traded my Volvo 940 Wagon for the Mazda5 GT | Use primarily for business | I need cargo room and hate SUVs | First the gas mileage is awesome | 39 mpg on my recent road trip | Easy vehicle to work from | Sliding doors help | No mechanical issues noises squeaks or rattles | Really solid car | However I miss the comfort of my Volvo | The seat bottoms are too short and too narrow | The climate controls are way too complicated | The gas brake pedals are too close together | As others have noted the interior plastics are poor quality and scuff easily | Storage is sparse | Map pockets in the doors are preferred to the bottle holders | There is a storage pocket behind the driver's seat only | 
 "words": The Mazda5 has been one of the most fun cars I've owned | After finding out we were going to become a family of six rather than five we needed a vehicle that could hold us all and traded in our sedan | We already have a large minivan and I wanted something better on gas and a bit sportier so we bought the Grand Touring | The four kids fit fine though it is umbrella stroller only as there is almost no trunk space | Trips require use of the luggage rack with 5 people | I love the nimbleness in traffic and the tight turn base and size makes parking a breeze | It definitely has some zoom-zoom compared to other family vans | The 5 is fun to drive has nice features and I get about 26 mpg | 
 "words": My wife and I bought a Copper Red Touring model just two weeks ago after I spent almost a full year researching the 5 | We have two young boys and only occasionally need to carry extra passengers so this vehicle will be perfect for us | We leave the third-row seats folded flat and it provides more cargo area and more versatile use of that area than a typical sedan | I find the ride rather comfortable a little stiff on pavement seams but I think that's a deliberate trade-off Mazda made to achieve the sportier handling in line with its corporate image | And it does handle very nicely | This is our first Mazda so we're hoping it will be as reliable as the Hondas we've had | So far so good | 
 "words": We traded our Honda Pilot earlier this year for the Mazda5 | The Pilot is a great car but it's not the best if you're short 5'2 like me for getting children groceries and strollers in and out | The 5 is awesome | It has tons of room for a wagon or my bike plus room for the children | They can open the doors and get in themselves which is a blessing | And it's so much fun to drive | It's the best part of going to work | I haven't enjoyed a car this much since I had my beloved old Escort | 
 "words": I read a lot of reviews about this vehicle from different websites and after some test drives we bought this vehicle | I like the features but I totally dislike the stiff leather seats and the stiff ride | The road noise harshness and vibration are pronounced | We used to have an 05 Toyota Sienna and this is not even a mile close to the comfort of it | This vehicle does have its strengths too but riding comfort is not one of them | I tried the other trims later the sport and the touring with fabric seats for comparison and they ride way better than the GT with leather but still not even close though to the Sienna that I used to have | If I could just turn back the clock | 
 "words": Bought my Copper Red Mazda5 Touring in February | Traded a 2 door sports car | In early March I had a motorcycle accident and really messed up my foot | Have been on a walker ever since not for much longer hopefully | Anyway the 5 has been a Godsend | The sliding doors let me get in and out easily with my walker and all | And easily carried my wheelchair around and still had room to haul the groceries | Great utilitygood looks | I've had no problems to date | My fuel economy is not great 21ish but I still cannot think of another vehicle I would rather have | After I got mine my cousin fell in love with it and bought one | And my father is going to pick one up this weekend
 "words": Perfect for a small family | If you're worried it won't do for the family vacation don't fear | With the cash you save in purchase and fuel over a minivan you can rent a minivan if ever you need to | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle on a Monday and it was delivered to me on Wednesday September 10 2008 and it was worth the extra wait | The silver is in my opinion the best color for this vehicle | I am a confirmed Honda man | I only purchase Honda products just because that is what I've always done | All I have to say is this Honda better watch their 6 | This is a wonderful car 30 | 5 mpg mixed cty hwy | This car is better than a Honda | I've owned 5 so far and may dedicate all future purchases to Mazda | 
 "words": I am 6'3 tall and wanted to get better gas mileage than my Aztek but I didn't want to sacrifice a ton of leg room | My wife and I shopped for a RAV4 but the lack of leg room scared me away specifically around the knees | The Mazda 5 has good leg room and is comfortable | My children can easily open and close the sliding doors | With a new child on the way one of the two other children is already looking forward to the third row | With the third row folded down there is plenty of storage space | When people are in the third row there is very little room only enough for an umbrella stroller | This car is perfect for my daily commute | It is great for short jaunts or day trips | 
 "words": Test drove all existing minivans and finally chose Mazda 5 as a compromise between practicality of a grown up minivan and drivability of a sedan | Considering its price this is nearly perfect vehicle tiny outside but somehow very roomy inside must be some sci-fi trick unless it just a very thoughtful design | I also like the build quality and hope for a good reliability | And by the way why don't they put sliding doors on all cars | 
 "words": Tried the Mazda5 | LOVED it | Comfortable seating spacious interior ample cargo space great price peppy and fun to drive | Haven't encountered snow yet | thinking the manual overdrive will come in handy then | I highly recommend the Mazda5 to small families or anyone who wants an affordable cargo-worthy vehicle | 22 mpg in suburban driving conditions | 
 "words": Had to find a new car quickly and wanted good price economy and something that worked with two kids | Looked at numerous cars and the 5 | Surprised that it was hard to find but glad I did | Home town didn't have any and drove 60 miles to find the only Touring the dealer had | The white is really sharp | The 5 gets lots of stares and I think of it as a sport wagon rather than a mini van | I haven't seen another on the road in the few days we have owned it couldn't say that about the Taurus and Altima that I was considering | We made a GREAT purchase | The kids think its cool too | This will be my everyday car my wife drives a Honda Ody | 
 "words": This is the almost perfect family car | I studied every possibility for our family and couldn't find the right match | I finally discovered the 5 and realized quickly it was the one | Space quality price doors features design and MPG it has it all | It's a pleasure to drive this car | I must admit some jealousy as we found the 5 in Switzerland with dark tinted glass and a sporty luggage rack system | It looks even better | The seating possibilities are endless and easy to play with | 
 "words": I have a MPV and love it | Now I just got this Mazda 5 | It is also a good vehicle | I want to have another vehicle that can sit a family of 4 and cargo space for the trips to costco | This is a perfect vehicle and save gas | The price is about the same as Toyota Matrix but can sit more | 
 "words": I bought the Sport with M T | Vehicle meets all my needs lots of room decent fuel economy good price | The manual trans takes some getting used to | It has a very light engagement and is very easy to top a gear | I definitely will be tinting the rear windows to keep things cooler but the A C works great | With almost 3000 miles on it I am averaging about 22 mpg | Since all my driving is around town I find this acceptable but wished for more | Manual adjusting seats required me to get out of the car to raise the seat level | If you are willing to keep the RPMs up acceleration is good | Overall I am very pleased and hope time will prove me right | 
 "words": I needed a roomy vehicle to accommodate our new baby and all the stuff that comes along too as well as provide good gas mileage for commuting 60 miles per day for work | Seeing as a manual transmission is almost a requirement for me my choices were limited | I compared the Mazda5 to a few mid-size sedans and found that none could compare in terms of space or price | My wife who always swore she would never drive a minivan loves it so much that she now wants to learn how to drive a manual so that she can drive my car instead of her CR-V | Our baby loves it too The 5 is so fun to drive that I feel like I'm driving a sporty car not a Micro-Van great mix of fun and practicality | 
 "words": Traded down size wise from a Chrysler town and country also have Jeep Cherokee and Mazda miata | As far as size there is a noticeable difference | Some things also seem 'cheap' compared to the Chrysler | But we bought this car because of the price and gas mileage and sliding doors | Mostly for the gas mileage | Wish we could have found a galaxy grey with leather this late in the season | 
 "words": We've had this car about 8 months first 2008 out of the dealership and have been very satisfied with it | Gas mileage is about what was estimated actual- 22 city 30 highway which is good for a minivan | For a family of 4 each person gets their own seat with a huge trunk rear seats down with the option of ferrying a couple of friends around for short trips | For the price and value I don't know why I don't see more on the road although I see more in Canada | Only issue that I see so far is the front grille seems too low to the ground and I worry about hitting it on a concrete divider when parking in a public lot | 
 "words": When my daughter decided to go to college in-state we had enough funds to get her a new car for school | We decided the car should last her 10 years so tried to figure out the car that she would love now as well as 10 years from now | Looked at 2009 Matrix 2008 RAV-4 2008 CR-V | Choice was RAV-4 UNTIL she drove Mazda 5 | Fun to drive seat layout and cargo space won her over | The after-thought car became the obvious choice | She absolutely loves everything about it | About 2000 cheaper than the RAV-4 made me happy | She made a great choice |

 "words": I have been driving my Mazda 5 for about 3 months and couldn't be happier with it | I needed a larger car to accommodate my growing family baby 2 is on the way | The Mazda 5 is perfect for my needs | Even though it is very compact on the inside it is surprisingly roomy on the inside | It is easier to drive than a big clunky mini-van | I can even fit it in most compact parking spaces | In addition it can seat 6 although I wouldn't recommend this car for a family of 4 unless you're not in need of much trunk space | The trunk is plenty roomy enough to fit my jogging stroller and groceries with the third row seats down and the gas mileage is really good for a vehicle it's size | 
 "words": Traded in my BMW for a GT Mazda 5 | While I miss my beemer's overall performance I do like the GT it's practicality style gas economy | Best of all I can feed the GT 87 octane instead of 93 octane for the BMW |
