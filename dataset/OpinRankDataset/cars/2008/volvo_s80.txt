 "words": This updates comments from 2 years ago as the lease nears expiration | After 30K miles the suspension creaks and pops just as my 2000 model | Replacement parts by dealer never fixed the problem It's built in by design flaw | Gas mileage has improved to 21mpg mixed | and 27hwy | But my '04 Jag XJ8 is better 22 30 and much more fun to drive | Engine and transmission have been great but small problems mount up including warped brake rotors at 28K | Maintenance is relatively expensive but is included on 2009-10 leases | Overall a nice car | but at in this classover 40K I won't lease another and would not want to purchase for the long term | 
 "words":  I've looked over the internet an have reviewed many comparison among so call luxury sedans and the comments shared here and what I am finding is that most people really have not driven the new S-80 287hp AWDT6 | I have had mine now for 19 months | If you desire sport and comfort it's a excellent choice | However not many autos can compare to the ride the Lexus 350S in comfort but the Lexus lacks speed handling and power | It also is a front wheel drivecar | However the combination of power and torque will change your mind about the S-80 AWd T6 it will run with a 7 series BMW | Do you hear me | Two months ago I raced a 7 series and KEPT PACE UP TO 120MPH for 100 yds
 "words": I just purchased the 2008 3 | 2 S80 I have had it for 48 hours | I like the look of the car interior and exterior | The car comes up short with the handling | it has a floaty feel to it and I live in Europe and have driven Audi's Passats and Lancias | These car have great pick-up | this car does not | you learn a lot about a vehicle when taking a trip from Germany to Italy through the mountains at night | Overall I have to say it is a nice car but the suspension needs work | Turbo is necessary if you want to get that extra kick when you need it | Also some features should come standard with the car e | g | blue tooth front and rear warning detection for parking | 
 "words": Good year-end deal for current Volvo owner on '08 S70 w Sports Package | Smart style profile | Great alternative to BMW or Audi | A very comfortable roomy sedan with a sports car feel | Love rear visibility drop down rear headrests | Accessible controls | Many convenience features e | g | auto-folding rv mirros smart key heated cooled f r seats | Runs on regular gas | Would not have chosen low profile tires-expensive impacts turn radius and mileage | 
 "words": I leased the S80 at the end of Sept | I have noticed that the tires made an awful loud noise when driving moderate high speeds | The wind noise at 50 mph is unbelievably loud | I have been back to the dealer twice 3 tires were replaced because they were defective | The tire noise vibration is still there | the tires are Continental | My owners manual had tire info for 2 other brands | I guess Continentals are cheaper for Volvo | I am shocked by the poor ride from a supposedly good company | My VW Passat rode much nicer | I drive the same highways to work an hour each way so noise is very upsetting | I will try to go up the ladder for the tires I should have had | I was told the wind noise is norm
 "words": Needed AWD in New Hampshire mountains and the BMW Benz and Audi alternatives in this size class cannot touch the Volvo and I am a huge fan of BMW | Purchased the car this summer during the 4 gallon gas era and got a fantastic deal that the other brands could not touch | Nice quiet ride with adequate power not as well balanced as the BMW5 drives a little front heavy in some cornering | Bottom line is that I would still purchase this car should I move out of the snow belt given the price point | Interior exterior styling is excellent don't see too many others on the road so it has a nice unique look relative to Audi Volvo S60 4matics etc | which are everywhere | 
 "words": I never thought I would be the owner of a Volvo but fell in love with the safety features and torquey engines | Although critized I find the ride quite smooth and as pleasant as my wife's Mercedes | The car feels like it floats and such is not as engaging as BMW infiniti or alike | The car rides like a cruiser | The car has great passing power but feels a little slow off the line | The interior is all soft to touch and feels like reserved luxury | You can tell all controls were put in place with safety in mind | The Navi is placed on top of the dash and is operated via steering wheel controls to minimize driver distraction | All audio car settings can only be adjusted when the car is stopped | 
 "words": We also own an 04 XC 70 and I do not like driving it so I was pleasantly suprised by the S80 and the different feel it had in comparison | It has great styling and it is nice to drive | The interior is quiet and the sound system is good | The engine could use a little more go as we never test drove the 8 cyl or turbo but would recommend doing so | It is economical for gas why we chose the 6 cyl and love the AWD | 
 "words": My S80 is a well built car but after owning it a couple of weeks I'm extremely disappointed in how rough the ride is | I called the dealership to see if they had could order shocks that aren't as stiff but they tell me that none are available | Their recommendation was to decrease the tire pressure | not much of response if you ask me | Next time I'll be sure to test drive a car on something other than the dealer's recommended route | 
 "words": This car is a great value for mid 30's range | Its quality is second to none | This is my second Volvo and it is really a tight and great riding car
 "words": I am very impressed with this car | It's the most comfortable car I've ever driven most recent cars were Passat Murano | Very elegant simplistic interior eye-catching exterior and solid construction | My only complaint so far is the fuel consumption 20 mpg avg high for a V6
 "words": This is a competitive class and the S80 competes well with all around competence | Good handling top of the line safety excellent comfort and options that make the driving experience all the more pleasurable | The safety is key- compare the IIHS crash tests to the Mercedes E and BMW 5- and you'll be surprised that those companies charge over 50000 for a car that doesn't keep you safe | The 281HP S80 T6 has plenty of oomph and the handling while not in the BMW's league is a lot better than Volvo's previous sedans have been | Most will enjoy it just fine | The Dynaudio stereo upgrade is worth the money- 650 Watts of the most incredible car audio you'll ever hear | All in all- love it | 
 "words": This car feels and is solid | The drive is extremely smooth and the heating system both air and seats are excellent | The seats are luxurious stylish aand very comfortable and supportive | 
 "words": Great value for the money | Comfy ride decent power high safety ratings | A lease payment of under 400 on a 40K car was just impossible to pass up | 
 "words": Excellent vehicle for the price | With the rebates they are offering you just can't compare to the German and Japanese alternatives | With all the safety features very safe ride | All controls are very intuitive | 
 "words": This car is beautiful inside and out | Wonderful new design | Volvo did a great job staying true to their style but making it look way more current | My friends say it has sort of a BMW look to it | Plenty of power w the V6 | Nice ride both in the city and freeway | My only challenge is that it seems to have a rather noticeable hesitation when starting from a complete stop when accelerating slowly | 
 "words": The Volvo S80 might be the most comfortable and supportive car on the market | My wife has had a bad back all of her life and many surgeries | This car has seats designed by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists and it beats all of the luxury cars out their for comfort 3-level heated seats front and rear with power adjustments that make it perfect for any sized person | Combine that with whiplash protective seats the best safety features available and you have a comfortable car that if in a collision will also protect you | I do a lot of research when buying a car and this is the car for the issues I have identified | Combine the price build quality engineering comfort wow | 
 "words": Looked at the usual German British Japanese luxury brands and just when I was about to buy a Lexus decided to stop by a Volvo dealer | The S80 T6 seemed to have what I was looking for understated luxury solid build strong engine comfortable ride nice stereo and a reasonable price | A great value | 
 "words": I've leased 12 cars in 20 years including the original S80 1999 which did not prove to be very reliable | After examining Infiniti BMW and Audi I leased the 2008T6 | It is extemely comfortable and quiet | The engine performs on par with our Jaguar XJ8 | The transmission is smooth as is braking | Howevercompared to cars in this class there is a slight tradeoff in handling if driving agressively | and gas mileage could improve averaging 18 in mixed driving | The interior is elegant in its simpicity but the rear seat has been downsized | Unfortunately after 1500 miles I had to return to the dealer with an airbag fault which was quickly repaired faulty software | Overall very satisfied | 
 "words": This Volvo T6 S80 has to be the best car I've ever owned | It is the perfect balance of performance comfort safety and handling with decent fuel economy | I run it on regular unleaded gas and it's very fast | In fact I haven't floored the gas pedal yet | It's good off the line and when passing | That was not true of the MB E350 that I test drove | When compared to the E350 and BMW 530 it's as good a car for about 15000 less | Try one you'll buy it | 
 "words": I love this car | It drives great and eventhough I don't have one of the larger engines the car has plenty of pick up and go even on the German autobahns | I love it | Living in Europe we travel a great deal and already the S80 is proving to be a comfortable luxurious ride | Couple that with Volvo's safety record and this car provides the best of both worlds | 
 "words": The basic vehicle is fantastic but some of the goodies available make it really special | I especially like the adaptive cruise control | it takes a bit of getting used to but it's amazing on the highway slowing you down when you come up on slower traffic and speeding up to your set speed when its out of your way | The vented seats too are wonderful on hot trips and the ride adjustment is most helpful when you get into mountain roads | I have some reservations about the run flat Pirrellis but can't complain specifically yet | Plenty of power very comfortable and great to drive | I strongly recommend trying one |
