REVIEWS
 "words": I just totaled my car Sunday night and it held up very well I flipped it twice and none of the air bags went off im okay though | But I was very surprised at how well it held up with some of the thing I found out why the price was so low and they just kinda found the cheep way out | But I was very surprised | But I would never buy another Suzuki car 
 "words": Poor fuel milage for a car this size | Inherrant problems with tire wear and admitted problems with head gasket loosing coolantas pointed out by an authorized Suzuki service dept | 
 "words": Our Suzuki was totaled out after an older Ford Explored hit the driver side on March 19th of this year | None of the airbags deployed | I loved my car | I doubt I will ever buy another just for that fact | A co-worker has an 07 Forenza | was hit by a deer | twice within a a few months of each other | Practically the same spot on car and location within her community | and neither time did the airbags deploy | How can you trust a car that isn't protecting you | 
 "words": We bought this for my wife after looking at numerous cars and sitting behind the wheel she like this the best | She was happy with the styling performance and handling | No other manufactor could come near the price and the warranty is great | I have owned Suzukis' before and I'm very happy with their reliabilty | She wanted the sunfoof model but they were sold out | 
 "words": I have purchased a Suzuki product once before and was please with the quality and performance | I was looking for a car for my daughter and found the Forenza its quality and performance match that of the previous 1995 Esteem | Suzuki has one of the best car warranties around | 
 "words": Hey this is my first foreign car | I was drawn in to the show room for the price advertised | I traded in a 2004 pontiac sunfire | I can tell you after driving a mitsibishi at work american cars stink | This car is alot like the mitand I really like it | The gas milage is fine pleny of room in car and trunk rides smooth I have no problem at all with the acceleration | Not used to the zig zag on the stick but Im ok with it now | Great lights inside no way to lock yourself outlatch for gas capsoft interiorMP3 is greatstereo sounds awesomedid not like the 100 | 00 for matstight over bumps would have liked nicer rims power windows are super fast has the lock for window controlheated mirrors
 "words": I got hit by a person driving a Chev Tahoe on my passenger side and got pushed into the highway concrete barrier | I got some stiches cuts and bruises | Had to be cut out of car with the jaws of life | Interesting thing and concern was that none of the front airbags or seat side airbags deployed | 
 "words": I had a black metallic Forenza until someone ran a red light hitting me on the passenger side of my car causing me to become airborne and going under the wheel of an F 250 | All that and I walked away without any injuries | Plus the driver airbag did not deploy and i am still having questions about that | After all that I am still going to buy another Suzuki because my Forenza never put me down | 
 "words": The acceleration on this is terrible | The seats feel like you're sitting on a rock | The gas mileage is OK and that's being nice | I guess I just expected more out of this car considering I'm paying 455 a month for it and there's no cruise control | Even my 1993 Chevy S10 had cruise control | 
 "words": This car is economical with gas | It gets you to where you want to go in a relaxed way | I love it so much | 
 "words": I really can't say anything bad | One of the sharpest cars you can buy for the money | This car comes with great base model features and is much more solid than econo-cars before it | You don't buy these cars for sheer performance and gas prices should make the driver focus on doing his part not just the car | With the money you save invest in a 99 mod-chip for even better mpg hp | The mpg lives up to it's window-sticker quote which is more than a lot of cars can say | 
 "words": I have just the basic model of the Forenza but if you would just look at it you would not be able to tell | My car has chrome wheels on it and the rear spoiler | If you have a Forenza add the spoiler it will make your car look even better | I love my ForenzaLucy but having a car like mine you will get a lot of people who are hate on it | My car handles very well in heavy rain change out the wipers and get the new air dynamic ones they work way better than the ones that come on the car | Why go get a basic Toyota or Honda with crank down windows when you can get a Forenza for about the same price and get all power stuff | 
 "words": I thought this car would be good on gas and boy was I wrong | The dealership said it would get better the more I drive it but who wants to drive more than they have to with the price of gas as it is | I get about 325 to 360 miles per tankful which averages about 25 to 28 mpg | I have the standard and when it is in 5th gear it sounds like it is going to take off | I think there should be an overdrive or sixth gear | 
 "words": This car has been dependable since I got it of course it only had 6 miles and was new | I don't like the slow acceleration and rough handling on bumps | I think the car gets good speed once it is pushed and broken in | The gas does not justice I had way better usage in my V6 Pontiac Grand Prix then this little 4 cylinder | I wish I would of taken better looks into it and not have let the warranty win me over cause now I want another car so bad and I don't want this car | 
 "words": This is my second Suzuki car | I liked my '01 Esteem so much I thought I'd try another Suzuki | So far I have been very satisfied | I am a large person and this is the first car I have owned where I could not slide the seat all the way back | it was too far from the wheel to be comfortable | It has all the extras I was looking for has enough 'get-up-and-go' for my style of driving and the controls are laid out nicely | I do think I will spend a few bucks and get some nicer wheels | the steel wheels w hubcaps have got to go | 
 "words": The Forenza is the best value on the street | I have had two Civics and one Corolla and the Forenza tops them all | For what you pay for the Forenza you couldn't get a bone stock Civic | The Forenza comes with all power windows a really good stereo and a world class a c | Suzuki has come along way from jet skis and motorcycles | With America's best warranty 7years 100000 why wouldn't you go with the Forenza | 
 "words": The car performs well and is quite comfortable even for my 6'1 250 lb son behind the wheel | His girlfriend is 5'9 neither of them could fit well in my Sebring | Acceleration is impressive for such a small car and with the italian styling I've had people ask me what type of car I'm driving | With a 100k 7 year warranty I know I can drive this car for years without a worry | It's definitely worth consideration | 
 "words": I have been driving for more years than I would like to share | I have driven all types of cars and trucks and motorcycles | Owned a Geo Metro back in the 90s with a Suzuki engine | And have owned 2 Suzuki motorcycles all with excellent results | I just bought the car yesterday | My wife and I love it | We think it will meet our needs nicely | I am a big guy and I have plenty of room in this car | Nice interior comfortable looks great | This car is worth a look bigger interior than the Hondas and Toyotas Take a look and compare for yourself you will be plesantly surprised | When the after glow from the purchase wears off and when I have some miles on it I will let you know |
