 "words": It's too bad that Nissan could not tighten up the interior of this car | The car is enjoyable to drive gets decent mileage and is comfortable with minimal road noise | At 2500 miles I developed an interior rattle that comes and goes which is near impossible to have fixed since on two tries it did not rattle for service | It also takes forever to put the last 3 gallons in the gas tank but minor next to the rattle | Very annoying to listen to in a 30000 car so I'll put up with it for a couple of years and get rid of it |

 "words": I purchased a 2008 Maxima-SE withh Platinum Edition Package 3 months ago | It is the perfect combination of sport luxury | It feels sportier than the Toyota Camry and more refined than the Honda Accord | I chose the SE because I like the brushed aluminum accents versus the wood-tone accents in the SL | I like the way the car handles except it does have a larger turning radius than some other vehicles in this class | The Platinum Edition Package adds many great options | The heated steering wheel is great on cold mornings | Seats are comfortable | CVT keeps the ride smooth while accelerating | I even considered the Lincoln MKZ before deciding that the Maxima was the overall winner |
