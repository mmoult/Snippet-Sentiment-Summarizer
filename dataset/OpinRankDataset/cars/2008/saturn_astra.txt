 "words": I read all the reviews and researched the Astra religiously online and I ended up buying it without even test driving anything else | All the good reviews from this site alone really provoked me | Its a very solid feeling car and built very wellin Belgium I might ad with tight bonds all over the place | No rattles here at all | I got a 5 speed fully loaded every option avail including the sports handling package with 17's and 45 series tires | I have never been in a car that handles as well as this | Period | I see maybe 1 other Astra in a week where I live and I wonder why | At the price I got it for over 6500 off MSRP | I stole it off the lot | A premium European 5 door hatch at its finest | 
 "words": I grew up with Opels and I have owned a Cadillac Catera nee Opel Omega | My Saturn nee Opel Astra XR 5 door is unique understated and an awesome German hot hatch | From the wonderful smell of the cloth interior to the way the CDC40 Opera audio and board computer work to the sound of the turn signals this is pure Opel | I have the sport handling package with 18 wheels and the handling is Mini Cooper-like with incredible poise at 80 mph on the highway | The Astra is no fireball but I like the balance between excellent shift quality of the 4 speed automatic fuel economy and acceleration | A future collectible since the Astra will only be imported in 2008 and is discontinued | 
 "words": Every car has its cons and pros which is why it took me three months to decide between the Astra Mazda3 and a Civic | I'm glad I chose this vehicle | It's a great stiff drive that grips to the ground | Standard safety features give one less thing to worry about | The interior has nice qualities and the sound of the door closing is nicer by a lot than most | It's not perfect an aux jack would be nice and a six gear would be cool but they're not necessary | The one cup holder for the driver pushes me from not drinking while I drive | There's no armrest which I thought would bother me but having both hands on the wheel instead makes up for it | 
 "words": We looked at all the competitors in its class and the Astra by far was 1 in all the areas we looked at | Once I got in it and drove it I was totally hooked | The feel of the interior is like sitting in a Volvo | High quality in and out | Just close the doors and hear the solid thud | The shift of the 5 speed is solid and smooth | We have already put 3000 miles over the mountains in Phoenix and love the way it handles | The sun roof is a big plus | Don't get one without it |

 "words": Purchased a Salsa Red Astra XR w auto and stabilitrak and am loving it | The handling is sharp but not uncomfortable over broken pavement on my commute to work | The Saturn car buying experience also made it so easy to purchase | The interior is extremely pleasing with the data information center and high quality materials throughout | I considered buying a Mazda 3 as well but I felt the Astra's interior beat it while being just as fun to drive | The main improvements I would suggest would be a little more power and more storage inside | I would have never considered a Saturn before the Astra but I'm glad I gave it a chance | 
 "words": You cannot truly appreciate this car until you drive it | I had previously owned an 07 Pontiac Vibe and my lease was almost up | I was only going to the Saturn dealership to get ideas on what to buy next and fell in love with the Astra | My fiancee and I returned to the dealership hours later after going to look at the new Vibe for comparison not caring for the new model year upgrades on it | This is a fun car to drive | This car hugs the road and is super quiet inside even on rougher roads | I'm looking forward to warmer temperatures in Pittsburgh so I can use my oversized sunroof |

 "words": When shopping for a new car I was torn between the Mazda3 VW Rabbit Honda Fit and Scion xD | The Mazda3 and Rabbit were fun to drive but didn't get great mileage | The xD and Fit were not nearly as exciting to drive but get amazing mileage | The Astra fell in between the two categories as it was really fun to drive but also pretty good on gas | 28 | 5MPG on my first tank with 40 Very hilly City 60 Highway | The handling is superb it zips around corners with ease | I've been trying to press it to the limits but I have yet to get so much as a squeak out of the tires in turns | Finally a real European car | 
 "words": I've been in the compact car market for the past several years | During that time I was driving a GMC Crew Sierra | Every time the gas price rose I would go out and test the small cars Pontiac Vibe Ford Focus Toyota Prius and so on | I grew a real fondness for the Vibe | It was fun to drive and felt solid and reactive | The Astra is better | First time I drove one I knew this was the one | The price point and features | to me was a no brainer | I look for any reason to take the car out for a drive | The main complaint that most people seem to have is the lack of cup holders and storage | Maybe we need to learn some things from our European friends about conservatism | Fit Finish A
 "words": I have been driving the Astra for almost a week | I did my first fill-up today and found that I got 30 | 59 mpg | I do 64 miles round trip from home to work about 16 miles highway and rest stop and go | Very happy with the results | I have had a lot of positive comments on the looks of the Astra since it's purchase from co-workers and others | The handling of this car is just remarkable very quiet inside and love the extra large sunroof | 
 "words": I couldnt wait for this car to come out however I am disapointed | I looked at the foor door rides very well handles good plenty of pep | However I'm 6'0 and the front seat for me doesnt go back enough I can't extend my leg all the way on the gas pedal I would have to drive it with a crimped foot sorry not in Jersey traffic | If you get the car make sure it's for driving up to two people because when the front seats are all the way back they miss hitting the rear seats by inches | 
 "words": I just hit 500 miles on the odometer | Here is the biggest surprise 36 | 5 mpg on my second tank of gas | This was in town city driving | This car has much more pep than I expected 5 speed manual I have yet to down-shift going up a hill | It handles beautifully | The on-board computer with the upgraded stereo has more information and controls than I have ever seen on a car | The seats are comfortable and supportive No rattles and no buzzes | This car is solid | The upgraded stereo has concert hall sound | The turning radius is excellent great for parking too | It is still pretty unique on the street | You feel like you have a very exclusive car |

 "words": I'll start with the buying experience it was lets just say amazing | From the moment I saw my 5 door Astra I was absoluetly impressed | I mean this is one beautiful vehicle | And the drive is some of the best I've ever driven | This vehicle not only exceeds the price tag it demolishes it and the competition | 
 "words": First this is an economy car | it's why I traded my 6cyl crossover | On my 2nd tank of gas I got 29 | 82 mpg with about 75 highway driving | But I drive around the SF Bay area on freeways that move at 70 to 80 mph | With the needle just above 3000 rpm I'm running about 75 and the mpg indicator is above 30 mpg | The automatic shifts to neutral when you're at a dead stop to save gas and I quickly got used to it if you didn't know about it you might think there's a nano-second stumble when you apply the gas to go | After economy the seat on the 3dr XR is comfortable for my 5'11'' 285lbs | Tilt-telescope wheel makes a big difference | Finally a very fun to drive economy car that looks great | 
 "words": In a word FUN we go backpacking and this car is a perfect fit | The power had me scared at first because of the hills we drive but the 1 | 8 had no problems going up to Lake Arrowhead today but the best part was the handling | wow | This is not my grandmothers Saturn |

 "words": When I was selected to ride drive the Astra back in early October I was a little sceptical about how this car would be next to the lackluster Ion I was blown away | This car has all the looks and amenities of a car costing many thousands more the handling is also phenomonal compared to the Ion | I think Saturn has built a real winner and that they will be a serious contender in the small hatchback segment | 
 "words":  When Saturn decided to import the Astra the dollar euro relationship was more favorable | Come 2008 the car couldn't be sold profitably enough hence the lack of promotion and cancellation of the 2009 model | Generous incentives got me a great European car for the price of a smaller Hyundai | 11 years living in Europe enlightened my automotive outlook | Why couldn't Saturn have built this very car in Spring Hill | This car has a solidity on par with my Mercedes | Actual mileage exceeds EPA rating | Comfortable for my 6'2 280lb body | Great handling on a just finished run up PCH to Big Sur | Enjoying my 25 mile commute so much that I'm considering taking a job further from home |

 "words": The Astra is the second best selling car in Europe | Owner reviews on Edmunds and Yahoo are 95 favorable and gushing with favorable comments on this little gem | Yet GM and Saturn hardly advertise it | Makes you wonder why our USA-based automotive companies have a problem selling cars | This car will blow Corolla Civic and other imports out of the market if GM handles it right | Tweak it to get better mileage 28 36 add some engine options add overdrive add a auxiliary audio input port etc | and it will sell Build it and they will come | remember that GM | I am from Detroit and want our Detroit-based auto companies to succeed big time | Listen to the consumer and build the Astra |

 "words": I love this car | I'm 6'5 tall and the leg room and head room are by far the best I've seen in a vehicle | I actually have to stretch out my foot to shift | usually my knees are up under the steering wheel or straddling it and have to push in the clutch by pushing with my knee | The telescoping wheel helps too I can drive much more comfortably not having to lay the seat backso my head doesn't bounce against the roof this requires me to stretch my arms out to reach the wheel | But the headroom and telescoping wheel definitely gives me a more relaxing ride |
