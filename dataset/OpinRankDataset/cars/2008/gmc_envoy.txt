REVIEWS
 "words": I bought the Envoy as the most powerful 6 cylendar for towing | I turns out I get better milage with an 8 cylendar truck | The air shocks were constantly pumping up the fans for the climate control extremely loud there is no vent setting so it was either blowing hot or cold air wind noise was excessive the gas tank is configured such that it always spilled over when filling no matter what gas station I went to | Passing gear was great but taking of from stopped was very slow for a 280 hp engine | 
 "words": Not sure if I have the SLE or SLT | I rated the gas milage poor because it is extremely inconsistant | I travel 6 hrs interstate highway time per week and I go the same speed every time | Some trips I go through a little over a 1 4 and sometimes I go through a whole tank | Thats a huge difference | Also it should get better milage than a truck 17mpg just doesn't cut it for its size | I rated the interior design poorly also because there is only one cup holder back seats don't really fold down console is tiny and the computer system randomly turns on and off the change oil light | As far as build quality stuff I had to have the powertrain completely replaced when I first bought it | 
 "words": I love the power that the V8 offers in this size of an SUV | I would agree with some that turning is very soft with this vehicle but some like the smoothness that it gives you | I have yet to tow something with it but can't wait | Bose stereo is great and OnStar turn by turn is also great | With the pricing that they have for these vehicles right now there isn't a better deal | 
 "words": I find the Envoy Denali to be a very wonderful product from GM | I recently had a 04 Trailblazer and the Envoy has a better ride style and the Denali package is excellent | 
 "words": I traded in a 2007 Chevy Silverado crew cab that got 24 to 26 miles per gallon | My Envoy gets terrible gas mileage which is a bummer | Steering is hard to get used to my truck was much smoother | Envoy is quiet as was my truck | I guess if you want something that is quiet smooth and gets good mileage buy a Silverado crew cab | Costs less than the Envoy and has much more room inside | 
 "words": Never thought I would buy American let alone a GMC car | Drove the Envoy and it knocked my socks off | I'm hooked | OnStar is a winner and the car is fantastic | Only problem I understand it goes away next year | The Arcadia is the replacement and a car I would never buy | 
 "words": This is the second Envoy we bought | My wife is the primary driver | The last one we had was the 4 wheel drive SLT | Very pleased with the pricing and is an excellent family SUV | The 8 cylinder gives it more power and does not really effect the gas mileage | Much better than the 6 cylinder in our last one | 
 "words": I got the Nav Package | In contrast to another review I think it works great | Yes there is a learning curve but once you are proficient it works fine | Save for the XM traffic report it does not have | I have owned previous Nav systems with this feature and it is great | We get comments all the time on how wonderful the vehicle looks it looks like GM hit the mark on this vehicle | My wife drives is the primary driver and she absolutely loves this car over the Saturn ION we traded for it | Yes the gas mileage went down with the trade but the ride and the sense of feeling safe in a larger vehicle was worth the trade-off | 
 "words": I know I am not the norm I had my previous car for 12 years | Yes 12 years | I only had 106000 and cried like a baby when I sold it to a friend of mine | I have looked at the Envoy since 2004 and decided this was the year to buy it | Also the last year they are making them I love my Silver Mist color have had many a compliment when out driving | I have a sunroof and the nice stereo | I just put 1000 miles on it this weekend | I am kinda disapointed in the gas mileage but I guess it is to be expected with an SUV | I love the staightline 6 I have it has a lot of get-up-and-go | So in short love it | 
 "words": I drove just about everything I thought I could get off the lot in the low 20K's | Everything felt like plastic junk | When I got in the Envoy I knew it was the one I wanted | Felt like luxury but in my price range | So far so good | Some minor issues with rattling noises that need fixed but other than that I'm pretty happy with it | 
 "words": It rides very smooth | I enjoy the comfortable seats | I like all the extras | The wood grain center console and steering wheel are beautiful | I would like more storage available in the center console | I like that the vehicle uses 4 cylinders until it needs the full 8 | It helps with gas mileage | 
 "words": I previously owned other SUVs which road like trucks and were noisy on long rides | The Envoy has great power and better than the sticker fuel economy 18 average 20 or better on a trip | Seating is comfortable and OnStar works well | 
 "words": An excellent truck for the price | The Denali trim level looks great we get compliments all the time | Great looking interior we have the black leather with wood grain | 
 "words": Spent the extra money on a NAV system only to find out that to use the nav system a dvd has to be in your cd player anytime that you are using it | In other words FM or XM only while navigating | I have used many different portable navigation devices that are so much more user friendly than this one | It is all that I can do to figure this thing out my wife gave up after several very frusterating attempts | Save the money and buy a garmin | Also cup holders are a joke in this thing | The money I saved still outweighs these setbacks | GM blew away competitors prices | If I had to do over again I would buy the same vehicle without the navWe would miss the touch screen FM XM that comes with the nav | 
 "words": I love my Envoy but want to just say that I filled it up to full just two days ago and only put 120 miles on it and am already on a half tank | I just bought this SUV and I knew that the gas wasnt that great but at this rate I am going to be filling up probably every week just to get to work and back | If GMC came out with a hyrbid Envoy that would be awesome |
