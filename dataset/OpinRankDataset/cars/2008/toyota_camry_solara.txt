REVIEWS
 "words": Convertible is one that actually can comfortably hold 4 with my two active sons in the back seat | It has very nice ride especially on the highway | Navigation system could be improved to allow adjustments while moving | Voice recognition better than others used | Overall an enjoyable car to take out on ride especially on a nice sunny day with enough room for the family and all the junk in the trunk | 
 "words": This is my first non BMW car in 10 years | This is also my first Toyota ever | I am very surprised about the quality | Ride is a little noisy but it's a convertible | Other that that I love this car smooth ride and with the top down it is the most fun car I have ever owned | Fits a family of four comfortably I am lost without the nav | Besides normal maintenance have not had a problem since the day I rolled it off the lot and I drive 150 miles a day | 
 "words": I bought this car for a great price towards the end of February | It's not the top of the line model but it has the moonroof 6 disc and the alarm system | Yes there is some tranny lag and no I haven't yet taken it in for the re-flash as I don't think that it will affect it much anyway | I've found that the slow shifts do not occur when the shifter is in manual shift mode I'm having a blast shifting in manual through town and when merging | Gas MPG has improved 30 MPG combined with 4200 miles which is very acceptable being that my 05 XB gets 33 mpg | The Solara rides very smooth the front strut tie bar keeps the front end flat and the trunk is huge | Headlights are great cd display dim | 
 "words": I had reservations about buying a car I knew was no longer being manufactured | However there simply is not a convertible out there that provides the smoothness comfort feature set and room anywhere near this price point | And the close-out incentives were certainly compelling | This car is not about driving excitement | Freeway curves easily taken at 80 in my 3-series need to be adjusted down to 60 in the Solara | Acceleration is good but not dramatic | However everything about this car exudes refinement whisper-quiet Lexus grade engine solid thunk of the trunk smooth switch gear damped cup holder cover efficient top mechanism | 
 "words": The auto trans is very very slow to downshift in fact there is at least a 2-3 second lag when you push the accelerator to the power getting to the wheels | The motors revs then trans engages | Dealer loaded the new ECM software but it made little if any difference | Dealer said he did all he could and the trans is considered fixed and normal by Toyota | Sure shocks me if Toyota engineers consider this normal | If you get one be careful when pulling into traffic or when quick acceleration is necessary | The trans will scare you | I won't keep this Toyota for 150K miles as I did with the car I sold to get this 08 | Very disappointing | 
 "words": This is a very comfortable convertible and can actually hold two people in the back seat | The car has enough power for most situations | The trunk is great roomy for a convertible | Needs automatic seat adjustment larger rear window and a better navigation system | The navigation system will tell you to turn once you are past the turn | 
 "words": Disappointed that the new engine and trans needs a TSB update 0068-08 to fix poor shifting and acceleration | Disappointed that the radio display is very weak dim and unviewable with sunglasses | Disappointed that the brakes grab and are noisy | Disappointed with rattles and squeaks that have already cropped up | 
 "words": Car is for my wife | She wanted quiet comfortable sporty and spacious | Not an easy combination for a convrt under 30K | Tested Sebring V6 Mustang V6 VW Eos converts | Solara has best combination of space features and price | This was 4th and last car we drove | She knew she wanted it at only 30 seconds into the test drive | Pluses 1 | Top that does NOT fold down into fairly roomy trunk | You won't have to rearrange the contents of the trunk to put the top down | Ever | 2 | Practically no engine and wind noise 3 | Comfortable rear seating true but hard to believe 4 | Solid comfortable ride handling 5 | Excelent ergos and cockpit for driver front passenger 6 | Peppy engine No Minuses
 "words": We test drove 2 other converts | and the Solara was by far the most comfortable and by far the most quiet absolutely no wind noise | A wonderful car to drive with top up or down | My only disappointment was no back-up assist availableno power seats available on passenger side or 8cyl | up-grade | I would buy the same car again after driving it for one year | 
 "words": My retirement car after looking at many convertibles | Love the car with the top down but hate it with the top up because of the rattles in the back side windows especially the passenger side | On bumps or rough roads the window sounds like it is going to fall out of track | It started when I drove it off of the dealership lot and I was assured it would be fixed but after several attempts to fix it including shims being put in the back side window and a tear in the headliner while trying to fix it I have now been told by the dealership and Toyota Corp | that there is nothing that can be done that it is problem with this model | A 32000 car and nothing can be done | 
 "words": In white frost this is a real head turner it really is a Lexus 430 with a Toyota badge | The styling makes a statement this is one very striking car to drive | With the top down and the boot cover on it draws observers and great comments | The top does have a blind spot and the boot fills the trunk but I can live with those inconveniences | The interior is roomy all controls are of quality and this is clearly one very premium car | Performance is excellent the engine is quiet and the transmission is really seamless | Mileage is 25 MPG not bad for luxury | What a wonderful ride | 
 "words": Overall this car is a winner | It's fun to drive and very smooth like a Lexus | I bought this car because of its room and style | Fits four adults comfortably and also can fit three teens in the back need to cross-over the seat belts | I wish it had a little more pick up but hasn't been a problem | Wish the driver seat had a memory for at least one driver | Bluetooth for phone doesn't allow name of person calling to be programmed | Doesn't have the RDS radio display signal | 
 "words": I'm 55 yrs old and this is my first ever convertible | So much fun I don't know why it took me so long | I may have a park assist back up alarm added on to mine | There is somewhat of a blind spot | 
 "words": The test drive in the rain with the top up impressed me | The quietness and the solid confidence inspiring handling were very impressive | Love the gauge illumination at night too | The 6's performance seems fine to me and great gas mileage too | Car trip with only 200 miles on the odo got 30 mostly highway mpg at 70 | Top down on the highway is fine too- not too much wind and able to talk in a normal tone w o windscreen | The nav system is not as intuitive as my Garmin Nuvi but does have its pluses | Voice activation commands with the top down is iffy | Luckily this can be done manually | Radio is nice rear visibility is ok with mirrors and seat adjusted properly | Tilt tele wheel is great |

 "words": It has been an awesome car | From the day we picked it up the only time it went back to the dealership was for routine maintenance | Everything about the Solara is great | Comfort ease on the road handling braking it's all good | When you close the door it sounds solid | Toyota built one outstanding car | 
 "words": I wanted a convertible so badly and picked this one my first Toyota | It has the worst pickup of any car I have ever driven | My VW Beetle was more powerful than this car | I am hesitant when on a ramp to get on a highway because the car fails the get up and go you need | My lease is over in two years and I can't wait | On the positive side it is nice to drive with the top down on a nice day | Oh by the way the rear window is very poor in terms of visibility so be careful when backing up | 
 "words": Good car but the first one we got had a huge flaw in the mounting of the driver's side door which cause water to come into the car | Car was swapped for a duplicate model and we've been happy so far | Check the door for fit | Car drives very well but don't expect sporty speed or cornering it's not that kind of car | Interior is well designed except for crummy cupholders | Love the aux jack and its location | Multifunction display is actually useful | Roof operates well but the lack of independent control for the rear windows is odd and annoying | Roof quality is excellent but the blind spot is larger than my previous convertibles | Overall B to A-
 "words": I purchased the 2008 SLE V-6 just last week | I love it | After having a 4-Runner for 11 years I knew buying another Toyota would be the right move | I never dreamed it would be such an awesome car to drive | The ride is very smooth and stable | The safety features make me feel as safe as when I drove my SUV | The pick-up it has is great and the ride is just as comfortable on the highway as in the city | The trunk is huge | I love having a sporty car that is not tiny | Good job again Toyota
 "words": I purchased the 2008 Version 4 cylinder model I drove the 6 and the 4 and decided on the 4 because I didn't sense much of a difference | I seem to choose cars that end production the year I buy them | I had a great Celica | I am more than pleased with performance | Mileage stated on the sticker was 21 31 and so far after about 3000 miles I am getting 28 39 so I am very pleased with that | Rides very smoothly | No problems at highway speeds | Rear seats fold down so along with the roomy trunk there is plenty of storage room | 
 "words": Everything about the car is above average except 2 things | Pros 1 Quiet and comfortable ride | 2 Comfortably seats 4 passengers including the driver | 3 Hybrid between a luxry sedan and a convertible so you have best of both worlds | Cons 1 Navigation system was a bit disappointing | It does not speak the street names like the Garmin nuvi series | 2 Need more power as not very responsive when you hit the gas pedal | 3 Rear view limited when backing up | 
 "words": I did quite a bit of research and drove a number of convertibles before buying the Solara | All convertibles have blind spots | It is the nature of the car | I selected the Solara Sport convertible based on expected dependability as per Consumer Reports Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book | I am not a leather interior fan and I liked the look feel of the sport package fabric | The car has decent pick-up and provides acceptable MPG I am getting about 24 combined so far but I have less than 1000 miles on the car so I am hoping expecting some improvement |
