REVIEWS
 "words": This is a great SUV | My first small SUV as previously owned Dodge truck and Durangos | Bought new 18 months ago for V6 w tow package | I tow a 19' boat 3500 towed weight and all sorts of stuff in my cargo trailer | I have been very impressed with the towing | I don't miss my full size truck trailer is easier to load or the gas mileage | I included trailer brakes on the boat trailer and am glad I did as brakes are the only weak point of the RAV4 | Roomy reliable fun to drive and competent towing makes me very happy | 
 "words": I have always wanted one and when I got rid of my echo I decided to go ahead and buy a rav4 | I am 5'6 and I love it | The inside is roomy the radio does sound like its wheezing when the ipod is hooked up but oh well | I love this car and wouldn't trade it for anything | The lights in the trunk don't bother me and my seats do fold completely flat | 
 "words": This is my first Rav 4 | After a brutal northeast winter I had to get a reliable sturdy car and fell in love with the Rav 4 on first site | It's a lot of fun to drive and with all the bells and whistles I can't wait for winter | Even without the V-6 component the 2 | 4 liter engine still moves like a rocket | Loving the Ipod Jack and the bluetooth features from the steering wheel- awesome | 
 "words": Throughout 25000 miles in 1 year 24 mpg w V6 in a metro city is great while my 4-cyl '06 PT Cruiser gets less than 18 | The V6 and a comparable large rear window is the reason Toyota got my green | The turning radius surpasses my smaller Cruiser's | As you can tell my practical focus is on safety function and economy | My wife's preference is style and speed | With the Rav we get both | Researching options and reports Toyota seems to exceed American auto-makers for trouble-free longevity | My wife 5'3 and I 6'2 both ride in stable comfort whether driving or riding | Leg and cargo room are ample and head room abounds in front rear seats | Acceleration | Pray and fly with angelic speed | 
 "words": Lots of pluses for this little Toyota our first new car was a '71 Corolla now THAT was little | Traded in a 96 4Runner with the same engine and we're blown away by the performance difference | 4Runner wasn't a slouch but the RAV4 is a hottie | Even driving it hard on trips we're getting 26 | 5-28 | 5 mpg on the road which is dang good | best we ever got with the old truck was 18 | 5 | My wife likes the way the hood slopes down | says she can see more of the road up front | I'm 6'5 and although it isn't what I'd call roomy the RAV4 is adequately sized | we took a 9-hour road trip with 5 in the car 2 seater and all came back still speaking | A miracle | Never feels like a truck will blow us away | 
 "words": At 1 year old I still love my Rav 4 | The Barcelona red color is gorgeous | I would buy it again | My parents want one in 4WD for the mountains | Test drove the Mitsubishi Outlander but the Rav 4 blew it away in performance and quality | I ordered the bumper guard to protect the very deep rear bumper and the vinyl cargo tray | 
 "words": I love this SUV | I had a jeep and traded for this for fuel economy | I averaged over 26 mph on a 1000 mile trip | I don't like the excess engine noise when cold | Seats are hard but for a smaller person comfortable | Performance is better than Pontiac gt with 3 | 8 | Some wind noise but have a Lexus also and it's quiet | Great steering response in the mountains where I live | Corners not a problem | I got a lifetime drivetrain warranty from the dealer for free as long as he does the service | 
 "words": If you want to stay warm in winter while riding in the second or third row seat I suggest buying another vehicle | Other than that the RAV 4 is a great little car especially with the V6 | I've had the dealership tear the vehicle down looking for the reason why there is no heat coming from the ducts in the second and third row seats | Their final verdict verified by Toyota's engineers the system is functioning as designed | Since I live in Wisconsin going with a marginal heater is not an option | Toyota's suggestion trade it in for something that has heat but I take the loss on the vehicle about a 3-4K hit | Pretty rotten on Toyota's part but they know I have no choice | 
 "words": No surprises with the RAV4 | I dove into this purchase with extensive research and optioned it precisely to suit my family's needs well mostly my needs Limited V6 4wd leather JBL 3rd row tow package | On paper it's exactly what a family of 5 needs to motor about the local area with three kids in car seats in a bit of style | What this vehicle lacks unbeknownst to the spec-sheet analyst is any serious personality | It's fast but handles like a van | It's a suitable light-medium duty tow vehicle | I frequently tow a 2000 lb enclosed trailer and barely know it's there | The interior is laid out fine | Exteriorwise the front is nice but the back bumper is just plain ugly |

 "words": We bought this car in early October and have already hit 5000 very enjoyable miles | We've run from NYC to Boston and back twice one of those trips in the thick of the recent snowstorm | The AWD plowed through several inches of fresh snow the electronic AWD lock being a very useful feature when the plows haven't come through yet | Having a V6 gives added confidence and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this car | I'm 6'2 and quite comfortable up front | I have 4 kids under age 7 so the optional third row gets used at weekends | It's a little tight back there cargo space pretty much disappears with the third row up in use | When the kids are older we'll go for a Sienna | 
 "words": Purchased in Nov 2007 and simply love driving my new 2008 RAV4 | I'm amazed at how agile and fun this thing drives | It's like driving a peppy little sports car that sits high off the ground | The vehicle is well engineered and the traction control and 4wd provide impressive handling in the snow | The only downside I see to the vehicle is somewhat lower mileage than I had hoped for expected | I get around 23-24 mpg on mixed city highway driving | 
 "words": The car drives like a dream and is very comfortable | The V6 provides tons of zip very peppy | Bluetooth works very well | I like the side-opening rear gate | Test drove the car and it rode rough | I found the tires over-inflated lowering pressure fixed the problem | The car is quiet and handles better than our '05 Highlander | After 1000 mi | I'm quite happy with this car |

 "words": This is my first Toyota | It's been a little over one month | The first week I couldn't believe my eyes | I got 400 miles on the first tanks | WOW | 25 mpg for bumper to bumper traffic | And then it went downhill from there | I am now lucky to get 300 per tank or 19 mpg | Cold weather this week the back brakes are making a high pitched noise when stopping | 
 "words": I have owned the Rav4 for about 6 weeks and have almost 1800 miles | I have a 4WD limited 4cyl | It runs smooth and quiet | When it switches gears mine doesn't clink as a previous reviewer said | The 4cyl has more than enough oomph for basic driving | I'm not one for towing hauling so I didn't need the 6cyl | I like how the CD player reads MP3s | My previous car did not | I can get about 180 songs on a CD | However the random function seems to play about the same 25 songs | not sure why | All in all happy with my purchase | If I could go back I would still buy it again |

 "words": After trading in my Xterra I am very happy with my RAV4 Sport model | What impressed me was the tremendous acceleration of the V6 the safety features and the on demand 4WD system | No more locking in hubs or shifting into 4WD | It took a while getting use to the different configuration of the stick shift | There is good visibility out the front windshield due to the short angled hood | Road noise from the tires is apparent and is probably due to the brand of tires | The seats are not too comfortable on the Sport but these shortcomings are minor to me compared to my previous vehicle | The gas mileage is quite good although it needs more breakin to see more improvement | 
 "words": Been owning for about a month now and put about 800 miles on it | All I can say is nothing but good impression of everything that comes with it | Plenty of power to fool around on the road handling is just like a car gas consumption is impressive for a 3500 lbs crossover SUVgot average of 21 miles gal | Design of the interior is as good as sedan but too much plastic materials used | Toyota did a good job to fool your eyes you'll think it's a leatherette from a distance | This is the reason why I took 1 point off the interior design evaluation points | I love how the exterior look from the headlightsresembling BMW headlights to the curve line on the sides side mirrors but weird rear-end |

 "words": I just purchased a new RAV4 Limited and absolutely love it | The drive is very quiet the ride smooth and handling is great | I traded a Jeep Liberty and besides getting me out of my 300 ft driveway in 8 of snow I loved the turning radius | It would turn on a dime getting into parking spots | The RAV does too | One of the reasons I bought the RAV was for the gas mileage | Of course anything is better on gas than the Liberty | I also wanted a RAV because of the safety features | We've had 2 Toyotas in our family and would have literally driven them into the ground | they were built so well | I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a great SUV | 
 "words": I put in a lot of time and researched all the available makes and models both hybrid and gas that would satisfy my current needs | Based on the MPG reliability looks and price the RAV4 edged out the Honda CR-V | Now that I have had the car for several weeks I am thrilled that I decided on the RAV4 | The V6 is surprisingly powerful and quick for the MPG that you actually get | We are averaging 25 | 3 MPG so far | The sport model has larger rims and tires with fender well moldings that really make a difference in the overall look of the vehicle | The interior is very well thought out and convenient | As I drive around and look at the other new cars on the road I'm very pleased with my purchase |
