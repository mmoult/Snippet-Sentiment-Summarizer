REVIEWS
 "words": I have had this truck since January 08 | The power is deceiving | I hauled my 600 pound bike from Texas to Wyoming without ever feeling the weight | The truck just towed away | The little issues I have are the wiper cowel coming off for the 5th time shake in the steering wheel above 50mph rattle in the dash and a strange vibration that happens sporadically | Had all of these issues addressed at the dealer | They continue to irritate me | For such a great driving truck Ford should really adress these issues | It is my understanding that these are fixed for the new 2009 model | 
 "words": I bought the truck back in January and it has done well overall | Other than the the tailgate trim piece coming off on one end that was replaced under warranty it has held up well | The truck drives well and the fuel economy is what should be expected from it | 15 in the city 18 to 19 on the Hwy | The power of the 5 | 4 is there but it is geared low | It won't be the first one off the line but it will cruise comfortably at 80 no problem | Overall it has been good so far and i hope it will continue to do so | 
 "words": I bought this car June 30 2008 the last day of the month | If you buy on the last day they really deal so as to build the monthly sales figures | Bought an 08' Lariat Supercrew with every option except DVD | Was a manufacturer's vehicle w 4100 miles | Boy did they deal | Threw in everything except the kitchen sink and sold it below trade-in value | My ONLY complaint is the sluggishness when accelerating from a light and the gas mileage | My last truck was 12 years old I keep them for a while with a bigger engine and better gas mileage | I'll probably put straight pipes performance muffler and a cold air exchange on this one as I did with the last and watch the milaege improve | Great Truck | 
 "words": I had promised myself that I wouldn't buy another American made car truck | Capital Ford in Raleigh NC ran an ad at a price I couldn't pass up | After a rocky start on the price negotiations my salesman Martin Clark went above and beyond the call duty he got the owner of the company involved | The owner showed me the truck and the features and assigned his personal assistant to deal with me if I had any problems | I was told that never happens | I bought the truck with no test drives and have had no complaints | The folks at Capital Ford are as nice as they can be | From what I can tell they lost money on the deal even then they are as nice as they can be | 
 "words": I have owned my limited 60th edition now for almost a year | I do really enjoy the truck but have a few complaints | First is the clicking that comes from the steering column when letting go of the brake | Truck is super quiet and they put in something like this | I would not purchase another truck with this noise | Second is the 60th does not come with the simple windshield wash low warning indicator | Just does not have one | Good truck but I might consider the decision to go 60th again and stick to the regular edition | 
 "words": So far a great truck | Purchased when fuel was over 4dollars gal and when 09's were coming end what a deal | Chrome cruise automatic for 11K | Love the truck not a single problem |

 "words": After having exceptional luck with my first F150 98 4x4 that is still going strong as well as after test driving a Tundra Silverado and Dodge I decided to get another F150 | I went with a fully loaded every option minus sunroof 08 FX4 as I didn't see enough difference in 09 to warrant the extra for the 09 | I've read some reviews about poor power and I've always felt the F150 lacked the get up and go of the Chevy but I've been very surprised that this truck has loads of power and very nice throttle response | The interior black leather is really nice and the truck is super quiet | Very comfortable great power very solid | Other trucks were nice but I'm glad I got the FX4 |
