REVIEWS
 "words": I bought the S40 just as I was finishing college | it's a great car and I am very happy with it | I went from a Toyota 4Runnerwhich I LOVE | if I could have both I would and do not feel like I have lost much space | It looks and drives great and accelerates beautifully | Being 6'1 I need to put my chair relatively far back limiting the space behind my chair | Therefore if someone is sitting behind me there is very little space | That's my only issue | 
 "words": Mileage is ok | Sporty ride | Not much space for the rear passengers | Small and sturdy | Noisy at low speeds | Got a dark grey car and black interior | great design even for cloth seats | Intuitive dials and controls | Nice programmable features like Autolock rain sensing wipers tail fog light tow jack homelink etc | 
 "words": Haven't loved a car this much in many moons | Had a 2008 4 door Jeep Wrangler Sahara loaded | Fun in summer | Fun in winter | An uncomfortable disaster the rest of the year | Then | the Volvo S40 | WOW | Fun ALL THE TIME | and looks and performs beautifully | What a deal too | Was an untitled demo | Sticker 27K | Bought it at 23K and they paid off my Jeep | Why didn't I choose Volvo sooner | Safe | Stylish | Fast | 
 "words": Just finished one year with my S40 awd and I can say for the first time in a LONG time I really LOVE my car and feal I got a great deal as well | Loads of power fun to drive and very quiet | Probably even has a better sound system than I have at home | Best part though was that we did an OSD and picked up the car direct from the factory | Not only got exactly the car I wanted at a better price than here but got to spend 3 weeks driving it around Europe | If you are thinking about any Volvo you owe it to your self to look into OSD | Not all dealers push it as they get a fixed fee for handeling the sale but there are several Internet dealers out ther that can help you | 
 "words": The VOLVO S40 AWD Tubo is awesome | I enjoy every mile I have done so far | It drives well handles well and is a attractive looking car | I highly recommend the VOLVO S40 | It is a great driving experience | 
 "words": Growing up in the 1980's Volvos were known as the boxy yuppy-mobiles that your hip friend's parents drove | Nowadays the cars are still hip but they are far from boxy | The S40 is the perfect entry-level sports sedan for the post-college crowd | The car is very attractive but you can still tell the car is a vault under its skin | Huge door pillars and the comforting thud when the doors close tell you this is still one of the safest cars on the road | Materials inside are durable and attractive and the controls are very easy to read | There is some turbo-lag off the line but when yer cruising at 25 mph on the freeway on ramp and need to get to 75mph in a hurry | This car flies at mid-range |

 "words": I narrowed onto this model as the best dollar value to replace one of our cars | While it does not have neck snaping acceleration it is far from underpowered and it will snap your neck while cornering | Mileage on secondary roads is great city is real good and highway if fantastic | Little negatives no inside trunk relase or on the key fob and the doors do not automatically unlock when the key is removed |

 "words": Unless your family is morbidly obese the small foot-printed yet comfortable Volvo S40 is perfect the vehicle | The seats are best in any class and the rear leg room is adequate for people who didn't lose their legs | The driver foot well is a bit narrow thus an automatic transmission version is recommended | Although the model is 4 yrs old the face-lifted 2008 has finally done justice for the lines and shape of S40 | Its beauty and sophisticated design is up to par with other just released 2008 cars | An attractive Volvo what has our world come to | Anyway you buy Volvo for its comfortable road manner and silky smooth ride | BMW is no longer exclusive b c they are everywhere |

 "words": This is the first Volvo I have ever owned | People are often surprised when at 26 years old I tell them I purchased a Volvo that is until they see it | The Volvo name may carry the stigma of an old person's car but one look at the sleek design instantly extinguishes that thought | My black on black S40 turns heads and evokes positive reactions from family friends and co-workers | My expectations have been surpassed with this excellent vehicle | 
 "words": This is my first new car after graduating college | Before this I drove a 2002 E46 330i on occasion but my own car was a 1986 BMW 635CSi | As a BMW gearhead I never saw myself in a Volvo but the car represents an excellent value | There is a lot of performance I have 5-sp manual style comfort and feature content for the money | I have similar features as a BMW 328i for 10k less and I actually enjoy the unique style as a 3-series are a dime a dozen today | The ride is very smooth while still delivering road-hugging performance | As my first front-wheel-drive car I appreciate the all-weather abilities as well |
