REVIEWS
 "words":  it would be this vehicle | Bought it used but it only had 74 miles on it | Great Deal | Traded in my 2000 Ford Explorer w a V-8 | What a world of difference | This CUV is so much smoother refined and quiet | Love the handling and power | Took a long distance trip 1000 miles round trip and it was a perfect combination for passenger and cargo space | Three rows came in handy plenty of room for the kids | Minor quibbles CX-9s w navigation require separate i-pod module no automatic locks when rolling no rear back-up sensors Explorer had em no load leveling system seat cushion slightly short for taller drivers | Other than that having a tough time keeping it from my wife | 
 "words": Owner for 2 years | Overall very satisfied with this vehicle | Great acceleration and smooth ride | After driving it 1000 miles in 1 | 5 days I was surprised that my back didn't hurt | I am very pleased with this car's performance but can't say the same for the dealership's service | Love the Bluetooth and Nav system | Average hwy mileage at 75mph is 25 | In town mileage could be better | Loads of cargo room | Down fall is that no daytime running lights and if you turn headlights on during the day I can't see the speedometer very well even with my prescription sunglasses | 
 "words": Purchased my 2008 GT AWD in August of this year w 9k miles on it | It replaced our 2006 Chrysler TC Van | My wife absolutely loves the CX9 | I drive a 05 Audi A4 Quattro w sport pkge and I am amazed at how well the Mazda handles and drives for a larger heavier vehicle | If you need 3 rows of seats and don't have to have sliding doors then make sure you drive one of these before purchasing anything else | We test drove 10 different crossovers and SUV's and kept going back to the Mazda | I also drove the Touring model | The GT does not ride that much firmer for how much better it handles and looks | Love the sliding 2nd row for entry exit and the legroom | Ours is loaded and we love it | 
 "words": I did a lot of research before purchasing the 08 CX9 | Looked at Acura Lexus Volvo and Cadi | The X9 is by far the best | I can't believe there a not more of these on the road | I have never owned a Mazda before but if this continues to meet my standards I will buy another | Handling excellent | Style Awesome | Get up and go yes | I get a lot of looks with this car | I bought it for my wife but I want to drive it too | I traded in a Cadi SRX and this is much better | Great car you won't be disappointed | 
 "words": I purchased a new 2008 Mazda CX9 for my wife in Feb 2009 | We were impressed by the look and ride of the car | We were blown away by the fuel economy of our car | We were expecting less than 20 miles per gallon | We are getting 22 to 23 miles per gallon | Our only sore spots with the car are the hood latch that broke very easily and the third row seat belt hooks that feld off while driving around town | Due to the great car's ride and comfort those flaw are very minor in comparison | We will recommend and have recommend buying the CX9 to our friends and family | The power will blow you away | 
 "words": This luxury crossover needs to be taken more seriously | Perhaps with maybe a Lexus badge | The problem is it is designed so well that the big doors are effortless to open and close | But passengers think it's a truck door | and swing it open with brute force straining the door stops and slams the door when they leave | One of them even swung the door right into a shopping cart return cage when I deliberately parked there to avoid other cars opening their doors to it | People just don't realize this is a luxury level crossover | Fuel economy power and sporty handling is remarkable for something this heavy | I love the car | No complaints except my passengers | 
 "words": Excellent drivetrain fun in the snow with winter tires fun on pavement | This car does have Zoom Zoom especially for a 4500 pound wagon | Everything about the car is good except for the coolant leak that has presented odor in the car while in traffic especially with no visible signs elsewhere | The regional service mgr | refuses to step up and acknowledge fix the car with empty statements of 'protocol' Mazda almost has a winner with its flagship automobile | I really like driving the car just the annoyance is enough to steer towards another make next time | 
 "words": Bought this new a year ago | Driven it to California and back Dallas | Really enjoy the drive interior room fuel mileage nav system and performance | Engine performs nicely | Rear entertainment system is nice kids really like it | Powered rear door hatch is really handy | A C is powerful | 3rd row seats are split and easy to bring up and put down | This is our first Mazda and we're really impressed with this vehicle | I've hit speeds up to 85mph and the CX9 handled well | 
 "words": Having driven this vehicle for almost a year I have to say this is the most sporty comfortable stylish and roomy SUV I've owned | It has plenty of room for car seats and soccer equipment as well | It is like driving a luxury vehicle at a reasonable price | It is packed with features | The blind-spot monitoring is fantastic | Thought it would be a bother now its a must | It has plenty of power and can go 375 miles on one tank | 
 "words": I leased the car on a comparison review of the Highlanderthe Pilot and the CX- 9 | There are only 2 baby clips available in the 2nd seat | You can not put a baby seat in the middle it folds down | I put my 1st baby seat on the smallest section and then could not fold down the larger section to get into the 3rd seat | I needed to place 3 car seats in the car In the comparison they did point out the negative about the rear passenger doors being longer and more difficult to open it tight situations | I have found that it is more difficult in most situations | The road noise is terrible | There are multiple blind spots and the drivers seat is very uncomfortable
 "words": We have owned this 2008 car a loaded AWD GT for a month and a half but have only driven 1000 miles so far | We LOVE this car rides better than our 2004 Audi Allroad but there are a few missing elements that should be available on a car at this price | The interior is very nice in beige | Adjustable Xenon headlights are good | 
 "words": After test driving everything in the market including Lexus we decided on CX-9 | It is amazing how well it handles | quiet looks great easily tows my entire family and two more friends with room in back for golf clubs | The problem is the nav | not cheap but it's maps are 4-5 years out of date | Am told new DVD in fall 08 that we will have to pay for | ridiculous | Why didn't Mazda let us know | We would have waited | Bad experience with Mazda as I tried to get answers | 
 "words": I have had my CX-9 touring AWD for 1 month and look forward to driving it everyday | So far my only regret is not buying the grand touring for a few more dollars | The ride is great yet I still feel connected to the road | The factory tires are not the best for slick pavement or ice but seem better after having them siped | 
 "words": Looked a Lexus GX470 for months but did not want to pay high prices for DVD and navigation combo this car gave me both and a much lower price | Perfect size car for the wife to drive too | Love all the features | 
 "words": I am a Realtor and I drive a lot of miles for work to the tune of 25K-30K a year | I got rid of an 06 BMW M5 for my Mazda for practical reasons | I | ve had too many friends with the X5 that had many problems with a whole laundry list of stuff | I don | t care for the way the Acuras or Toyotas look | So for me it was between the VW Mazda CX-9 and Audi | The Mazda was in there because I have all car magazines coming to the house and I had read that the Mazda was truly something | And it looks incredible | So I went and drove them all and the Mazda was truly all by it | s self | The Audi and VW had quicker 0-60 times but the handling of the Mazda made you forget about its 4300lbs | the other did not | 
 "words": Purchased as 3rd car to go with a Porsche 911 | I've always driven nothing but European sports cars but am VERY impressed with this car | Steering is excellent for any vehicle | Handling is good for a car this big but Mazda really needs to address the torque steer under hard acceleration in FWD models | It isn't fast but quick enough for what it is | The interior is tasteful and well done | A few cheap plastic bits but what do you expect at this price | This car looks and performs like a 45K car and can be had nicely optioned for 35K | A steal at this price it drives as well as some competitors costing 20K more | Perfect as kid carrier or a sporty SUV- can do both well | 
 "words": I've been considering an SUV for quite some time but having driven sports cars and sports sedans all my life I wasn't quite happy with anything out there | When I finally got serious about looking last year I considered just about everything on the market from the Isuzu to the Lexus | I was surprised to find Mazda had an entry large enough for my needs and pleased to find the array of options and accessories to match up with almost any of the others | After a month and a half and 2500 miles I'm happier with my choice than when I first got it | I would recommend anyone looking for a mid to large size SUV look into this car | 
 "words": I compared Highlander Outlook Acadia Enclave Veracruz and the CX-9 | They all were very well designed spacious CUVs but the CX-9 was the only vehicle that was exciting to look at and fun to drive | I have had my CX-9 for 3 weeks and driven about 700 miles | The CX-9 is a very spacious practical vehicle and it is about as close to driving a sport sedan as a CUV can get | The Grand Touring 20 wheels do ride slighly stiffer than the 18 wheels on the Touring but I don't find it objectionable | The interior is quiet at cruise but you can still hear the engine growl under acceleration | Handling seems nimble for such a large vehicle | 
 "words": After driving 9 other 7 passenger SUV CUVs to replace our jeep after the birth of our twins the CX9 easily came out on top | It is remarkable how they make a vehicle of this size drive as small as it does | Mazda really thought this one through before putting it out there unlike most others that put the third row in as an after-thought | 
 "words": Following a less then satisfactory ownership of an 2006 RX-8 I made a mistake by purchasing a Mazda 2008 CX-9 | Although the car seems to be more mechanically sound then the RX-8 after 2 months it had a body seam rupture without any apparent cause | As for dependability of the 60 days I have owned the car it has been at the dealership for 12 of them | 
 "words": This purchase was for my wife | She was a minivan driver and I have always liked sport sedans | We were both ready to leave our minivan of seven years but with 3 growing children ages 5 to 12 we needed to maintain 3 rows and 7 passenger capability | Since we have owned 2 previous Mazdas I currently own the MZ3S we were very excited about the CX-9 | The CX-7 was nice but too small for our needs | This CX-9 fit our needs perfectly | Although a fairly large vehicle at about 200 long and almost 50000 lbs it drives like a sporty sedan on steroids | Acceleration is brisk and the ride is fairly smooth | The BSMS helps to minimize blind spots | Overall we are pleased with this vehicle | 
 "words": In deciding on a second car I did a lot of research over a 6 month period | To be honest Mazda never even entered the discussion initially until two months ago | Truth be told in test driving the Toyota Highlander Lexus RX 330 Honda Pilot and GMC Acadia the CX-9 had them all beat | The ride was incredible | Power when I needed it and agility when necessary are the atrributes that made the CX-9 stand above the rest in this category | While the review is true about the stiffness with the 20 wheels it's not as bad as the review potentially paints it | Interior and Exterior stylings are very very nice | This car makes people do double takes | Especially the Grand Touring model | 
 "words": I wish I had noticed how loud this car was before I purchased | Also the leather on the seats is not as nice as it could be | The AC seems to smell funny too and my new car smell left after only a week | I do love the keyless start | I consider it a safety feature because it keeps me from spending minutes in a dark parking lot searching for keys | I didn't get the nav | system but wanted a back-up cam so I had the rearview mirror cam installed and I love it | The car is growing on me | Love the cargo room when third row is folded down | 
 "words": Well after one week and 1000 miles including a 10 | 5 hour drive from San Diego we really like this car but there are some unique nuances | Car is extremely fun to drive and definitely has a good presence on the road | We have the all wheel drive version and driving in snowy conditions in Tahoe was not a problem at all very stable | Car is very comfortable good electronics and overall seems a decent value within the category | Nuances are though that the car does not have a fuel range computer and we have a grand touring with virtually every feature and does not have a compass or trip computer | Finally the iPod attachment does not work with Sat radio and Navigation big issue
 "words": I have been looking at buying an SUV off and on for five years but I was waiting to see one that would have everything I wanted and be a great deal at the same time | The reviews on this website helped me tremendously | I also looked at the VW Toureg Toyota Highlander Honda Pilot Lexus RX and found the perfect one with this | The third row folds flat really easily with the headrests on | Has every luxury and comfort items the others have plus some | 
 "words": The vehicle's design is superb | The driver's seat is the best you have all the buttons strategically located | Great bang for your bucks | 
 "words": This car has been a great deal for the money | Very happy with the details and the fun to drive factor | I have put 1200 miles on it already I drive a lot and no problems whatsoever | Small vibrations in the passenger chair could be due to my children putting their feet on the back | I don't know | But overall a great car | 
 "words": I've driven an SUV for the past 20 years | This car is unlike any of them | I traded in a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a car with better gas mileage and more space for my family | I spend more than 2 hours in my car commuting every day and I love my drive time in this car | It is a dream to drive | The seats are terrific firm and supportive | The interior is sharp and well done not cheap and plastic like many American made models I've driven | The third row seating is extremely easy to access and the amount of space to get in is more than any other car with a third row | I was skeptical about zoom zoom but this car made me a believer | Its handling and feel are unlike any SUV | It rocks | 
 "words": A lot of car for the money | We've been very happy with the car | 
 "words": I needed a true 7 seater CX-9 has a 3rd row seat that can actually seat full grown adults like myself I'm 5'11 with leg room | Since the second row of seating can be adjusted fore and aft 3rd row riders can get enough leg room without compromising legroom for the 2nd row of passengers | For those more inclined to enthusiast type of performance no other SUV in it's class comes close | The CX-9 never feels heavy or ungainly | 
 "words": The first word that comes to mind is fun | I mean most SUV' are fun to drive off road but rarely can you find 1 that handles so sporty on pavement | 
 "words": I chose this vehicle over the MDX Q7 Acadia Enclave and Highlander | This is my first SUV CUV | I love it | Excellent vehicle but there is always room for improvement | The suggested improvements below would put it way above its competitors
 "words": I drove different makes of SUVs for the past 10 years and this vehicle is the best of all | Fit and finish is perfect | Seats are comfortable and roomy interior materials are plush and instrumentations are well placed | Second row seat tracks are covered in order not to get anything pinched in there | hint hint | The transmission shifts smoothly and flawlessly | Acceleration is enhanced by the AWD without feeling grippy | The engine is quite and has plenty of power | The exterior looks sharp | Last but not least the Bose system rocks | 
 "words": After three months researching the CX9 came out on top for comfort zoom distinct styling and of course a non-boring ride | Looked at Lexus Nissan GMC even Volkswagen | Nothing compares it looks great gets attention lots of room feels much smaller yet solid road feel | Suspension does a great job feeling like it wants to be driven | After two weeks other cars had some pluses but the overall package has to work together | Congrats to Mazda for raising an eyebrow of all other manufacturers | They wish they had the chemistry the CX9 has | 
 "words": We looked at Pilot Highlander Volvo C-90 Lexus and others | CX-9 Grand Touring in my opinion blew them away | Only have 200 miles on it so there is still much to learn | It was immediately comfortable and familiar to drive | Very car-like zoom-zoom philosophy is very evident | It is easy and fun to drive and size is not apparent until it is time to park it or wash it | Dashboard at night for gadget-freaks is like piloting the space shuttle | Nav is to a large degree voice activated some dealers didn't seem to understand that | I currently own a 6 sp Acura CL- S and find every excuse I can to borrow my wife's CX-9 | Do yourself a favor test drive it | 
 "words": I looked at the Audi Q7 Subaru Tribeca Acura MDX Honda Pilot CX9 | The CX9 offered the most value and room compared to the others | My wife loved the look | I liked the Bluetooth phone features navigation system memory seats keyless entry start system and the list goes on | This is my first Mazda | After doing my research the CX9 offered an all around excellent package | It has the space for my family of 5 and is fun to drive | unlike my previous car Toyota Sienna | If you want a roomy fun to drive and aggressively designed SUV the Mazda CX9 is worth a test drive | 
 "words": We bought this car to replace a Honda Accord which we were sorry to see go but needed AWD | To cut a long story short we tried a number of cars we tried a number of 'smaller' crossovers including a CX-7 and then my wife sat in a CX-9 they had on the lot | 1 hour later we owned it | It was just head and shoulders over anything else we had looked at in terms of quality performance and out and out 'coolness' | Interior is stunning well thought out and comfortable | Leg room is generous as is room for cargo | Car is easy to drive and feels a lot smaller than it really is | While it won't break any records on the 1 4 mile it is plenty powerful enough for most situations | 
 "words": Much better looking than in the pictures | I got Sand on Black | Current car couldn't get three child seats across the back | Moreover with 7 month old wanted option to have adult in second row to administer bottle | Wife didn't want SUV I didn't want minivan perfect compromise | Whilst not quite BMW interior its probably up there with Passat top of the line with Passat pricing | Parked next to Q7 in city garage could barely distinguish the two side-by-side | 
 "words": The Mazda CX-9 is a much better vehicle than the 2007 Honda Pilot I traded in | There is less road noise better steering better stereo more power and torque | It seems like it should have cost more for all of the features how it handles and drives compared to the Pilot | The six-speed automatic does not downshift all the time like the Honda's five speed did and shifts perfectly unlike the GM six speeds in their new SUVs which I also looked at | Rear seat is easy to get into and seats are much better than the Pilot | 
 "words": Edmunds review is spot-on | I bought the GT AWD with Assistance Package nav the rear entertainment system and towing package | Interior storage up front and cup holders are a little lacking the rear doors open wide pro con and the wheels communicate a lot of road imperfections | That said I love my cx-9 | Fun to drive | interior feels very upscale | looks great inside and out | From the outside you'd never guess the interior space seats slide and layout is great | It is huge inside other than height though there is plenty of headroom | Got the towing package to use a cargo carrier for keeping trash barrels outside on trips to the dump this vehicle replaces my pickup | 
 "words": Compared this car with the 08 Highlander | We decided on the 08 Mazda CX-9 because of the standard safety features great quality interior and the very sturdy feel when driving | Plenty of room with standard 7 passenger seating standard 2nd row air vents as opposed to the Highlander's optional 7 passenger seating and optional 2nd row air vents | The Bose sound system is a plus | Great exterior design | My children loves the roomy space and the DVD Entertainment | We have discovered the zoom zoom zoom way of driving and what a feeling indeed | We recommend this vehicle to anyone shopping for the best of the best | Safety quality comfort the zoom zoom way | The price is just right
 "words": Like others I looked at the Toyota Highlander Acura MDX Lexus GX470 Saturn Outlook and Subaru Tribeca before selecting the CX-9 | The exterior styling is fantastic with the stylish lines and those 20 rims | The interior is well laid out and feels like it was designed by people that actually cared about what it would be like to ride in every day | Controls are intuitive which is a nice change from our BMW X5 and Infiniti FX | The Bose stereo also beats the Harmon-Kardon in the bimmer by miles | The bluetooth took 3 minutes to setup and worked with both mine and my wife's phones | Smooth to drive plenty of pep and comfortable | 
 "words": We are still under 1k miles so I haven't let loose on it however I can tell it is going to be fun once I do | 30-70 mph acceleration is fantastic | We shopped for months for the perfect car and we feel we got it with the CX-9 | Did we need the back up cam and navigation system | Not really but we really wanted the Blue and it was the only one available | There is plenty of room for us and our new baby | The only downside for me is that the seats are a bit narrow in the front however I am 6'4 290 lbs | This is the first vehicle I don't have to put the seat ALL the way back | 
 "words": I considered Audi Q7 Acura MDX 2008 Toyota Highlander GMC Acadia etc | but no one can come close to this vehicle in terms of performance quality and price | This car is 100 built in Japan and proves to be the best of the best available today | This car is a true head turner | After my research for three months I bought a 2008 black on black CX9 GT AWD with Bose and moonroof | Drive it once and you will realize what you have been missing | 
 "words": Car drives fast smooth with a calm fun to it | 
 "words": Bought this vehicle brand new from the dealership | The sales rep was extremely knowledgable about this vehicle | I added a remote starter all weather mats Lojack and rear cargo mat | The cargo cover cannot be installed due to remote closing gate | Mazda has done a superb job of putting this vehicle together extensive list of accessories and safety features are standard in this particular model | The car is riding very well only 200 miles so far | sound system is unbelievable | The steering response for a crossover suv is excellent | The engine noise and the cabin noise is barely noticeable | Acceleration with the 273 hp engine is more then adequate | So far no complaints | 
 "words": Picked it up last week | Waited specifically for the 08 and the 3 | 7 engine worth the wait for sure | Power really comes on strong now for passing | Perfect blend of utility and performance blast to drive | Comfort has been excellent so far no complaints from rear seat passengers plenty of room all around | Most of the upscale features one would expect for the money | Fit and finish exceptional | More quiet than the Infiniti we just turned back in from lease | Where we live there haven't been many running around on the roads yet which doesn't bother me at all who wants to see what you're driving on every corner | Adds a level of exclusivity | 
 "words": Bought my CX-9 this week | Did extensive search looking at the Acura MDX Toyota Highlander Volvo XC90 Honda Odyssey Honda Pilot Toyota Sienna | Reasons I picked the CX-9 1 Good access to third row | Second row seats can slide forward so you can access the third row without having to move a car seat | 2 Comparable to 2008 Accura MDX in features but costs a lot less MDX more difficult to get to the third row and dash is very cluttered with different knobs | 3 Comparable to the 2008 Highlander but a better ride | Highlander still has a trucky feel | 4 Decided against the minivans because the new cross-over SUVs offer comparable features and space without the minivan ride | 
 "words": I have been shopping for family car for a long time | I test drove many cars such as Honda Pilot Odyessy Toyota Highlander Toyota Sienna GMC Acadia and Hyundai Veracruz | I was going to get Honda Odyessy since it is very affordable and looks good but I did not like how it drove | However after I drove Mazda CX9 it was love at first sight | I love how it drives | Exterior and interior looks great | They did great design overall | Ride is firm and roomy for 7 adults | 
 "words": I test drive the Saturn Outlook the new 2008 Highlander Honda Pilot and the 2007 Acura MDX | The CX-9 was more fun to drive than all of them and still gave me a real third row seat | I took my 22 year old son with me and we both tried getting in and out of the back seats in all of them and the Mazda was the easiest | I found this the ideal car for taking my road bike to the club starting point and hauling 7 family members to dinner and the most fun to drive of all the cars | Economy seems the same as my 1997 Camry V6 so far on the first two tanks | 
 "words": Bought this to replace our '01 Honda CRV | Researched many third row SUVS | Came down to a Yukon or the CX9 | My wife liked the CX9 because the ride was so much smoother | Couldn't agree more for once | The CX9 is a great SUV roomy and well designed interior and sleek exterior | First time Mazda buyer and will definitely consider Mazda the next time | 
 "words": I picked up a new top of the line 2008 Mazda CX9 Grand Touring for my wife in January of 2009 | This car is amazing comparing to other SUV | s like the Ford Edge Nissan Murano and the Lincoln MKX the CX-9 was the best choice for the money | The CX-9 is Sporty stylish and roomy loads of cargo space easy access to spacious third row even for an average-sized adult The two- passenger third-row seat is one of the roomiest you'll find | And the second row seats are very comfortable for adults | The CX-9 an attractive dash design and an adequate number of technoland an adequate number of technology and entertainment features too many to mentioned | got an excellent deal | Couldn't be happier
 "words": Just bought the vehicle and immediately took it on a LONG trip | A pretty comfortable ride with lots of room | Some very nice features and received lots of compliments on the exterior design | Overall we are pleased | Not all is perfect in Zoom Zoom land however | With a load it takes its sweet time passing cars at freeway speeds | Husband sez something about low-end torque | or lack thereof | Mileage about as expected | maybe 22 on open road | Surprisingly not much worse in town | Having to pay extra for satellite radio installation in a vehicle of this price range is disappointing | Radar in rear bumper that detects passing vehicles and sometimes nearby guard rails is a great safety feature | 
 "words": Have owned our CX-9 for 4 months | Previously had a Honda Pilot which we liked | The CX-9 is just fun to drive | Great handling | Lots of room great features | First Mazda we have owned and we really like it | 
 "words": Mazda CX-9 replaced a Volvo XC-90 in September 2008 | We have been very pleased especially with the V6 performance note 2008 is larger engine than 2007 and comfortable yet sporty ride even with 19 wheels | Nav is very good | Bose stereo is pretty good but not as good as some other high-end factory audio systems | All weather mats from the factory sit flat on the ground and don't really catch the snow and water very well | Volvo is the king of seat design and it is too bad that Ford didn't steal more of this technology to give to Mazda | Gas mileage is reasonable for a truck this size | Tons of room | 
 "words":  Cx9 best value for the cost | very good in snow here in Colorado | very responsive handling | Driver position very comfortable | Xenon head lights useful on mountain roads at night | Third row seat and storage area a big benefit along with sun-roof and side warning system | Excellent sound system and navigation | best value for the price in this category | 
 "words": Was completely impressed with the Cx9 | After searching for six months we narrowed it down to the Volvo XC90 and the CX9 | We chose the CX9 because of the available technology comfort and style | 
 "words": Cons so-so fuel economy 16-17 mixed driving with AWD few customizing accessories Pros everything else 
 "words": We are absolutely thrilled with our GT CX 9 | We compared to several others Lexus Acura Toyota Honda ect and this is by far the best value for the money | The Navigation Bluetooth are easy to use | The interior finishes are classy and comfortable | All in all a real headturner | It is our first Mazda and definitely would purchase all over again | Best car I've ever owned -from a former Lexus Honda and Toyota owner | I am converted to Mazda s | Fun to drive and a smooth ride | 
 "words": I'm loving it | I had an CX-7 and the turbo was too much for me to handle turbo lag was omnipresent | I was dreaming about CX-9 since I bought CX- 7 but my wife was not so sure we can handle 40K | Then I missed more all the options that my Grand Touring Buick LeSabre 2000 was having rain sensing wipers day lights compass in the rearview mirror trip computer and so on | Missed so much the Buick | and I ended up trading in CX-7 for CX-9 | In the first day I drove in Greater Chicagoland area 200 miles of fun and joy | I was so happy that I could not believe it | Thank You Mazda for being number one in my heart | Still | put the towing package for GT | Please | 
 "words": This is our first Mazda | It is a new 2008 and has slightly less than 1000 miles | So far we are very pleased with the performance | We are getting about 17 | 2 mpg with City highway driving | The third seat is great for the grandchildren | As you would anticipate for a big car the acceleration is a bit sluggish and the fuel mileage is nothing to brag about | The CX-9 qualifies as a luxury vehicle | 
 "words": I chose among Highlander Pilot and CX9 | Pilot is too ugly for my taste | Highlander is too expensive with ultra-cheap 3rd row and non-splittable | CX9 is the best deal out there | I was worrying about the reliability like most potential buyers would be | No problem for me after 1 year | Mazda service in my area is also superb | Loaners for repairs TSB etc | and major services | The bottom like is that CX9 drives like a BMW X5 with more than 20K saved in your bank | 
 "words": This is our second Mazda having driven a 2008 CX-7 since early 2008 which was a company car | We were so impressed with it that we decided to buy the CX-9 for it's greater seating and because of excellent consumer reviews to accompany our experience with the CX-7 | We couldn't be happier with our purchase | We bought a program car with 18K miles on it for about 21K with leather seats | Another 600 spent on a DVD player and 200 on GPS saved us about 2-3K for the factory installed versions | We couldn't be more pleased with this vehicle | The ride and comfort is better than the CX-7 | it's quieter and feels very luxurious | We'll have this for a long time | 
 "words": This vehicle is amazing | As a car nut who has owned just about every type of car imaginable including Audi BMW etc | this vehicle has exceeded my expectations in every way | The drivability and sheer practicality of the CX-9 is unmatched | I looked at every crossover and for anyone who enjoys cars there simply is no comparison if you need the room of a 3 row CUV SUV | I even owned the new Acura MDX and aside from the Acura's vastly superior navigation system just about everything else on the CX-9 is better | BTW I have not had any issues with the 20 inch wheels the ride is smooth taut and in no way harsh | The CX-9 simply drives like a nice European vehicle | Highly recommend it | 
 "words": I wanted to wait until I had 150000 miles before I wrote this review | I am 55 and buy a new car about every 3 maybe 4 years and have since I was 20 | I have always had station wagon mini van SUV type vehicles | Owned mainly GM and Ford and I can say without doubt that the CX9 GT is the best vehicle I have bought | It handles beautifully is so quiet and smooth | No problems of any kind in my first 15K miles | We have taken in the mountains of CO and gone on dirt mt | roads and the FWD was superior to any of my RWD vehicles | This is a roomy fun car to drive and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone | I drove the GMC Acadia and its a nice car but not near as nice as the CX9 GT |
