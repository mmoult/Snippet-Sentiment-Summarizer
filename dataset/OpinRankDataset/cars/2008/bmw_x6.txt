REVIEWS
 "words": We test drove the 3 | 5 and loved the styling | The car handled and had acceptable acceleration but felt heavy | When looking at the weight I knew that having the 5 | 0 engine would make all the difference in the world | Well when I went down to test drive it | words can | t describe it | Many people say | I don | t get it | I can tell you get behind the wheel and you | Will Get It | I know it | s not for everyone and honestly that was a whole level beyond why I wanted it | In the three months I | ve had it I | ve only seen 3 on the road | I can | t count the FX ML | s RX | s and Cayenne | s | There is a sense of exclusivity that comes with owning one | If you don | t like attention don | t by an X6 | 
 "words": Got every available option on my X6 and I am loving it | Don't confuse this car with an SUV | it is a Sports Activity Coupe with room for any foursome golf tennis skiing or datingand all the accompanying equipment clubs rackets skis and luggage | My grandson can even watch movies in the back seat | Just got mine back from BMW Collision after rear ending a Cadillac sedan | Awesome collision safety behavior from the car with only frontal damage while the Cadillac regretfully was demolished | The repair by BMW looks amazing | 
 "words": Having owned the Range Rover Supersport supercharged and Audi q7 I can say that this car exceeds all of these on every front for driving pleasure and fun without giving ground except for serious off roading | The twin turbo is very responsive and returns good mileage | Handling is incredible for a car of this type | Space is very good at 6'4 no problem in finding a very comfortable seating position even the back seats are good for a 6' person | Overall very solid just what you expect | 
 "words": A great look and glad we bought instead of Infiniti FX35 which is likely a good car | Outside lines turn heads interior is comfortable | Can go to the snow | Hwy mileage is 22 around town is low 15 | Very fast for 6 cyl | Very solid | We own 06 Denali so don't expect it to tow haul huge loads etc | We are new empty nesters and this car fits our needs very well and better for us than X 5 | Rear view has not been a problem for us | took couple in back seats and they said they were comfortable | Great car | 
 "words": Sure it gets attention but I wish more attention had been given to practical design | It's nearly impossible to see out of the rear window making reverse a dangerous exercise | The rear view camera display states to never rely solely on camera when that's exactly what the driver must do | Side vision is also hampered by the steep drop off of the front fenders the driver can't tell see the outboard edge of the car | The liftgate has two opening heights but getting past the low one is fiddly at best making loading anything back there a long reach into a shallow slit opening | Super- expensive tires | People will look at you alright but I'd rather the car be more user friendly | 
 "words": This is my 3rd BMW but my first new BMW and will not be my last | I have never been in a vehicle that has turned more heads and make even other luxury car owners smile and give me the Big Thumbs Up | The Interior is nice and roomy the controls are logically laid out and the car is just a dream to drive | 
 "words": Gotta say I was thinking of an AWD vehicle after living in Illinois and having a 550i that was fun to drive in the summer but in Chicago winters a bear to control | I was in the market for AWD w o the boxy look | I walked into the showroom and they were unloading it from the semi-trailer | I fell in love with the shape and the wide stance | I can also say it chews up the curves and has been a definite attention getter | To becoming almost an annoyance | I feel like a rock star when I'm behind the wheel | The ride height is perfect and the handling is superb | Needs a little more pep in the 6 cylinder | 
 "words": BMW's first SUV that drives like a sports car | Despite the sacrifice of the utility aspect the SAV is a heavy well build automobile with sufficient twin turbo engine and impressive handling performance and spacious comfort for four | There are numerous high-tech gadgets and functions in the car to entertain you and make you feel real good | The drawbacks no utility no space gas-guzzler even for the V6 pricey when equipped fully the navigation dvd processor is too noisy and finally the design attracts too much attention | If you can afford one go for it | I'm enjoying mine | 
 "words": I was in error when I submitted my original review | The X6 does have the TPM standard I just was not used to the IDrive and the TPM function is greyed out not accessible when the car is off | I was playing with all the settings without the car running so that's why it did not show up | I did have a computer glitch warning me that the AWD and DSC DBS and startoff assist had malfunctioned | Problem was a 20 brake relay swith that was sending a wrong signal | Dealership fixed it and everthing has been fine since | Still love the car and a definite head turner | 
 "words": I have had 3 X5s and used to drive sports cars prior to that | As much as I loved the X5 I still missed the coupe look and feel | And then the X6 came along | Exactly what I wanted | I still cannot wipe that smile off my face every time I look at it or get behind the wheel | What a car the engine is fantastic the handling superb and I just can't rave enough about the outside look | I have not been this excited about a car since my 1993 Acura Legend coupe with 6 speed manual transmission | I ordered mine to have exactly what I wanted and the 3 weeks it took before I got the car seemed like and eternity | 
 "words": Very happy with the X6 after almost 2 months | I love the handling with the sport package | much improved over my 2007 X5 4 | 4i | No reliability problems yet | Definitely a head turner and I enjoy the convenience of an SUV without the boxy SUV reputation | The turbo six performs as well as the V-8 in the 4 | 8i X5 but gets significantly better gas mileage | I didn't want to wait a few months for availability of the turbo V-8 but at current gas prices the turbo six is an adequate choice | You just have to push it a little harder | 
 "words": I just trade in the 2006 530Xi wagon love this vehicle fun to drive have the SUV high command feeling but with good road performance | Now I hate my 07 Escalade | 
 "words": I have an X5 and quite happy with it | I took a test drive of X6-35i and was very impressed with its handling of curves uphill pickup and the interior | It is a pricy toy | Question is less room than X5 but more fun |
