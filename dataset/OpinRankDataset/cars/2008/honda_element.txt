REVIEWS
 "words": This is my last Honda | For the last 25 years I have bought them all Toyota Nissan Ford Subaru Caddy | etc but never witnessed a vehicle in this size to only tow 600 pounds | This means weak Transmission and lack of suspension support | They sure made it big enough to stuff whole garage full of stuff | Plus the sheet sounds like it was make of coke cans | The car is noisy and can't decide to stay in 4th or 5th gear | From what I know all Hondas have this problem | WEAK and noisy | AWD system does not do so well compared to my Suby | The front wheel always slips during rain or snow and engages the rear tad late | what's the point | Prone to roll over | Complete design flaw
 "words": I bought my Element used with 21000 miles on it and have since put 7000 miles on it with only great news to report | My Element has given me a reliable and fun driving experience from day one | I've used the Element to go camping and haul all my equipment to evenings at the Drive-In theater | The AWD makes driving in the rain a breeze and I love love love the ride height of the Element | The water resistant seats and flooring have worked out nicely for my trips down to the beach with my 90lb dog | I enjoy my Element more and more every day and I can't wait for snow season to take the Element to the slopes for some snowboarding | 
 "words": My 2008 Element EX AWD with 5 spd manual does all I need it to | I replaced a '04 Jetta because I wanted 4WD for the winter road conditions and I needed space to haul stuff- but did not want a pickup truck | The Element along with a lightweight aluminum trailer when needed satisfies all needs | Upon delivery from dealer I noticed a leak of clear fluid on my garage floor | turns out it was from the rear differential and they promptly replaced it and I've had no problems since | Feels stable in slippery conditions and has good power | I've consistently averaged 25 mpg summer 22 in winter | Smoothest manual transmission I've ever driven | 
 "words": This is my second Element | My first one was a 2006 same equipment different color and traded for an S2000 which was fun while it lasted | I use my 2008 Element as a daily driver and I also sell a high-end Swedish car in my day job which I know inside and out this will explain some of my suggestions later on | I think the Element is the perfect vehicle for me for a lot of reasons | It gets reasonable gas mileage 27 highway 24 overall it has reasonable power is a blast to drive no S2000 but what is | is reliable as motor vehicles get and has great ergonomics and fun to drive | 
 "words": If we had purchased any other vehicle we'd have ruined the interior by now | As an active young military couple we are avid beach-goers dog lovers and spend lots of time traveling 13-15 hrs to see family when we get leave time | This vehicle is perfect for it all | We easily fit our two English mastiffs in the back with room to spare | The waterproof interior holds up great against all the sand ocean water and drool | It's comfortable to ride in for all of our long trips and it's been great for driving to and from dog shows | We've actually had the discussion about what will happen if Honda stops making the Element by the time we want another one and we don't know what we'll do | 
 "words": So many want to be SUV's don't hold a candle to the Element | With urethane floors water stain proof seats huge storage capabilities AWD and good low end torque this vehicle runs circles around the competition | There really is nothing like it | If you bike we can get two road bikes with aero bars in the BACK camp scuba dive just toss your gear in and hose out later this is the winner hands down | Most SUV's are all image but no substance carpet and leather seats are not advantageous to an active lifestyle | The Element delivers with Honda reliability | After years of Jeeps and their mechanical issues I am hooked on this Honda's sewing machine perfect and simple four cylinder | 
 "words": This replaces my 04 Element LX and it is leaps and bounds better | The AWD was great in a hard great lakes winter even with the OEM tires | The colored body panels are a definite looks upgrade | The stereo in the EX sounds great and the steering wheel audio controls are something I wouldn't go without again | Fuel mileage is so-so and wind noise can be excessive on the highway | Overall I love this car for the functionality and great winter handling | 
 "words": I am a manufacturers rep and drive many miles I've logged 67K miles in 15 months | My Element is reliable roomy has plenty of power on the highway tons of room for me to carry my samples | headroom to accommodate the tallest of passengers legroom to spare | this cute little SUV has it all | plus the lack of carpet makes it so easy to keep clean after a visit to the beach sweeping out the sand is a breeze | The best part for me is that it's ultra easy for my two 80 lb Labradors to jump in and out of The rear seats come out and give them a huge area | Also the seats are washable this is a plus when you have dogs with muddy feet or when you spill your coffee | the Element has it all | 
 "words": At 54 this was my very first new car | ever | Everyone said what great cars Hondas are so I was excited to be buying one and my beloved Element to boot | At 1000 miles it had been in the shop twice for fuel tank sensor issues | Now at just shy of a year and only 5700 miles I am truly disappointed | It IS fun to drive and I love its funny nerd cool look but the quality really lacks | small irritations defrosters are non- existent radio speakers vibrated from the start driver's side doors rattle | I'm a single old guy so it's hardly been given rough treatment | 
 "words": I drove several different vehicles including the tiny Fit and a luxurious CRV but as soon as I got into the Element I knew it was the right one | The kiwi-metallic color puts a smile on my face every time I see it and it is so much fun to drive | The factory stereo BUMPS | Accelerates well enough | I don't drive too aggressively | kid seat fits with tons of room left over | I wish the rear windows rolled down | They pop open but that can be a hassle while driving | The seats are fairly comfortable | A little stiff but that helps a bad back on a long drive | good support | TONS of interior room | Feels like a real sturdy vehicle | Drove WAY better than the Pilot | Never loved a car like I love my Element | 
 "words": We bought the SC and have gotten lots of compliments about its looks | It's very versatile | It's a lot of fun to drive | It handles great for its shape | It has a great sound system and it's a killer tailgating machine | We purchased the legs for the built in table and it works great | We've put over 10000 on it and loved every mile | 
 "words": Great to drive | very good gas mileage for an SUV | 
 "words":  and bad gas mileage | Admittedly moving from an '04 BMW X3 was a questionable decision | But at lease turn back they wanted 3k more for the 04 than we paid for the 08 Honda | We were looking for a smaller carbon footprint | The BMW spewed 20 pounds per 15k miles where the Honda 6 pounds | We were not expecting the poor gas mileage it is a shoebox but still | The absolute biggest pain is the range it has a small tank you would think they could find room for a little bigger gas tank | 
 "words": I thought the ride was buckboard with the 04 X3 but this sc is STIFF | Goes around corners better than the minivan character of the regular models but rear seat passengers need kidney belts | This is she who must be obeyeds and she doesn't complain but has mentioned the stripped down features coming from her X3 no automatic lights or turn down passenger parking mirror bugs her | Really we wanted a smaller footprint carbon and fuel economy but this is only getting 19 mpg on a good day and the X3 was 17-18mpg | 6 pounds of pollution per 15k miles for the Honda and 15 pounds for the X3 | My biggest beef is the short range especially for a brick with bad fuel economy | 
 "words": On our first trip north I had two dogs a kid a 10 horse outboard motor a plug in cooler and 260 miles to drive to our lake | 24 mpg on two lanes with hills | Great utility vehicle and have gotten 28 mpg on the two lanes | 24 on the freeway | We live in MN and it does a great job in the snow also | I may want a more aggressive snow tread though for the back roads | 
 "words": I wanted a more versatile vehicle than the sedans I've driven for years but didn't want a truck-based SUV or minivan | I've owned several Accords and a Civic all great cars but after buying a house needed something to haul stuff on occasion | This well-handling and peppy vehicle fit the bill perfectly | I've been looking for something like this for years | Bought the SC model because I really don't need 4WD and also really liked the Root Beer color which is only available on the SC | It sits lower on larger tires than the EX or LX | It really makes the car sleeker-looking and improves the handling | Love this car and expect to keep it for a long long time | Fits all needs | 
 "words": I bought it for the fun but this is a practical car that I can use for my bikes or camping or the long winters in Wisconsin | And I think it's the most comfortable car I've ever been in | MPG is fair 24-26 mostly highway | MT is silky smooth better than my S2000 | 
 "words": I was looking for an all around vehicle for hauling stuff commuting and occasional 4wd needed when camping but didn | t want a truck and this car fits perfect | Always loved the | funky | looking unique design on the outside but was surprised how big this small SUV is on the inside | More headroom and driver space than my wife | s Suburban | Great for moving furniture trips to Home Depot Costco etc | Consistently get about 22 mpg not bad for an AWD box although I drive fairly conservative lately due to gas prices | Thought the rear moon roof was weird at first but nice to see out of when using seats as a bed | AWD makes this a real blast to drive on dirt roads | 6 months and very pleased | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle after owning a Nissan Pickup for 6 years | I bought it to be able to haul my bikes inside instead of outside in the bed of the pickup | The interior is functional perfect for my needs | The performance is terrible bad hesitation upon acceleration | If you need to accelerate RIGHT now forget it | The tires squeal on almost any sharp corner in rain it feels unsteady like it could hydroplane at any second | Terrible mileage 21 MPH for a 4 cylinder | I honestly think rollover is a problem or will be soon | The sunroof is unusable in that it is in the back and cannot be opened remotely | 
 "words": I picked up a 2008 Element and so far it has been great | The sales person was decent and with the incentives I think it is an excellent buy for anyone looking for a small SUV with good utility uses | Granted it isn't going to pull a huge load but for normal use grabbing a dresser mattress or something like that it will work much better than most smaller SUVs | Any things I might want on this truck are minor | 
 "words": All the stuff I have in it slides all over the place nothing slides in our Suburban the seats hurt my butt and back the headrests puts my head in a weird position I've had two very minor fender benders at very low speeds and each one has resulted in mega repair bills because if the front touches anything it caves in | The paint on the cladding chips easily | Small gas tank means more frequent fill ups rattles I hate hate hate having to get out of the car to close the back windows | 
 "words": I've owned an 06 Element and now just bought an 08 | From road trips with the dogs to hauling 4x6 wood posts and 4x8 plywood back from Lowes in the same load this vehicle has done everything I've wanted it to do | I always remove the backseats out of my Elements it makes things easier to clean and get in and out of | I treat it like a covered pickup with really good fuel economy | 
 "words": bought this Element downsizing from a Ford Explorer with 186k miles | I have more legroom better road visibility passengers in back seats have more legroom than in the Explorer | Pep seems better than the heavy v6 Explorer | The gas mileage has been upsized from 15-16 MPG for the Explorer to 23-25 with the Element | I'm glad I downsized | 
 "words": I work for Honda | i had my choice of any of the models that Honda has | I chose the element for many reason | Looks style diverse interior upscale interior are just a few | I can honestly say that after 6 months I am still as happy as i was the day i bought it | 
 "words": I have owned two Mercedes and two Cadillac autos all new cars plus a Buick Riviera and I can honestly say that this is a far better car than any of them and it costs 1 3 as much | This is due to the carefully thought out design simplicity in all features but most of all very low true cost to own with respect to both maintainability repair costs insurance and related costs | I don | t care about resale value as I intend to keep this jewel for at least 10 years | The ride is great and the 166 bhp is more than adequate power | It also has very responsive steering plus the electronics are all high quality and well conceived designs | 
 "words": Very reliable great ride and great for what I use it for | Best car in its class for a practical life | Easy to clean after the dogs have a dirty day in the park | Easy to get my mountain bikes in and out of | Outstanding for trips to Home Depot or Costco | Also I am 6 ft 3in and this vehicle fits me better then much larger SUV's | 
 "words": Overall the Element is exactly what I have been needing for years | The quality of build is exceptional with the ride and handling as I expected | Before purchasing I read numerous reviews and so far no surprises | It handles the winding backroads to work with ease and gas mileage is as advertised | 
 "words": First off this is my 3rd Honda which says a lot | Customer loyalty I guess | I looked at the CR-V and it was a bit fancy for me | I want my little truck to be a truck | I am going to fill it up with all kinds of stuff ranging from Mulch to Christmas trees | The wipe it clean interior is awesome just for that | Looking at it you would think this is about as aerodynamic as a refrigerator with the door ope | The reality is the thing is VERY well designed | Virtually no exterior noise when cruising along at 65 | Gas consumption is not at all bad considering its a truckish vehicle | Over all this is a really fun SUV and worth every penny | We love it very much | And best of all It's a Honda | 
 "words": My Honda Element has exceeded expectations in nearly every category for affordable transportation | However if you buy an Element draw on my experience be sure to leave the windows slightly open during the heat of the day | Two of my windows have exploded due to heat build up in the cabin | Honda will not warrant this condition and frankly it's an expensive item to replace glass | I watched in horror yesterday as the glass literally popped and fell out of the car when the car was parked in my driveway | Sure my insurance carrier will pay but I owe the deductible and risk higher premiums | I am disappointed that Honda isn't warranting the design flaw | I feel very let down by the warranty
 "words": I traded in my 04 Element and bought the new 08 | Loved my first Element and only traded it because I got a great deal | I live in New England and find the car handles all the weather that we get great | I have taken several trips to New Hampshire | Handles the mountains well |

 "words": It took me 6 months to make up my mind as my 05 Nissan Frontier lease was ending | Looked at all of the econo- boxes just couldn't do it | Couldn't commit to driving a sardine-can for the next 4-5 years despite the price of gas | Between my wife and I we've owned 4 Civics and 1 CR-V over the last years so don't break up a winning streak go back to Honda | This is now Honda 6 | Excellent little truck does all I needed and wanted | kayaks on roof r c sailboat in back room for the Greyhound too | Didn't need leather carpet Bluetooth MP3 either | Just a dependable versatile small SUV | Have been watching Elements since they first came out but were too costly in Canada much better deals in S | FL |

 "words": We had the Element EX-FWD about 3 wks now | we had a Toyota RAV4 prior and now we bought it because of the leg room in the back seats is huge it had high view for the both front seats fold-up rear seats to make the cargo room bigger also love the suspension | I checked on my first 350 miles driving average local Highway combine is 28 | 40 miles per gallon | which is pretty good The bad thing we don't like is whenever we try to backup the vehicle is very hard to see if anything is behind us because the rear seats are actually little higher than the front seats and it block the way of your rear view 
 "words": My sweet toaster is the best car I have ever owned and believe me I have owned a lot of cars i | e | Acura Toyota Chevrolet | I have elderly parents that I have never been able to haul around but with the Element it is very easy for them to get in and out of even in the back with a little step stool | During the winter months is is basically the rolling dog house with my two dogs who totally love riding in it as they can see out of all the windows with the two back seats down | They feel they are special as they are the ones with the sunroof |

 "words": This car is really fun to drive but I do recommend the manual transmission | I test drove both the automatic and manual and definitely found the manual to give more power and also make the car more enjoyable to drive | The car shifts very smoothly and accelerates pretty well | My passengers never have to fight over the front seat anymore as the back seats are just as comfortable with plenty of leg room | I was worried at first that the styling had just caught my attention and I would get sick of it after a week but a few months later I am still in love with my Element | In essence it is a utility vehicle but on the LX trim there are more than enough features to get the job done |
