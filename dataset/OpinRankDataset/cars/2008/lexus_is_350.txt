REVIEWS
 "words": Pros Likes Very silent smooth V6 engine powerful acceleration and pulls hard beyond 4000rpm excellent brakes bulletproof electrics excellent base sound-system vented heated seats great in summer soft plastics are a pleasure to the touch nice LED lighting ambiance inside | Absolutely nothing like a regular Toyota even though people love to say Lexus are overpriced Toyota | NOT | Cons dislikes Too silent for my tastes needs a BMW like I6 grunt awkward position of clock tripmeter odo is not separate navigation takes time to get used to very limited headroom I'm 5'9 and my head brushes the headliner with the seat all the way flat | 
 "words": Bottom Line- Ultimate compromise between sport and luxury | Very quick smooth glides over nicks and crannies in the road | I spend plenty of time on the road- love the silent ride | On the contrary when the pedal hits the mat the engine makes an extremely defined roar | Comfortable as hell up front not so in the back | If I was at the track every day 335i would be my choice | If I needed a car that would accommodate my daily driving with comfort and performance- no brainer- IS350 | Excellent Audio | 
 "words": I just bought a 2008 loaded Lexus IS350 w 7000 miles | this is my 5th Lexus the others being SUV's but have also owned 3 BMW's including a wonderful M3 | The IS350 is a great car | 98 of my driving is city suburb or highway and it performs flawlessly | If I drove major twisties everyday maybe I would have bought another BMW but few of us have the true abilities to push either Lexus or BMW to their honest limits | It has 90 of the BMW capabilities IMHO plus a quieter ride better interior better exterior more reliability and at least an equal resale value | It doesn't scream look at me | hey even the engine and muffler are quiet but power is vastly available when you want it | 
 "words": I love my IS-350 | It is fun to drive comfortable great looking and handles nicely | The prompt response when needed or wanted is awesome when slipping into manual trans mode | Nav system is to be desired | It has some good points and I used it on several occasions to find my way but the voice recognition is worthless | Audio system is OK but it would be nice to see the track name and not just a number on CDs | Limited rear seat leg room could be a problem but I seldom use it so I deal with it | Memory front seats should be standard after all this is a Lexus | 
 "words": I absolutely love my IS 350 | I looked at many cars in this class BMW 335i A4 Acura TL Mercedes C class etc | I really didn't even want to look at the Lexus because everyone seems to be driving Lexuses these days and I wanted something different | However once I saw the IS I changed my mind | We have had no problems and driving is very fun | The car is fast but not as much road noise as other cars had | I had to get the luxury package to get the memory position seats and love having the heated and ventilated front seats | The interior is loaded and very comfortable | 
 "words": I admit that I've only owned my IS350 for about six weeks now but I am very impressed with it so far | My wife drives a 2004 Lexus RX330 so we were already familiar with the outstanding build quality of Lexus vehicles | My last three cars had been Mercedes C-Classes | Those were nice cars but Lexus has left Mercedes in the dust with the standard features power comfort and overall quality of the IS350 | What may be the most impressive is the value of the IS350 for the money spent but that has to compete with the hustle this car shows and the way it hunkers down when going into corners at speed | It is a really fun car to own and drive | 
 "words": Let me start by saying I test drove many cars before selecting the Lexus IS 350 C350 335i G35 G37 CTS | I believe it has the best combination of performance and luxury in this market segment | The car is very fast the interior is terrific with very soft leather and a nice dash layout | The seats are very comfortable | I have the navigation and the Mark Levinson sound system options and the sound is fantastic | The gas mileage is not that great but is costs a little extra to go fast | Best car I have ever owned and the service at the dealership has been excellent | So far I have about 6000 miles with zero problems | Did I mention that this car is fast | And comfortable | 
 "words": So close to being perfect a shame they blew a few details that make it less than so | The luxury sporty balance is second to none | ML stereo sounds wonderful although XM sounds crappy not Lexus's fault it's XM's signal compression | The nav is awful | It suffers from obvious language requirement translation issues in the design cycle such a shame | Stupid limitations and just not user friendly | Nothing about it is intuitive | Speech recognition is worst- in-class inability to recognize simple commands render it unusable | Bluetooth only auto-connects with one phone how dumb is that | Very limited steering wheel controls mean constantly trying to navigate menus | 
 "words": The navigation system on this car it totally useless | No input while driving no turn by turn guidance in unverified areas smaller towns | While driving on a route if you enter a smaller town the guidance stops and you are on your own until you come to major highways | I purchased a Garmin nuvi 760 for my navigation needs works better and guides for all occasions | I should have kept my Acura TL | Much better car | 
 "words": The IS 350 is a very good alternative to the BMW 3-series | I was planning to get a 335i coupe but gave the IS 350 a look and I liked the IS better than the bimmer | Dont get me wrong the BMW handled real nice free maintenance for 4 years is tough to beat but I do most of my driving on the highway so I needed that a car that has both comfort and performance | The IS also looks better than the BMW and it was less noisy dealership told me it was due to run flat tires | 
 "words": I'm shocked at the amount of rattles this car has in the first few thousands miles | As of today 7 squeaks and rattles | I've been to the dealer 7 times with poor results | I was informed that they were noise issues not rattles and to deal with them as the nature of the car | Not the Lexus service they advertise | Do not buy this car if squeaks and rattles bother you | 
 "words": The Lexus IS 350 is still more luxury than sports sedan | Straight-line performance is fantastic and the automatic transmission is smooth | I am a tall large guy and this car fits me well due largely to a very adjustable driver's seat | The intake and exhaust notes could be more pronounced like on the BMW 3 | The brakes and tires are high-performance versions something tells me to compete better in comparos with the 3-series and will wear out quickly so be prepared to replace them often or get the less performance- oriented higher-mileage substitutes | The body styling is wonderful this car is truly curvy and beautiful | 
 "words": I came from driving a highly modified Toyota MR2 turbo | I miss the stick but the smooth powerful acceleration more than makes up for it | The car is quiet sometimes too quiet and the ride is firm but smooth | I have around 2000 miles on so far and enjoy every mile of driving this car | I feel so grown up driving this car too | 
 "words": I test drove the 335i G35 G37 Acura TL and A4 | The BMW was easily the best driving car in every aspect more refined fluid and precise by far | I went with the IS because of the reliability for my wife plus she liked the interior | So far the IS has been in the shop four times for squeaks rattles | The car handles like a Buick compared to the BMW | The suspension is harsh and the car has needless understeer always pushing and sliding the front end beyond the intended arc | There really is no feel in the controls steering throttle and brakes | If your near retirment age and want a melow driving exp this car is great | Fit and finish are great and the car does have a strong engine | 
 "words": The IS 350 is a great car | Beautiful inside and out | Very fast | You will never want for power | I traded in a 350Z anniversary and this car is faster | Great sound system | Love the seats | Looked at all the cars in this class and this car is better in every way | Test this car last because you will love it and buy it | Black with tan is hot | It turns heads eveywhere I go | 
 "words": Pros power handling ride comfort overall appearance decent gas mileage considering its 306 HP output quiet and smooth | Cons poor instrument panel on the center console | HORRIBLE FUZZY LED panel not a defect all ISs are like that Gas mileage could be better lack of remote start even by a third party | 
 "words": Have only put 500 miles on our new black with cashmere interior | Initial observataions build quality excellent power dramatic | Interior very comfortable for two in the front seats | I think the back seats are for children only | The placement of the driver's power window buttons is odd and uncomfortable to access otherwise interior layout is good | Despite the large engine I have so far averaged 26 mpg for mostly highway driving | That is outstanding | Test drove one with the sport suspension | the wife thought it was much too harsh there really is quite a difference so you should try both |

 "words": The IS is just amazing | What a car the best looking car I have seen in a long long time and wow the interior rocks | Thought just a little about buying the ES but not a chance when I seen the IS ES looks now too much for the older Buick type of a crowd | The car is just fun love to drive it and can't wait to drive it everyday | 
 "words": As a Lexus enthusiast I was excited to trade in my 02 IS300 for an upgrade to all the new technology that is instilled in the 08 IS350 | Interior comfort and performance is premier but after many trips to the garage I still feel that my IS 300 had superior styling | I was hoping that after many hours of staring that I would fall in love 
 "words": My IS 350 has been in shop 6 times 21 days for 8 squeaks and rattles in the 2 months of ownership | I've never owned a car with so many issues regarding squeaks and rattles | I very disappointed with my IS at this time | What happen to the Lexus quality from 10 years ago | My last Lexus never had such issues as this car does | 
 "words": The car is Lexus what else needs to be said | While people complain about the car being too tame it's no more than an excuse because all the vehicle control systems can be disabled easily with the press of a button | Once that's done the car is fun as Hell | People who know quality know Lexus is top notch | To love a car is to love the detail and detail is one thing Lexus pays attention to in every car | 
 "words": My last car was a 2001 BMW 330 | I like the power of the Lexus | The car is much quieter then the BMW | both cars are first class | The Lexus looks too much like a compact car | At the same time it still come with a lot of luxury | The cost of the Lexus is pretty high too | I plan to keep this car for around 5 years | We'll have to see how much it cost to keep it up | 
 "words": I love this car | It's so much fun I love the power | I had a 2002 Celica GT before this with like 140 HP and now I have 309 HP and omg it's awesome | My Celica was a manual and unfortunately the IS 350 only comes in automatic which I don't like at all but the paddle shifter's are ok | I'd still prefer a manual though | The interior of the car is was sold me | I love everything about it | The outside could be more aggressive but they make body kit's now so that's what I'm getting | Overall the car is so awesome | so much fun |
