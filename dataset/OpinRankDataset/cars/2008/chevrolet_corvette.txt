 "words": I have an 08 convertible with the 3LT option and my wife has the 08 coupe with the Z51 option and the dual mode exhaust | I did not get the exhaust option on mine or the Z51 option and quickly wanted to drive her car instead | Now I've added a GM performance exhaust system to mine and wooooo | However I am now already looking at jumping on an 09 model as they now offer the cyber grey color | I hope to get a dealer to put me into that car otherwise my wife and I can still enjoy our two 08 models | Now I will shop for an 09 with the dual mode exhaust and Z51 options exclusively | 
 "words": talk about fun | 6 spd and 430hp with 10 inch wide rear wheels and a rocking stereo to boot | there is nothing like sitting in the cockpit looking out over that long hood and curvy wheelwells while running from 3rd to 6th gear merging on the interstate | a truely genuine classic | 
 "words": This is my first Vette since my 1969 convertible | The performance is exceptional | The aerodynamics are well engineered the car actually feels like it's attached to the road extremely solid and smooth on the highway | Low end torque is so powerful that you never have to rev the engine past 2200 RPM if you don't want to | The shift linkage is very smooth and short coupled | Steering wheel controls are unnecessary because the stereo and HVAC dash controls are perfectly position right above your hand when on the shifter | The panel is a throw back to the 63-67 series my favorite | I'm 62 and I absolutely love every minute I spend in this car it's a delight to own and drive |

 "words": Purchased new in March of 09 | 0 financing and steep discount was enough to convince | The car looks fantastic in Velocity Yellow | Turns heads around town | Averaging over 21 MPG | 
 "words": AI bought an 08 with 5000 miles on it | It has Z-51 dual mode and 6 speed manual | Performance is outstanding dual mode is fun | Z-51 suspension is on the stiff side | It is OK in states with smooth roads but would be bothersome in northern climates with cracked pavement | Overall a well built car so far | 
 "words": I had never owned a Corvette before purchasing a new 2008 crystal red metalic coupe | I thought that I could not afford one yet and then the Chevrolete employee pricing was offered | I had planned to wait another 5 years before taking the plung but the price was right sooner | I had never even been in a Vette or even test driven a Vette until my purchase | I just knew I wanted one | I couldn't be any more pleased with color speed and acceleration interior | I love everything about this car | Everyone else loves it too | To all you who have put off purchasing the new C6 Corvette | go do it you'll not regret it |

 "words": This is my 11th Corvette since I was 18 | I have had a pretty wide spread of years and this 2008 steals the show | Very docile in traffic but packs a heck of a punch when desired | I had a fast 1972 LT1 car that this one would probably beat and be more comfortable doing it | The electronic suspension control really steps up to the plate when needed | Thanks Chevy you're number 1 in my book | 
 "words": I finally pulled the trigger when Chevy had the employee pricing | I couldn't be happier with the car | The acceleration is breathtaking | The lines of the car are sharp and a real eye catcher | My only complaint on this beast is the stereo sound system | For 70K put a good sound system in | I purchased the atomic orange Z06 and it accelerates like an atomic bomb and the roar of the exhaust is better than the stereo anyways | I have owned a 1990 Vette and the technology now is just unbelievable especially the Z06 | Am I happy with the car heck yes | 
 "words": I bought this car strictly for the performance | It is not a daily driver for me | This is my first Vette | I test drove TT335I IS350 G35 | The power of this car with NPPZ51 and 6 speed manual is a rush | Nothing compares in this price range | I do think the seats could be more comfortable and I will replace the run flats with Pilot Sports when worn out | The targa top pops over large bumps | I've been told that is a common issue but easy to fix | When driving aggressively I sometimes have troulbe finding 3rd gear | Bought the Mild to Wild dual mode exhaust controller and run it open all the time | The sound is awesome | Overall very happy with it and can't wait to get back in it | 
 "words": It is a privilage and pleasure to own and drive a 2008 Crystal Red 427 special edition Z06 Corvette | I thought seriously about buying a Nissan GTR but after seeing the GTR in person I felt it remined me of a fancy Nissan Altima with new fenders | The engine sounded tame and boring | It just didnt excite me much | In contrast just standing near the Z06 Corvete and looking at it makes your heart race | I fell in love with this sexy beast from the moment it rumbled to life with a push of the button | The car looks twice in good in person as it does in pictures and sounds beautiful | It's incredibly fun to drive and I have to beat the girls away from it | I absolutly love it | 
 "words": I've been looking to buy a new Corvette for about 3 months | With GM reporting a sales decrease of 45 for October I knew now was the time to pull the trigger | I bought the machine silver 2008 convertible with titanium interior and a black top | It looks great in the garage and I smile everytime I open the garage door | Absolutely no buyer's remorse | The only reason I gave the interior design a 9 is because I can't plug my MP3 into the stereo | what's that all about | The NPP dual mode exhaust is cool as hell and the magnetic selective ride rocks | If you're thinking at all about buying one of these don't wait any longer | Now's the time do get a great deal on a great American sports car | 
 "words": Purchased a 2005 auto Vette 11 05 and had nothing but trouble with it mostly electronics | I took a chance and purchased a 2008 12 15 07 with six speed and very little in options | What a car | The ride is better my wife hated the ride in the 2005 and it is a joy to drive | The color is Crystal Red and is an attraction where ever we ago | Gas mileage is around 25 mpg | The six speed has enhanced the overall enjoyment even when in traffic which is common in the DFW area freeways | My next Vette will be the ZR1- I hope |

 "words": I have owned five Corvettes in my life but my 2008 is the first new one I have had | In 2004 I bought a beautiful black 2002 convertible and I really loved it then I began reading about the 2008 and the new engine and I figured since I had just turned 60 I would by a new Corvette | I ordered a Crystal red convertible ebony interior dual mode exhaust and LT3 package | I have not been disappointed it handles like a dream it feels so tight and manageable and when you just step on the gas not floor it you are doing 70 before you know it but the best part is that almost every time I take it out strangers will stop and tell me that is the best looking car I've ever seen | No problems | 
 "words": Driving either on the track or milk runs to Safeway is really enjoyable | Magnetic shocks energized for comfort or tighter sport ride is the way to go for me | No wonder the ZR1 is using similiar technology | Gas mileage has a wide range | from 13 in town to truly over 3l mpg on the freeways |

 "words": I'm not one for american cars | Honda and Toyota are the quality I expect | So spending 45K on this car was a huge gamble for me | If Toyota or Honda made a real supercar then there would be no Vette in my garage | But I have to say without a doubt this is one of the best cars in America today | Built with quality and not one problem so far | Very happy with the performance 26MPG on the highway and the fit and finish that will match anything from Japan | The 08 is much more than the 07 model | Hold out for a 08 you will be glad you did | Excellent ride and performance for the money | Much nicer dash layout than any other year Vette | I'm just so happy the fit and finish is as nice as it is | Also Chevy is finally after all these years making the dash layout worth looking at | Seeing the same dash components in the Vette as the Chevette is one reason I waited so long to get one | Much better dash interior than the previous years | Go and get one |

 "words": This is my 5th Vette | The 08 LS3 is so smooth | The interior upgrades were overdue and really enhance the overall quality of the car | The 6 speed auto works well for high traffic cities while the paddles allow for manual pleasures when desired | When comparing my Vette to my brother's Cobra Mustang I really appreciate the refined cockpit and nicely placed shifter interior controls and the overall feel and control of a 400hp monster | If you can afford one you would be crazy not to buy one | 
 "words": I have been having constant problems with my new Z06 | 1 | The automatic shift from 1st to 4th light does not comes on and off whether I am actually shifting from 1st to 4th | Sometimes the vehicle will not let me fill a full tank instead it only allows me to fill 1 2 a tank | My traction light comes on and off whenever it wants and it seems the rear end is slipping | When I make wide slow turns the steering wheel gets rock hard and I have to really hold it tight as if I didnt have power steering | When I pull my vehicle up to my drive way I hear the roof of the car crackling as if the roof is shifting | My power seat control went out the first week of owership and they had to replace it |

 "words": First Vette hated previous generations | The C6 made me a believer | The C6 is awesome from a thank god six cogger tranny to a really nice interior | It is no Porsche but it no longer a fancy or more powerful mustang or camaro either | Try it you will love it | I sold my E500 for this I am am thrilled with it the new 6 | 2 is breathtaking and the optional exhaust can't be described must be heard | Also windows crack open when door opens a la BMW for an airtight seal | Way to go GM | 
 "words": I traded in my 2005 C6 with z51 for a 2008 base model 6m with just the Z51 option | I purchased the new 2008 for just under 42kthats around 800 under invoice | The new car is almost like a night and day difference | The new c6 has a much nicer interior much tighter and quiter ride much better shifting and steering and last but not least the power of the new engine | I can defenitely tell the difference in acceleration | I think Chevy under estimated the 430 horses to make a larger gap in horse power for the Z06 | This new car is just simply amazing | 
 "words": I told my son I was going to trade my 2004 Z06 Commemorative on a new base convertible and he said Oh man don't sell that car | I love that car | He's a really good kid so I gave it to him he's very happy then started looking | I didn't know much about the C6 got a recommended dealer to send me a brochure decided going from Z06 to base is not cool | He had a red one with 2LZ and a black one with 3LZ coming in within the next two months and I bought the red one | He took pictures of it being unloaded | It is awesome | I ran out of space in Suggested Improvements so will add Be sure you know what you get in 3LZ before you order it | I'm not too sure about that one for 3500 | 
 "words": The all new 2008 Corvette is exactly that | From a new Jetstream Blue exterior a revamped upscale interior 36HP increase and a new exhast system the new feature enhancements are extraordinary | The new Jetstream Blue exterior really stands out in the crowd | The 4LT interior Linen Ebony finally puts Corvette in the luxury realm | The 436 HP puts the Vette way above any other car in the price range | The optional Z06 style butterfly exhaust makes the car really sound like a Vette should right from the start | I added an optional remote that lets me control the exhaust butterfly | I owned a 2004 C5 prior to this C6 and was completely blown away at how much better this car is over my C5 | 
 "words": Love my new 2008 Coupe | I traded my 04 Z06 Commemorative for it and haven | t looked back | This car is a dream to drive a computer on wheels | 
 "words": Did the museum delivery | It was amazing | People were great | Was very interesting seeing the manufacturing | Really appreciated the people's commitment to the Corvette | The car is great | Very tight | My 10 year old did the best one word explanation of the car calling it sick 
 "words": I love this new Vette | It is a rocket ship and has way more power than anything in the same price class and even as fast as much more expensive cars like the Porsche 911 S | It does not handle as well as the German sports cars like Porsche or BMW but it has gobs of power | I was doing 90 in 3rd gear | Amazing design and much better than the 2006 model | Now if Chevy can improve the poor handling it would be the ultimate sports car | 
 "words": I had a Honda for transportation and a Harley for fun | My father had just bought an 04 convertible and I had my first drive in it two weeks ago | I got the bug | I test drove an 07 and didn't feel much more power than the 04 | Plus the interior was cheesy | Drove the 08 LT1 and and when I punched it the first time an involuntary expletive burst out of my mouth | I could not believe that this car was street legal | The LS3 engine is night and day from the LS2 | Plus the interior was much nicer | I couldn't wait for an LT2 or 3 and bought it that day | Run don't walk to the dealership and get one of these | You won't regret it | 
 "words": For years I've stayed away from the Vette because of poor quality interior and poor feedback response | I've owned a S2000 350z modified twin turbo Audi S4 and Lexus SC430 | I can honestly say I'm impressed with every aspect of the care especially the great handling and daily livability | Feedback response is not as crisp as the S2000 but its good enough to instill confidence | The interior is so much better now it feels like a luxury sports car on-star turn-by- turn navigation radio frequency keyless entry start coach-like leather and tactile sensation of each dial button phone | Every day I find something more to like and I'm a hard person to please when it comes to details
 "words": The acceleration is exhilerating especially when the 2 valves in the exhaust opens | It is like afterburners in a jet | The tight handling is unbelieveable | It sticks to the road like glue and comes out of curves smooth as silk | When driving this car all worries of the day seem to disappear |
