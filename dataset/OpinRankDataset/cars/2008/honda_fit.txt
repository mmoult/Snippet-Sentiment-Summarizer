 "words": My criteria was simple an economical inexpensive high quality vehicle that could carry a companion a bike a kayak personal stuff and not require a small mortgage payment when I stopped for gas | The Fit is all that and more with a 5 star insurance rating and is actually fun to drive - especially around town or on curvy back roads | Honda has proved that inexpensive doesn't have to mean cheap | This vehicle has more secret storage spots and room than many SUVs I've driven | Oh - and did I mention 32 to 38 M | P | G |

 "words": I stumbled on the Fit completely by accident walking through the dealership looking to buy a Civic and walked out driving it | The fold flat seats were an immediate seller for me as no trunk can hold the things the Fit can | I think I probably paid a little too much at 15900 for the MT but I was in a time crunch | My Fit came with sweet tinted windows that I would strongly suggest to anyone it makes the car look very unique and sporty not to mention keeping your seats from bleaching and reducing theft | I have tracked my MPG for the first 4000 miles and I | m getting 26 36 | The M T is definitely the way to go must quicker than my A T 127 hp | 03 Civic | I would recommend this car to anyone |

 "words": After looking at everything I decided on my fit and I am fit to be tied with happiness | Mileage is excellent in fact I just filled it up and it took 8 gal of gas for 324 miles | Being retired and almost 70 years of age I can stay with almost anything on the road | It is comfortable in town and on the road | No wind noise Cruise control works great and since I have the sport model I get compliments every day | I almost bought a Mazda 3 but then when you consider the resale value the fit is the only choice | They now have some great trick stuff to customize your fit and I look for excuses to drive it | Oh I used to drive an avalanche and loved it | It's an outstanding car go buy one | 
 "words": Exceeded my expectations | It's fun to drive | Interior is very quiet and feels soo much larger than exterior dimensions | Interior is also very flexible creating a large space with great height | I'm 6'2 and have tons of room except for right foot | Now I keep my Crew Cab at home and love running around in this | My kids have plenty of room too | Stereo is great | Build quality seems exceptional | could easily make this your only car | So far averaging 31 | 6 mpg in all city errand driving | exceeding my expectations |

 "words": I finally traded my gas guzzler SUV for a Sports Fit | After doing the research and driving the car I purchased my orange Fit | I had to adjust to less suspension a rougher road ride than before | I loved the quick turn action and actually entered the freeway and hit 60 mph in six seconds | It performs nicely and I came from Mercedes and Nissan Pathfinder | I love my little car more features included than on the Matrix | I definitely saw the quality in this buy over its competition | 
 "words": Honda DNA car is fun to drive efficient cargo utilization good expected mileage have not used a full tank yet | Excellent ABS brakes turns on a dime responsive stering and fast | Mine is black beautifull | My wife and I love it | Very practical This is our 4th Honda | We also have an 05 Element EX | The only recommendation I have is that Cruise and remote keyless entry should be otions offered on the base model | All of this for less than 15 grand with auto and air and a bunch of airnags | Fantastic | Find a good Honda dealer and buy one soon | 
 "words": When going to the Honda Dealership I was looking into purchasing a Civic | I only wanted to spend 15000 | 00 on a car | I noticed that I was not geeting rims spoiler or fog lights with the Civic | The sales repp showed me the Fit and I was worried because I have never heard of it | Come to find out the Fit had better seats and better options in than the Civic | The Fit is really comfortable and sporty looking | I have been very happy with it | The 1st day I took it to work the whole office was asking who's red honda is parked out side | It's very nice | I have been able to haul stuff to the dump | My Father In Law has been reading the reviews and really loves the car himself |

 "words": So it looks tiny from the outside inside it's surprisingly roomy and it's kind of ugly in an endearing sort of way | but the more I drive this car the more I love it | It is the most functional fuel efficient and fabulously fun car I have ever owned | My step-mom has a convertible Saab and my father has a Mercedes S class | You know what | I prefer driving my Fit better than driving their gas guzzling money pits | The Fit corners like it's on rails | If you know how to properly use the paddle shifters the car will straight out fly because it's so light | But if you're stuck in bumper to bumper traffic just drive it as an automatic | It's unique easy on the wallet and flat out fun | 
 "words": After trading in my Mercedes 300SD and my Buick LeSabre for something more fuel efficient | I found the Fit to be exactly what I was looking for in a commuter car | It has plenty of room more so then it looks | I did have to spend an extra 500 on accessories to finish the car | Accessories such as floor mats wheel lock cargo cover bumper appliqué | The gas mileage is amazing | The first tank started at 33 MPG the 2nd tank is at 36 MPG the 3rd tank is up to 39 | 5 MPG who know what the next tank will bring | I have to confess I have not been running the A C since the weather is still cool | I do expect the mileage to drop a couple of MPG when I fire up the A C | I am happy with the car | 
 "words": The 5 spd MT Sport has more than enough get up and go with the 100 horse at under 2500 lbs | Great handling but at a cost of firm ride | Of course firmness lends itself to the noisy buzz at hwy speeds but easily tolerable when taking the Avg 31 mpg on first tank into effect | And that's before engine break-in | Can't wait to see the MPG 's with a KN typhoon system that adds 5hp at the 5-10K mile mark | Obviously parking space is no longer an issue anywhere | 
 "words": This car was a big disappointment after driving it for a couple of weeks | The engine build quality fuel economy and fun to drive factor were all there | However the seating position and lack of a dead pedal left me feeling very uncomfortable | The gas pedal is too close to the driver which resulted in constantly lifting one's foot off the accelerator in order to properly control the throttle | Move the seat back too far and you can't reach the clutch and steering wheel | Also the lack of a dead pedal or even a flat spot leaves one's foot on a round bump | This was such a shame because the car really zips around and is fun to drive | The new FIT is out this fall I advise to wait | 
 "words": The Honda Fit was purchased for economic utility and it serves those ends admirably | It is very well designed and as far as I can tell at this point very well manufactured | The interior space when all the rear seats are folded flat is amazing | The front seats are fr more comfortable than they look although the upholstery seems to attract every bit of fluff in the area | It's not a vehicle that flourishes at high speeds | the engine becomes very busy and high-speed stability is not a strong point | But for the purposes cited above I know of nothing to equal it currently available on the market | 
 "words": I've had the Fit for only 6 months and I like it more and more everyday | Gas mileage is great | There is so much cargo space for such a little car | I can fit my Mountain Bike in the back without having to break it down | Love the cargo space | Its great in the snow for such a little car | This little car has some power behind it | The ratio between the steering wheel and the pedals is a bit uncomfortable | I think a telescoping steering wheel would easily solve this | Sound system is loud and on the loudest setting no static | 
 "words": I've only had my Fit Sport for a month but the word surprise keeps coming to mind | I'm a big 6'-1 and | eh not dainty | This car is more comfortable than the Dakota P U it replaces and gets twice the gas mileage | I drove from RI to NY and back with my two sisters in one day they were both impressed with it's relative comfort over 400 miles | The Fit is fun and light on it's feet on curvy roads like driving a go-cart | I'm a dog trainer having space for a pet divider or dog crate is crucial | the seats fold flat in an instant to accommodate even XL crates and there's tie downs in the floor to secure them | Fit finish and ergonomics are all top notch at a lower cost than most hybrids | 
 "words": Well first off I gave the 2008 Honda fit sport auto trans 10 rating on every thing I really really like this car I had driven this car in Brazil in 2004 way before they came here and just fell head or heals for the car but I drive this car to work at 5 | 00am no traffic all highway 15 miles one way so we will say 80-85 highway and that is low the first 700 miles I got 17 mpg from 700 to 1600 got 24 mpg drove from Champaign il to Cincinnati last week end all highway no stopping 70 miles per got 27 mpg then Champaign to ind 2 days ago got 28 mpg so if it was summer and I had the ac on and driving in a city I can't see more then 17 or 18 mpg so I will be trading this in soon for a Toyota 
 "words": This is one very Nice car | For the price nothing was left out | Fun to drive | Tight on turns and rapid acceleration | All in all everything honors ots name | It is a tight fit | Interior volume is hard to judge from the outside only appreciated once seating in | 
 "words": I just got my 2008 Honda FIT Sport Trim with Automatic | I love every bit of it | It is stylish fun to drive excellent room and great gas mileage | The only things needed are power driver seat intermittent rear windshield wiper with washer center console actual oil change specification automatic headlights on at dark Also include as standard floor mats rear cargo cover and multiple 12 volt DC plugs and several 120 volt AC plugs | I highly recommend the Automatic Sport Trim FIT you can go with the automatic or shift without touching a clutch | The AC and radio are GREAT | I also recommend the 8 year 100000 mile extended warranty cargo cover and extra window tinting | 
 "words": When we went looking for a car we had never heard a Fit much less saw of one | After having seen one my wife said It looks like if got punched in the nose | Needless to say we were less than impressed | at first | Once we saw the type of room inside you can fit an Alpaca for God's sake we were intrigued | After the test drive it was time to do some online research | A week later we drove home in our new little buddy | I parked my Mazda RX-8 in the garage and was able to pay for the Fit with gas savings alone | After 6 months we already have 20000 miles on it and it still runs like a champ | The only issue was a dent received in a parking lot and a cracked windshield | We love it | 
 "words": Just got my car last month | I've put 1000 miles on it so far and I am rather pleased | the only item i have regrets with is not having cruise control | i am getting 30-32 mpg which is double what my previous car was getting | I only wish i could have waited to take a look at the 2009 fit | 
 "words": I traded a 2000 Dodge Dakota Quad cab 4 | 7L V-8 for a 2008 Honda Fit 1 | 5L I- 4 | What was I thinking | I'll tell you what I was thinking | After 3 months of research and test drives this is simply the best car period | It may not be as large as a Hummer or as cushy as a Caddy but this beats just about every other car on the market in the price you pay versus standard features and gas mileage | This results in much less engine noise | After 2000 miles | I commute 50 mi each way half interstate half stop and go | I have yet to get less than 33 MPG averaging 78 on the Interstate portion | And I can still pack in 8 2x6 8ft boards | FYI | At 70 MPH the AT runs the engine 1K RPM lower than the MT | 
 "words": This car runs and runs fast | You will think there is a bigger motor than the mini mill | All the Honda quality is there and not any real issues | You may have to live without a few items but the gas pump will not make you pay | The lack of a dead pedal is not a problem either | The driving position is a bit awkward on a long road trip | It is workable however | This car is highly recommended | Keep looking and find a dealer who will work with you and don't buy from the arrogant Honda dealer | 
 "words": I traded my '04 Accord as I needed more space and maximum mileage | The Fit hasn't disappointed | I average 36- 37 mpg in open and rush-hour driving | I've carried lots of cargo including a 46 TV upright right behind the driver's seat | Seating configurations are great | It's easy and fun to drive maneuver and park | The only thing I miss from my Accord which I loved is the automatic temperature control | 
 "words": Bought at 08 Fit Sport 5AT in blaze orange in Dec 07 for my 20 yr old son | Was so impressed bought same car for myself 3 weeks ago in Milano red | MPG reading on first 200 miles of driving was 33 | 3 in mix of city interstate driving on 12-mile commute | I got my Fit for 50 over invoice which was hard to believe if stories of 4 gallon gas this summer come true | There are a lot of people driving big trucks and SUVs that get 10-12 MPG in real world driving that are going to be severely impacted | Supply and demand drives the prices for goods and services and if Americans would start driving high-MPG vehicles and cut our national consumption we would see gas prices fall by 1 gallon | 
 "words": After getting through a terrible ordeal with the dealership my Honda Fit is great | I'll list my cons first I agree with comments that there should be a center arm rest a dead pedal next to the clutch | I also wish that the rear window wiper had an intermittent speed | There is quite a bit of road noise coming up from the floor at highway speed | On a day to day basis though these things do not really bother me | Having used an automatic transmission Fit while waiting for my real car I definitely recommend the manual transmission and would not even buy an automatic in this model | I love the zippiness of my Fit the sound system is good | It is so cute well designed fun to drive | 
 "words": I was excited to get the fit but disappointed when I realized it maxed out at 35 mpg | In reality I'm getting 25 mpg and I drive mostly on the HWY | I hear this will get better in time | Right now Honda is purposefully not making many Fits to drive demand | Most dealerships are charging an additional 1500 to every car because of this false demand Honda is creating | Also the Fit does not come with floor mats | When you buy them you can't just lay them down but you need to cut into the floor of the car | What were they thinking with that | Overall I do like the fit | It's fun to drive and looks cool in my opinion | Its a Honda so I trust it will be reliable | Time will tell | 
 "words": I bought this car right off the delivery truck | and at first absolutely loved it | However after driving it for awhile I have found some issues with it but all around and for the price it's a good little car |

 "words": My decision to purchase the Fit seems smarter everyday | It gets an overall average 33 mpg it fits all my music gear and it's fun to drive | I've had 4 adults in it comfortably and 5 adults in it for a thankfully short trip without complaint | It more than satisfies my needs and I get to have fun and be thrifty while I get to work practices and errands | It handles fantastically and it feels like it feels faster than it is which I like | Pretty decent stereo 6 speakers and the dash is attractive and well laid out | My only complaint is the car came standard with window tinting I guess it did because I can't see any tinting anywhere | That's just a quibble | Overall I'd recommend it for anyone | 
 "words": I own my own shop and my son who is 14 wanted to do up a Honda so we bought a used Civic with 190000 miles and added bolt ons | The performance increase was outstanding and gas mileage did not suffer thus I decided to buy a new Honda due to gas prices | I never heard of the Fit but my son did some research | Well we bought the Fit and I must say that around town im getting 34mpg the vehicle is worth every penny and the comfort level is superb | This vehicle is worth thousands more so get yours while they are still resonable | I rate it 10 out of 10
 "words": The last time I filled my Jeep it cost me 74 and vowed the following weekend to get rid of it | I wanted a Honda Civic but after driving that and the Fit I was hooked on the Fit | This is an amazing big car stuck in a little car body | The outside appears to be so compact yet once inside there is so much room it's unbelievable | I am happy with aspect of this car so far | The cargo capacity is huge and the comfort is what's expected of a small car so not bad at all | The ability to maintain in traffic is there I have no trouble with acceleration or braking | I am so pleased with the performance I sometimes forget I am driving a compact car | I would recommend to anybody with kids and pets | 
 "words": I now have 5000 miles on my Fit all in winter | Average of all fuel use is 36 mpg | When I first started looking for a new car I fell in love with the Fit | Looked at half a dozen probably suitable models and the Fit was the only one that affected me that way | Everything about it suited what I needed and test drives on highway and suburban roads were FUN | Still have trouble believing such an economical car has features such as ABS brakes cruise control and so many safety features my insurance is no higher than for the 10-yr old car I replaced | And the car is CUTE | Still haven't gotten over how cute | Unlike some others I like the TPMS | It's worked for me | 
 "words": Just got the car a month ago | Originally read that it would be too small for me | I'm over 6 feet tall | This car is big enough for me and people taller than me with no problems | It has huge interior and cargo area | It performs like a sports car | Unlike other people reviewing this car I have no problems with road noise at 80 mph and can hear the radio just fine | It has a stiff suspension so on bumpy roads these will transmit into the cockpit but on most good roads the ride is quiet | 
 "words": We needed a good commuter car that was reasonably priced and good gas mileage | After reading all the reviews I could find it became apparent the Fit was the way to go | We were sold on it at as soon as we test drove one | In our area it was hard to find the Sport with the manual transmission | We love this car it is amazing how such a small car can fit 4 large people fairly comfortably | For the price it is the best deal out there | 
 "words": This is for anyone like me that was very hesitant to buy such a little car | I wrestled back and forth between the Civic and Mazda3 wagon | When I sold my gas guzzling truck for less than I hoped to get for it I only could afford the Fit | I've only had this a short time but I could not be happier with the Fit | This thing feels so much bigger inside then what it looks like | I find it to be a huge surprise and I'm relly digging this little thing | If you are walking the fence on this car I would suggest taking a long test drive | You may find what I found | This is a great car and Honda will have a huge hit on there hands | 
 "words": First going from a V6 to a 4 cyl engine is a huge adjustment | The blue back lit display is very easy to read | Nice large display | My biggest complaint is that the engine does not like to accelerate | Especially from a stop | Once it gets going it is ok | I recently moved and being able to fold down the back seats flat helped a lot in moving | Given the attention to safety that Honda gives it is too bad that the ABS traction control and stability control are not standard features | The steering wheel does not telescope so I am having to reach and there is no center console | I have been doing mostly city driving in heavy traffic so the gas mileage is not what it was advertised to be | 
 "words": Pro Great space utilization | Quick and direct handling | Incredibly good gear shift linkage | Good interior controls | Fairly economical 33MPH in northern winter | Adequate horsepower for my purposes | Con Very short wheelbase yields a somewhat choppy ride | VERY firm suspension doesn't help | Lots of wind and tire noise at 75 MPH so high that I won't use the radio above 65MPH | Geared short 20MPH 1kRPM which makes noise worse | Wanted to buy a set of snow tires the the tire pressure sensors double the per wheel cost | My 1997 Honda Civic got better gas mileage | I just wish I hadn't totaled it | 
 "words": Excellent good handling good audio easy to drive excellent on gas very roomy fun to drive |

 "words": This vehicle handles well and is a joy to drive | However the road noise is greater than what I expected and the radio reception is unacceptable with constant static on local FM stations | The radio is fine as long as the car is not in motion | It immediately begins to crackle when in motion | The car has plenty of power for it's size and the gas mileage is wonderful | The head rests are set at a severe angle for short people and can't be adjusted unless a person removes them and reinstalls them backwards with the angle toward the back seat |

 "words": We bought the Fit due to the great gas mileage and the design of the folding back sit | It works great | It is a very versatile car | The back holds a lot more than it appears to be able to hold | The gas mileage is between 27 with mostly city driving to 41 with all highway driving | It has a good average of 30 to 32 MPG combo | The only thing I wish it would redesign is that the gas tank hold more than 10 | 8 gal | It seems to go through gas faster that way | A 12 to 13 would be great | I average about 280 to 400 miles per fill up | This car is a great buy | Plus another added feature is it shows percent of oil life so it takes the guess work out of when to change the oil | AC works great too |

 "words": The Honda Fit has been a great car so far | Not only do I average 32-33 miles per gallon less on E10 unfortunately the tight steering and quick shifter makes every drive enjoyable | With only 109 horsepower it's not a stoplight racer but the 1 | 5 L mill is more than adequate for driving in the city and pulling the Fit's 2600 lbs up to highway speeds | While it's no plush luxury car the Fit's interior space belies its diminutive size as four people can fit in the Fit in relative comfort | Then with a few clicks of the magic seats you can fill the car with furniture boxes etc |

 "words": We bought our Fit last September | Had to order because they were in short supply | It is a manual transmission the only way to go in my opinion as it is very peppy and fun to drive | Have been getting up to 44 mpg in ideal conditions but usually in the mid to upper 30's with a mix | Strictly town it has been under 30mpg at times | So mpg varies widely depending on how you drive and what kind of traffic | The manual transmission is so fun to drive that mpg can suffer from that | The best mpg is conservative driving | It has an amazing amount of cargo space and that is what really sold us on this car | We keep the back seats folded down almost all of the time | We love this car | 
 "words": This car amazes me with all the space this car has to offer I was looking for a wagon but I can't afford the price of VW Jetta Passat Audi and some other wagons on the market the Honda fit is very useful affordable very well made excellent handling nice ride 
 "words": I've had my 2008 Sport Fit for 6 weeks | I purchased it for two reasons fuel economy and the ability to park in those tiny San Francisco street spots | I recently took a road trip of about 500 miles | I was amazed that even with 2 teenagers loaded with camping gear and driving w the A C on | I still managed 40 mpg | Amazing |

 "words": The Honda fit brings something new to the world of compacts | standards | Everything that was called an option before is now standard | Loads of airbags ABS power windows the works | Its all standard | Sure somethings could have been better but for the most part having standards doesn't make me ask the dealer to fetch a model that has all the features I want | Only drawback is that I don't see myself using this car for a cross country road trip although the loads of space and adjustable seats does suggest that it would be a good idea | Great for a daily commuter | 
 "words": I've had this car now for about 3 months and have put close to 3000 miles on it | So far so good | It is really fun to drive | It drives like a sports car and handles extremely well | It feels super responsive | Minor complaints It has developed a slight rattle squeak in the dash when on a slightly bumpy street | Also the A C will sometimes smell bad when first turned on this goes away after 10 seconds or so I need to take it to the dealer as I hear this is a common problem with newer car AC systems | Otherwise I can't think of anything bad about it | I've been recommending it to friends that are looking for a new car |

 "words": I get to write another review because we got a second Fit | After such a good experience with our first Fit purchased at the end of March we found we could hardly bear to drive our Dodge Grand Caravan | too ponderous and the gas mileage was atrocious | The Dodge was a '99 with 120K miles and was beginning to need work | We got an internet deal lined up for a Milano Red base 5-sp manual for MSRP and waited a month to get it | So we are now a two Fit family | My Democrat wife gets the Tidewater Blue Fit and with my Republican leanings I get the Milano Red Fit so we are properly color coded | Humor aside these are truly great little cars with a wonderful combination of economy and utility | 
 "words": Bought the Fit to replace a Mazda5 destroyed in a crash And I was worried about downgrading I shouldn't have as the Fit is a fabulous little car to drive | I put LOTS of miles on my cars every year so interior design and comfort are very important to me | The Fits seats are actually some of the best I have sat in ever much to my surprise coming from the Mazda which had chair height seats | This car is NOT underpowered for every day driving I live in the mountains of WV and so far the Fit has zero problems climbing hills in fifth gear | Best of all is an average fuel economy of 40 honest to god MPG for my 70 mile one way commute it doesn't get any better than that | 
 "words": After reading up on the fit for a year or so I decided to buy one in Apr 08 | The gas mileage is great averaging 35 mostly city | I average 33- 35 and when driving mostly freeway I avg 35-38 so a little better than expected and the main reason I purchased the fit | It is very smooth compared to my Nissan Truck-it will depend on what you are used to | I take long trips to DC and Philly-about 500 miles and my right leg cramps up so long trips can be tough if you don't take a lot of breaks I usually only stop twice and for very short periods of time | The 2009 has a arm rest and other improved features recommend waiting supposedly will get over 40 but love the 2008 no regrets |

 "words": Put 600 miles on my Fit just broken in and have no complaints | The handling is superb for an economy car and puts some sports cars to shame | The interior does not feel cheap seats are perfectly shaped fit and finish are typical Honda and the Magic Seats are an excellent feature | Low road noise levels | Gas mileage has been great but a bigger tank would help extend range between fill ups | A C could be stronger especially in 90 degree heat | 
 "words": Great little car when I first saw it I thought it was ugly | It grows on you I really enjoy driving it holds the road nicely and has averaged 37 to 40 mpg | 
 "words": Hi all | We never even drove the fit before buying it | It reminded us of our first new 1977 Honda CVCC and that car was one of the best we ever owned | I picked the car up in the Pittsburgh area and drove it back to Lancaster PA 252 miles | All of the driving was at speeds of 55-70 mph | MPG was 39 and this car had no miles when purchased | I can't believe how quiet this car is | I really was expecting much more road noise | The Fit took all the hills of Western PA without a hitch | Not once did I have to floor it to make it up any hills or to maintain the speed limit | The interior is just flat out perfect | The materials reminded us of our Accord Ex | The handling was perfect | My wife is in love 
 "words": I bought my Honda Fit after my 1997 Chevy Blazer's transmission went | I wanted to get something that had a much better fuel economy and better track record as far as maintenance Honda | I also still wanted to have a vehicle that would allow for cargo in the back | The Honda Fit met all of the criteria | It is so easy to drive and the fuel economy is great remember I drive a Blazer so this is a shock | The only thing that bothers me is the acceleration is delayed and it seems like it races before it kicks into gear | Maybe it's because it a 4cyl and I'm used to a 6cyl | I also have noticed it's worse when you have the AC on | Other than that I love my Fit | I hope to have it for many years | 
 "words": We bought the Fit last fall as a commuter vehicle and have since used it almost exclusively | With gas 4 we now leave our Sienna in the garage except for trips with more than 4 of us | The Fit just took our family of 4 children 6 and 9 and all our gear on a 2 week 4300 mile trip west | It handled the mountains and 75 mph on the interstate just fine and 32 to 41 mpg to boot | The lower economy occurred at 75 mph into a strong head wind | This car drives bigger than it is handles well and the paddle shifters are fun when pushing the car on curvy roads | I'm 6'2 and I was comfortable for all 4300 miles | Sure enjoyed the mp3's across the many miles of fields and cows | 
 "words": This car is the Swiss Army Knife of cars | I have hauled more cargo than my truck has seen | The folding seats great gas mileage and the room inside makes this car a winner | My only complaint is that the windows need tint from the factory | Average mileage is 34 and I have gotten as high as 39 | Handles great and rides good | Long trips are not uncomfortable | Would definitely buy another one | I use the car for commuting to work but now I use it for everything including the long trips | Large cargo space is very handy | 
 "words": The only mechanical problem is the a c does not cool properly | The car has lots of design defects | The buyer is required to accept options whether they want them or not | I don't want electric mirrors door locks or windows | I do not want power steering | There is no leg room for the driver if the seat is moved far enough forward to reach the steering or if the seat is moved back far enough for good leg room the steering is too far from the drivers arms | I do not want side curtain or any other air bags | I absolutely do not want ABS and I will disconnect it | I would have liked variable speed intermittent wipers | Ride is harsh | Interior black color is hard to keep clean | 
 "words": I bought this car coming down from an '02 CR-V and I must say I do not miss it | I have just as much space and functionality with MUCH better gas mileage and just as nice appointments | I love that I can fit there's that word again | my whole family in the car and still have space | I have taken my daughter in a car seat sister her wheelchair her service dog AND a cartload from Costco with two dog beds and no one was cramped | I love having the MP3 jack and the sound is good | My one complaint is that the A C just SUCKS the gas out of the car as well as draining power | If you live in a hot climate consider this carefully |
