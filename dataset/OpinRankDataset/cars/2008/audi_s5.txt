REVIEWS
 "words": What a great car to own and drive | I looked at the new M3 AWD250 335Xi | This is a great daily driver even though Minnesota winters thanks to AWD | Handles great and performs like a dream | Not to mention the downright serene exhaust note | Suspension is firm enough to eat up the turns but soft enough to not leave you bruised upon arrival | Great GT cruiser | Getting MUCH better MPG than the sticker claims even with fairly aggressive driving | BO Sound system is great and a must have add on | Every time I get in this car I'm glad I went with the S5 | A great blend of performance and fun yet supply enough to be a daily driver | Now an Audi convert | past cars MB E5004matic
 "words": Have had my S5 for almost a year | Still love it every time I get in | Great overall experience | This is my 4th Audi A8 2 S4s and now S5 | My favorite overall | Greatly improved fit finish compared to my 2 S4s | Great in snow with high-performance snow tires | I would buy this car again without hesitation | Enjoying it too much to worry about mileage | I didn't get it for the mileage | Still like to just look at it after a year-great design | 
 "words": The Audi S5 is the perfect all-around all weather car | In the time leading up to my purchase I drove the new M3 RS4 A5 and S4 | The S5 is the perfect combination of performance comfort style features and audible pleasure | I loved driving the M3 and was close to deciding on that car but I was a little worried about RWD in the northern Wisconsin winters that can make driving even an AWD car a challenge 6-8 months out of the year | After nearly three weeks with the S5 I can say I am thrilled with all aspects of the Audi | I disagree with people on the MPG for a car of this type the MPG is great | I drove 200 highway miles today and got 23mpg | That is up from 19mpg in the 1st 1000miles | 
 "words": So far so great | I traded a 2007 A6 4 | 2 for this S5 I have driven a few cars in the last three months A5 new M3 and my S5 | The S5 is the perfect blend of performance comfort style quality and all weather security | I really liked the M3 but was nervous about the Wisconsin winters and RWD | Then I saw the S5 in person drove it and fell in love | 
 "words": Took delivery back in late jan 2008 | Have logged close to 2500 miles in mixed driving | Car handles phenomenally and is a head turner wherever I go | Build quality is impeccable interior design and exterior styling make this one unique car | Also looked at the 335xi but the audi interior was more aesthetically pleasing this layout is very driver centric | Although the car is heavy handling is precise and the car feels like it's on rails especially in the twisties where it simply attacks the corners | Biggest downside is the v8 gas gulper but the car is such a joy to drive that the sub par gas mileage becomes bearable | 
 "words": I have had my Audi for about 3 weeks and have had many positive comments about the car | I will say this is my first Audi but I am overall a lover of cars owning everything from SUV's to American Muscle cars to Japanese rides such as the G-35 coupe | Positives-The S5 is an excellent ride not too rough for a sports car ergonomics are great V-8 is very responsive in all gears | Day time running lights turn countless heads | I-pod integration a must | Spacious trunk | Tight handling | Negatives- electronic speed limited | No voice activated Bluetooth | Horrible gas mileage | No standard all season high performance tires | 
 "words": The bluetooth may bring some connection headaches | but it's a hell of a machine | Key functions may also not be as well connected | Nonetheless very comfortable and extremely smooth in gear shifting | It has an awesome shape and look to it | The base is low so parking and going thru dips may scratch the front bottom bumper
 "words": I live in the Chicago area so my initial concerns were a what do I do if it snows and b the gas mileage ain't pretty | As for the snow of which we saw a near record amount this year the S5 drives exceptionally well | I dumped the summer performance tires within hours of picking up the car replacing them with high performance all seasons | The car's power is so easy that driving slow in rough conditions is easy | The gas mileage is terrible | 
 "words": This is my third Audi and by far the most fun to drive | I've owned a 2000 A4 2 | 8 Avant and 2006 A3 2 | 0T and this upholds the Audi reputation for excellent interiors and beautiful exterior design | This car is beautiful by looks and in driving | The growl of the V8 had me from the start but sitting inside you get to appreciate the attention to car-driver intuitive design | The six-speed manual has a nice feel but 1st can be a bit abrupt but it's a bit new so too early to judge | Gas mileage is a definite concern 12-22mpg but only time will tell | 
 "words": To be a first time Audi owner with a 2008 S5 is the best car experience I've ever had | The car is absolutely stunning from any angle and light setting | I have soccer moms looking at the car at stop lights | Not very easy to get used to I might add | The performance and V8 sound more than equal its stunning looks | Interior Fit and Finish are Audi's best and the MMI is easy to use and informational | The Bang Olufsen stereo is amazing but its usually muted since I love hearing the V8 engine noises inside the cabin and also with the windows down | 
 "words": This is my 17th car following just about everything but Audi Porsche 928 and 996 Turbo SL500 BMW 735 and assorted Ford and Chevy cars | Hands down this is the best automotive execution I have driven | I'm a nut for picking apart failed user interfaces my job and this car has not disappointed me however I'm only about 75 familiar with it after 400 miles | MMI is a bit complicated so the Driver Information System and steering wheel controls are fabulous | you can do 90 of what you need very quickly intuitively and with eyes forward | IPod integration including playlist support is great and will save lives | The motor and drivetrain is wonderful | 
 "words": Being the 1st review means I haven't had it long enough to really have good answer to some question | Went in for an A6 R6 was shown this one and only by a friend and 5 min later it was mine | This car is as nice to drive and it is to look at | The DI V8 has such a unique sound at first I though there was a miss but it's growing on me | Waiting for more mileage to go stand on it | Quick checks tell me that MPG is 22 if your on the road | This is a 6 speed and love the way it shifts | If I had the option I would have got the automatic but would have to wait for 4-5 months and maybe not in a S5 | 
 "words": Until recently I have owned and driven BMWs the most recent being a 330 xi | That was the last Bimmer I will ever buy Audi has converted me to a loyal and longterm fan | I have been curious of Audi as a brand for some time and the look of the new S5 was what it took to get me to go and have a closer look | Wow |
