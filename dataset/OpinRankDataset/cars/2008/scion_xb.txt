 "words": I was looking around for another car last august and saw this one online and fell in love | I got it within 2 weeks | I got the 5 | 0 RLS Series Gold Rush Mica Edition with the color matching interior and I love it | I love the CVT Transmission though I wanted a Manual | It has more power then a lot of people would think-150HP in a 4cyl ain't bad | I have no complaints about it so far | Got it used though it looked new with only 3500 miles and now with 12 600 it still runs like new | I'm only getting 23MPG City which I wish was a bit better but for the size of the vehicle I can't complain | 
 "words": Easy in and out | Power increase that was worth the 3-4 mpg difference | Easy to drve and to fall in love with | Center guages easy to view with out looking down and taking eyes off of road | This maks a different on long trips | Other seem to give me a headache now | Ride is just about right not too soft not too hard | 
 "words": I love my scion xb | I am happy with just over 24 mpg in town driving and over 30 on the interstate | I was unsure at first but quickly fell in love with this car |

 "words": I now have over 30000 miles on this car in just over a year and I love it more every day | I did have a wheel sensor that went bad but dealer fixed it no problem | This is my second scion and as long as they make car that fit my needs I will be a customer for life | For the first 10 months I was only averaging about 24mpg but just like with my first Scion once I got towards 30000 miles I am now averaging 29mpg and I do a lot of around town driving | 
 "words": The xB may be the best kept secret of the year | Mine is an awesome conveyance this from someone who has owned about 30 vehicles and did for over 25 years drive over 40K miles per year | As with my '94 Previa AWD van that has 260K and still runs well my xB is no disappointment when it comes to reliabilitynot a single problem yetand now that it has 20K and the engine has settled in I just observed over 30 MPG only got about 25 whthru the Mt | s of WV and the hills of VA PA this with over 500 lbs of luggage demo gear plus my 230 wt | It has plenty of acceleration and although suspension could be stiffer I could cure that for a few hundred in factory add-ons it's fine as is | 
 "words": I've had my xB for four months and love it | You get so much car and so much safety for just 16200 | Yes it's heavier and less fuel efficient than the old xB but I can drive my wife and three kids in this xB with both peace of mind and some zip | I think Scion has somewhat mis-marketed the vehicle | It's a great family car notwithstanding its looks | The side airbags VSC and traction control four-wheel disc brakes 2 | 4L engine and that extra weight make it a smart adult car | I drove the Honda Fit and the xD before the xB and noticed the huge difference in weightpower and ride immediately | The xB is an incredibly safe roomy and practical car one more families should consider | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle | I have put about 400 miles on it so far and have been really pleased with my purchase | The ride is a little bumpy but going from a giant F-150 might explain the sensitivity | I love the center mounted gauges and the trip computer is so convenient | It gets kind of annoying having to switch between the clock and the other information on the trip computer but for 17k I can push the button a couple times | The upgraded stereo is a must | It looks a whole lot better and allows for future sound expansion if desired | All in all I'd highly recommend this car for all people of all ages | I'm 26 and my Dad much older wants one now | MUCH better than the Honda Fit etc
 "words": After having a 2005 xB I decided on a whim to go check out the 2008 xB | Right when I stepped inside this car I was sold | I took a test drive and I had made my decision on the manual | I have now have 4000 miles on my new xB and would never go back to the old xB | I can't think of anything better on the old xB except for the gas mileage but I was willing to sacrifice that for more power | The new xB does not feel like a tin can like the older models and it is an all around safer vehicle with standard side curtain airbags | Ride is much smoother especially in high winds and quieter | I live in Colorado and it handles well in the snow with the stability traction control and standard ABS | 
 "words": I have gone 1800 miles so far and am averaging just over 32 miles a gallon | Those getting less must have a lead foot | Car is better than expected and glad I did not get the Fit Maxima or Versa which I test drove | The safety features in this car are great | 
 "words": This is my second xbox | I love it so far | Toyota has out done themselves in the improvements to this car | I had an 06 that was recently totalled and I actually really liked that vehicle | But this is a whole new car | 1L bigger engine almost 40 more HP 4 wheel disk brake cruise control ipod mps hookup side air bags more comfortable interior seats sports stick automatic etc | All the extras for a minimal increase in price | I highly recommend this car | Very affordable fun to drive great gas mileage and best of all horsepower | 
 "words": Everything is great on this car the only thing that I regret is not getting the entertainment system put into it I wish that I would have gotten the GPS navigation system and the flatscreen seat monitors for the back seats | I only have one problem and that is the FM tuner it makes distinct clicking and static noises every once and a while I took it back to the dealer and they said that all 08 scion xBs do that and that i should call the corporate office and file a case if I want it fixed | 
 "words": For the last seven years I've been driving a 1995 BMW 325is coupe | Although I loved the car repair bills two-door limitations and so-so gas mileage got me looking at a new car under warranty | After much research I was ready to buy a Honda Fit | Then I noticed the Toyota xD was getting rave reviews and from there found the xB | For about 2000 more than the Honda Fit the xB delivers nice hp great room and functionality and a whole lot more style | We got black and my wife says it looks like a hearse | I think it has a 1940s' gangster car look | But we both love it | 
 "words": Fantastic car for transporting elderly parent | They can get in and out without stepping up or down to get in and out of the Scion xB | I am also a tall person and this was the one car I can sit up in with out having to lean the seat back | A good value | 
 "words": I am more than impressed after 2 months of quality time with my new 2008 xB | I highly recommend the rear sway bar as you can take a corner with a 60000 sports car believe me I've done it | The ride is smooth and quiet and the new Camry 4 cylinder engine gives the 2008 xB a good boost of power when needed | Add in sports stick on the automatic transmission iPod MP3 standard Pioneer deck and a 50s gangster wagon exterior and the 2008 xB is in a class of it's own | 
 "words": I went from an F150 SuperCrew to this car | Major downsize but I still fit very comfortably in this car | I've had for it a couple weeks and the average mileage has crept up to 27mpg | This is very functional and fun car | 
 "words": I've only put a couple hundred miles on the car but I thought I would offer an initial review | I will come back and do another one after a couple thousand miles | Any way the Scion xB meets my needs very well | Some people keep comparing it to the old xB and saying it gets bad mpg and its not unique anymore | Well in my opinion the new xB is a better car | It takes the highways better and as well as the city | The mpg are not bad at all I've been averaging 29 MPG and that's 99 city | It's got a great interior with lots of leg room for both the front and back and I can haul all my stuff | I traded in from an very large V8 Chevy 4x4 truck | Get one you'll be glad | Its fun frugal cool
 "words": This is a great little car | Not only is it fun to drive I have the 5 speed manual but I get looks everywhere I go | And it's so big inside | Tons of room | I only have 675 miles on it so far but have averaged 27 | 5 miles per gallon in mixed city hwy driving which is a far cry from the 10-12 MPG I was getting in my F150 | Build quality is better than I've seen in other cars in its price range and I looked at a lot before I drove this one | If you're looking for a lower priced gas sipping fun to drive car you should really check out the Scion xB | You'll love it | 
 "words": This car is simply said as Well Built | I love the overall package | My vehicle is white | I placed after-market 20 chrome rims | My ride is a definite eye catcher | Riding on rims will always make a little more noise over stock rims | But it is small sacrifice for large rewards | And best of all it's a Toyota | Another one for the good guys | Enough said | 
 "words": What a trill to drive | The Nypnotic Teal Mica gets many stares particularly with the black and polished aluminum wheels that I added immediately | I travel frequently for long distances so having cruise control is a ticket saver | I discovered that you can be doing 80 mhp and not realize it | One of the main reasons for my decision to purchase the 08 xB was the ability to make it a very personal vehicle its hard to beat the value for your dollar ratio | Shape weight and power were my second reasons | 
 "words": I bought my first Scion a couple of weeks ago and I still go out in the garage just to look at it | It is so cool | I am a musician and it has lots of space for instruments and sound equipment with the rear seats folded flat | I travel on the highway a lot and the comfort factor is a 10 for me | You sit up high and you have panoramic view out the front windows | Everyone comments on how much room there is inside | I have the nautical blue and it is beautiful in the sunshine | I have purchased a cargo bag for the back so my groceries stay contained | I love the MP3 connection and the pioneer stereo | Mine has the spoiler too | It feels very safe on the highway and very cozy to drive | Buy one | 
 "words": I own a 2002 Mercedes S500 a 2007 Lexus Es 350 and drive my new Xbox 75 miles each way from West Palm Beach to Miami 5 days a week | Man this car is fantastic | I test drove the BMW 5 series 3 series Toyota Camry and E350 and just noticed the xB by accident while at a Toyota dealership | I liked the automatic but when I tried the 5 speed manual that was it | saved a ton of money | It is fun to drive reliable and can use regular unleaded | 
 "words": My 08 Scion xB was the first vehicle I have ever bought new | I love the style of the vehicle | I wish it got a little better gas mileage though I am avg like 25 mpg | And what's up with the 2 inch wide armrest | That thing is ridiculous | And at least put one on the passenger side too | Other than that I love it | This is the first car I have driven where I could feel the transmission down shift when slowing down | 
 "words": I traded in a 2008 Toyota Corolla for a 2008 xB | The only thing I miss is the fuel economy 35 vs | 28 on xB highway | But the Scion has a lot more room and comes with more standard features like curtain airbags for rear passengers which I required for my 3 and 6 y o boys VSC and ABS | The stereo sounds great unique and I still haven't seen another 2008 xB on the road yet | When I get to a place I like to stand out from the rest not possible with the Corolla which is ubiquitous | In the outside the Scion xB is 10 inches shorter than the Corolla and inside it's bigger oh so nice | I love this car | The purchase process was very painless too | 
 "words": When a friend of mine told me to go look at the xB when I was in the market for a small SUV I called him CRAZY | I swore I was not driving a box | Well this box is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned | It has awesome power and handling | Gas mileage is wonderful since I came from a Nissan Titan | I have all the extras like the Pioneer enhanced radio rear spoiler fog lights overhead console illuminated door sills 17 rims and under dash and cupholder neon lights | All this makes my xB even more unique than it already is | It is a great and fun car for the price I would recommend it to anyone | Actually a month after I bought mine my mom bought one too | We are now an xB family | 
 "words": This car has been perfect for my family and golden retriever | After 1200 miles everything is very smooth and still fun to drive | I am getting 26 mpg with big 18x7 | 5 inch rims so I am happy | Went with the teal and I still think its the best color choice available | The dash area is plain but I love all the compartments | They are much more usable with added rubber pads | The drive is a bit noisy on bigger rims wheels but I plan on adding my own sound deadening to the floor | 
 "words": I just traded my 05 xB for the 08 xB I wanted more power and more weight because I drive on the highway most of the time and the other box lacked power | I checked many cars before going for another xB and in all of them I felt claustrophobic no space at all | The new Scion fit my budget and my need for more power | It will take some time to get used to the new model at first I did not like the older xB then I loved it | I am sure this car shape being different will take some time to get used to too | It's way ahead of its time | I love the stance of the car and the price has no comparison with any other brand | For the same specs you need to shell from five to seven thousand more | Enjoy I do | 
 "words": Drove to work parked and returned at noon | Dead battery | Had left the lights on | Jump started and drove to dealer | Service tech checked the lights-on warning buzzer and said | yep it works fine | I have normal hearing for a 71 year old male but the high frequency and the low decibels of the buzzer keeps me from hearing it | Dealer said call the customer satisfaction line | Called was told similar complaints had been received they would be happy to record my complaint and 2009 models might change | I checked other car buzzers and can hear them all | Frequent jumping of the battery can | t be my best option | 
 "words": I recently traded my 03 Camry LE 4 cyl | in for 08 xB | xB's acceleration is similar or better | Suspension is way more firm | I get 27 MPG in the city Chicago suburbs better my Camry | It's smaller outside but it has a lot of room inside | My 11 y | o | son likes it a lot so do his friends | On the road we get a lot of looks from passing cars | Safety features are much better | I like the way the dashboard is configured everything is in the middle | AC heater vents are awesome | they're adjustable all ways | xB doesn | t have a vent for the rear | however my son feels more air coming to the rear seats cause of the configuration of the vents | It | s not as wide so 3 full size people don't fit in the back | 
 "words": When buying the Scion xB I wondered if it might be a mistake on my part because let's face it the Scion name hasn't been around as long as its parent company Toyota | However much like the ugly duckling story I found that once I got used to the boxy looks nowhere near as bad as last year's design I found that I love this little car | I traded in a gas loving 2004 Ford Explorer that I had named slurpy and when I filled the Scion up for the first time I found that my gas cost were going to be cut in half and still getting about the same total mileage out of my tank as I did with my Explorer | My opinion if you can get over the odd looks of the car I highly recommend it | 
 "words": I bought my Scion lasy Saturday and I have to say that I am very Impressed with this vehicle | For the price it is really a great buy and it is fun to drive | Now I make up excuses to go out and drive | With all the accessories for it it really makes it become your very own extension of yourself | I highly recommend anyone to give it a try and test drive one and you will get one for yourself | 
 "words": I am 6'4 and 230 lbs | I am not their normal customer | I am a 43 year old single male who uses this for my business | The fact that I fit in it with extra room it came with many options it gets awesome gas mileage and it's a Toyota made buying it a no brainer | I'd buy it again |

 "words": We had a 2005 xB but it was totaled in a wreck | It crashed well and we decided to go ahead with a new '08 | We like the new safety feature of a side curtain airbag | The ride is smoother the acceleration faster and the noise level has been greatly decreased | My wife and I have both noticed that you have to keep an eye on the speedometer as you can be going 80 and not realize it | We got 30-32 MPG with the '05 but only get 26-28 MPG with the new '08 | It handles well but I occasionally have a problem with the ground clearance | I have to be careful backing out of driveways with a sharp drop off | The cyclops backup light is no brighter than a regular backup light so only half the light | 
 "words": This is a fun car | Just bought my 2008 HB I really like it | Although thought I would get better gas mileage | Great look and it provides the much needed space that smaller cars typically don't | Love it | 
 "words": I have had my xB for about a week | I traded in a 2003 Honda Element when I bought this vehicle | I have to say that the Scion with its upgraded engine seems to be a better car than the Element | More comfortable seats less rattles better handling and better mileage | I think the xB is a good value for the money when you consider expected depreciation good mileage Toyota reliability and cute factor | I think you get a lot of car for the price | 
 "words": I love it | It's the perfect blend of slick unique styling inside and out and urban-living functionality all at a great price with a great engine sound system and tons of cool extras all standard | I traded in my 2003 BSP Toyota Matrix for a 2008 HTM xB | I liked the xB1 but it had too many flaws for me to consider it for my next purchase | Perfect timing for a redesign | Drastically improved exterior interior and under the hood over the previous generation | Still has the unique quirky-but-cool boxy look Toyota reliability low base price extremely well engineered convenience and functionality awesome upgrade Pioneer stereo | The xB possesses that fun-to-drive factor in excess | 
 "words": Love it but C-pillar is 2-feet wide so there's a blindspot which caused me to hit a pole when I backed up | Luckily the bumper was real steel not plastic so damage was minimal and I only needed a new bumper cover and light | 
 "words": I love this car it's everything I was looking for and more | I was driving a Honda Civic before and this car is so much better in every respect handling power room style options ride etc | The only thing I miss is the 31 MPG I got with my old car now I get about 27 90 city | Even so it's worth the tradeoff for all the other great things about this car | 
 "words": It's unique I'll give it that | The fuel economy is a big disappointment not expecting this from a Toyota brand and there's also a substantial amount of road noise | It's really a 'strip' car you have to pay for everything including floor mats | There seems to be some vibration at highway speeds over 60 mph | The upgraded radio 389 doesn't pick up all the stations in my area and there are 2 FM frequencies FM1 and FM2 this is a ripoff | Save your money | Overall it's a good buy for the money | 
 "words": We have owned a Mercedes an Audi numerous Hondas an RX-7 and a MINI Cooper S | This is by far the most practical car we have ever had | It is not a sports car but delivers a comfortable ride gas mileage better than on the sticker and build quality that compares with just about anything priced ten grand higher | If we only had to have one car this would be it | 
 "words": This is my second Scion I traded in my 2005 xB | I loved my first one and I love this one too | I really like the new look |

 "words": Overall the car has good pickup for a 4 cylinder | I am getting 27 | 5 mpg driving 16 miles through 30 stoplights in a major us city | No one can believe the interior room the car has | Went out on a double date and fit 4 adults in the car comfortably | I do suggest upgrading the radio to the second upgrade pioneer if you want to enhance the sound quality in the future | I have added a bazooka subwoofer aftermarket and the audio installers could not believe the quality of stereo that came from the factory | The ride is smooth for a small size vehicle | Overall people like to ask me about the car | Everywhere you go someone will be looking at it wondering what it is | 
 "words": For the money this car is almost perfect | Lots of interior room good but not great performance and improved styling | Fuel mileage could be better | with a 14 gallon tank the cruising range is less than most competitors | The handling is very responsive including stability traction control systems | 
 "words": This is an update from an earlier review | Well I finally had a chance to take the car out to 1200 mile trip to Vegas from northern Cali | Which I had planned so many time with my 06 xB but could not get the nerve to do it | Given that the car was fully loaded with 4 passengers and luggage to the ceiling the ride was comfy power decent and got a very good 27 | 3 MPG running 85 90 of the trip | So over all I am very satisfied with the car | 
 "words": I'm a new owner | I've heard a lot of positive things about the car before | Now I can say that it's true | There's a lot of power handles well and a very practical vehicle | My wife and daughter love it too | 
 "words": I dont know where to begin | This is such a great car | It's super fun to drive and the functionality is superior to other cars in its class | I was set on buying an HHR until I happened upon the Scion | The Scion wins hands down for room | So much leg room in front and back | It easily fits 3 adults comfortably in the back seat | And the price cannot be beat | A great value | I was leery about the blind spot in the cargo area but I have not had any problems | The engine is peppy and gets up and goes when you want it | And another plus is the gas mileage | I have only had the car for a week but so far my average mpg is 30 | that is a combo of city and highway | Try one you will be impressed | 
 "words": This is one awesome urban utility vehicle | As more people discover that Scion finally powered it with the Camry 2 | 4L engine no longer a power plant that could not pull a dead bird off a fence expanded the interior cabin space and polished the exterior lines a bit it should be a huge hit for Scion | Love the black sand pearl paint job looks like a small hearse which fits my probate lawyer profession and personality to a tee | It is certainly a head turner in west central Florida | 3100 pounds really helps the ride and feel surpass a mint 420 SEL I once owned | Europe will have a tough time competing with this ride | 
 "words": This is my first car at 17 almost 18 | Honestly I could not be happier with this ride | I decided to go with the aqua green color Hypnotic Teal Mica and this color car is definitely a head turner | In fact when I was driving my neighbors literally couldn't believe I was driving in this hip car | So after driving the car for about a good 1 2 hour this is what I have to say about it | The car on the outside doesn't look that big but on the inside there is a lot of interior | The thing I like the most about it is just how easy it is to get out and in | Plus the seats are the most comfortable I've ever been in | Feels like they were custom made just for me | The car has a quiet interior very smooth | 
 "words": This car is a great car for the money | Has the same engine as the 2007 Camry and Rav4 base models which are 4k more | Has a lot of extras that a lot of cars in this price range do not have | The back seats have tons of leg room | This is a great car for a small family | 
 "words": Have had the 08 xB for 1 week and I'm still thinking of excuses to hop in and take it for a whirl | Great room comfort and pep | Dig the styling including the center mounted dash | Didn't think I'd like it at first but now all cars should have it | Standard safety features are tops and the mileage is better than the sticker advertises especially for highway driving | Ride could be a little suppler but then again I'm coming from a midsize sedan so it's different | Ignore the reviews about the 'blindspot causing C-pillar | It's not nearly as bad as the reviews say | Much better vehicle than the Fit esp | w the engine power and safety features | 
 "words": I had an 06XB | Loved it when I bought it and then as the year passed on I began to find things I disliked about it | I didn't like the room between me and the passenger the leg room for the passenger or the lack of getting up and going | I traded in my 06 3 days ago and got an 08 | I love it | They fixed everything I didn't like | The ride is so much smoother | 
 "words": I took my new xB up around some nice curves from the Rose Garden to the Arboretum in Portland OR | This baby really rocks around the curves and that 0-30 really helps | The xB is extremely stable staying mostly flat with very little twisting I'd like to see what the rear sway and front strut bars would do | Add a supercharger from TRD and we're talking head-to-head with a 328i that costs 12000 more | Add a TRD CAI and sport muffler and we're talking 'bout beating that German engineering | Replace the OEM speakers though | These things sound bad as in flat | 
 "words": After a careful research of all sedans with a combination of all features safety comfort space design power and fuel economy I bought this wagon which has them all for a price that is far less | It has everything in it | You cannot get a car which has everything in the right combination | Well who cares if it looks like a box | In fact the 2008 XB looks much sportier | An excellent value for the money | 
 "words": We enjoyed our 2004 xB and did not intend to make any changes | We had the opportunity to drive the 2008 Scion xB | It was immediate my wife and I decided we wanted to own it for many reasons | First safety | Side airbags and curtains 4 wheel disc brakes are new in 2008 | While it is heavier than the 2004 the ride is improved handling is improved | Also the longer wheelbase and length help the ride and improved capacity for a load in the back | More interior lights outside temperature readings of mpg etc | are all new and part of the standard package | Have received lots of questions from bystanders inquiring about the car | Looks good Blackberry Crush Metallic color | 
 "words": Car has been great | Roomy and comfortable | Acceleration is good | Sound system is awesome including the iPod connector | 
 "words": I've had my 2008 manual Hypnotic Teal xB for about a week and have already put 700 miles on it | It's a real pleasure to drive and has lots of features and options that would normally be found in a much more expensive car | For a relatively small car it feels huge inside and is very comfortable | I highly recommend upgrading the stock stereo to the Scion navigation system | It's a much better sounding stereo and a great nav system all in one | I'm averaging 27 | 5 mpg at the moment with mostly highway driving | I did a lot of research on the xB Honda Element Toyota Matrix and Dodge Caliber and the xB stood out as the clear winner | I couldn't be more pleased with my choice | 
 "words": The new xB is a very functional vehicle with amazing luggage space with the rear seat down | What else impresses me is the acceleration and the quiet ride | You really do feel isolated driving the xB which makes for a good road trip car | 
 "words": I've had it for a week now and have put on 500 miles | Perfect in every way power torque cool automatic transmission that I can shift manually because my wife wanted auto and I wanted stick | With the sport shift I don't even need Toyota's 30 hp supercharger | Quality is excellent repeat excellent | It corners better more flat than my old '99 Nissan Maxima SE which was rated at | 79g whereas the Scion xB is | 81g and the car magazines say its 0-60 mph is 7 | 5 seconds and 1 4 mile is 16 sec at 90mph which is same as my '99 Nissan Maxima | 
 "words": Recently purchased two 2008 xBs one for me and one for my daugther | We are both very pleased with our new babies | Mine has the optional navigation in it | Hers has the deluxe Pioneer radio with XM | They are both white with automatic transmissions | Cannot believe the amount of stares we are getting from people as we drive | Overall I have only good things to say about the xB but if there were any negatives thus far for me it would be that the gas and brake pedals are a little to close together | 
 "words": I have owned a dark blue xB for 10 days | I really love it | Before this purchase also looked at Toyota Matrix Chrysler PT Cruiser and Chevy HHR | Scion xB is the best among this group of small wagons | I initially targeted a Matrix but its engine is so loud even at the idling speed and its building quality including paint is one tier below the xB | The xB has way many satefy features and sensors than all the other cars | 
 "words": Nice exterior design | Much better than the previous models | Fun to drive | I drive 70 highway and the MPG is about 27 | I think it is good enough | 
 "words": I owned a 2004 xB and it was a great car | The little 1 | 5 just did not have enough power to keep pace for highway driving | The a c was a little weak on a hot Georgia summer day | It didn't turn as sharply as it should | On the 2008 these small problems have been taken care of | What more could you want than a company who listens to their owners | The 2008 has been refined | The price did go up a little but it is well worth it | The 2008 is the big brother who glides with grace | The ride is smoother quieter and the big 18 wheel trucks don't make him shake | Great work of art for Scion | 
 "words": Great car and has all the safety features |
