REVIEWS
 "words": I've had this car for 15 months and 18k miles | It is a fun car and until recently I would recommend it to anyone | I've had a few things go wrong that should never be an issue especially for a Japanese car | Some are minor some are not The plastic battery box cover broke the first time I opened it | The gas cap broke with part of it stuck on the filler tube | The clutch is not working right | Something inside the clutch assembly broke causing poor engagement disengagement of the clutch which is felt as a notchy clicking sensation in the pedal | The actually clutch friction plate is fine this is not an issue due to poor manual driving skills | Stock tires only lasted 17 | 5K | 
 "words": This is my first car and it has met and superseded all my expectations | As all others I love the handling and the acceleration is great | It looks great a lot better than the new 2010 smiley face and ugly tail lights | I have driven 27000 miles in one year and it runs great with no problems | Get a car bra to protect the paint if you drive on highways often otherwise it will surely get chipped | The tires are a bit skittish in wet conditions although was fine in snow and I live New England | 
 "words": I love this car had it for a year and a half now and love to drive | Honestly would've rather the Speed3 but got this instead | For a 4 Cylinder engine this car is built well sounds good and picks up pretty damn fast | 
 "words": Have had my Mazda 3 for 1 | 5 years now | Great turning radius-so fun to drive on country roads | The car has a lot of pep even though on Highways when you really need the acceleration it can be lacking it is only a 4 cylinder I love the design of the car especially the back end | I do not like the way the '10's look at all as they have tinkered with the unique exterior | Overall the car handles great and is fun to drive around the city but good for longer trips too | I tried to save money and buy the base model which was a huge mistake but not mazdas fault | No key fob no power windows no power locks no cruise control no bose etc etc | Next time | 
 "words": I love my Mazda 3 | The interior is well designed | It has many fun features such as rain sensor bose speakers heated leather seat moon roof etc | I still could not believe that I could get mine for less than 20000 with 0 interest | 
 "words": Im writing my review after the thrill of new car ownership has faded | I'm happy with the car in general but there have been a few problems | The brakes are still extremely squeaky even after 7500 miles | The dealer changed the front brake pads but this had no effect | Secondly there is still a noticeable catalytic converter smell if you go to the back of the vehicle after turning it off in the garage | The dealer claims there is a break in period for this | How long I wonder | There is no area for a purse if you choose to use the driver side cup holder | Finally the car handles badly in snow | The small incline to my garage is impossible to manage with even the smallest amount of snow | 
 "words": The 2008 Mazda3 is a typical 4-door sedan with an atypical drivetrain | From the line the car gets decent acceleration easily capable of bypassing the ridiculous Atlanta drivers regardless of type of car from a dead stop | Handling is great with a fantastic turning radius and the great ability to carve corners at speed | Interior design is nice the sound system is very good and there isn't enough road noise to be distracting from a conversation even on the highway | The only real gripe I have is fuel economy but I knew this before I chose to purchase the car | As a 23-year-old professional this car suits my needs without being flashy or expensive | 
 "words": I love this car | It's as stylish as any BMW but your not paying that ridiculous price | I love the energy this car has | It's way too much fun to drive | Handles GREAT | 
 "words": I traded my 3 series BMW for the 08 S-GT Hatchback | Got it loaded with the Bose Audio front Spoiler and the base accessories are mind boggling Xenons Leather Roof Power all around heated seats | It was an outstanding value and now that they changed the body in 2009 I realize what a masterpiece of beauty this body style is | Designed By the Jaguar designer and he did a top notch job I must say | It launches with ease cruises at 90 not even breathing and has the suspension to match | After I hit 30K had the fuel injectors clean'd and the throttle body and after that the car was like new and started giving me an extra 3 mpg on the fwy with more power | Dealer said stop using 91 it worked | 
 "words": I got interested in the new 2010 Mazda 3 but test-drove the car and didn't like the interior or rear-quarter blind spots at all | Got interested in the old-generation leftover '08 and '09 Mazda 3s still on the lot drove one and liked it much better especially on the inside | Made a great deal on a loaded '08 | I think this is the class of the small-Asian-sedan segment more distinctive than the Corolla or Civic and streets ahead of the Sentra in terms of comfort performance and amenities | It's roomy up front not so much in back quick off the line great in the corners and styled like a bargain-basement BMW | Worthy competitor to Jetta at less cost better build quality | 
 "words": Traded my 2002 Miata SE for this car | Wanted an all season car without giving up much handling and fun to drive | Shopped Civic Si WRX Altima Coupe Mazdaspeed 3 and GTI | chose a Mica Copper Red Mazda3s Touring 5M for price fuel mileage premium fuel not required and versatility | Figured I was making a compromise for enconomics sake | My 1st drive was over a winding mountain pass here in Montana and I haven't smiled like that since I got the Miata | Of course it doesn't have the kick in the pants acceleration of a WRX or V-6 Nissan but the handling and transmission is more then up to the task | I'm 6'4 yes I fit in the Miata and found the front seats as comfortable as any I tested | 
 "words": Just purchased pleased with look and interior wish it was a little more comfortable | I am average height 5'10 and is a little crampted | Fuel economy is not bad | I wish it was closer to 32- 35 the I have read about | Average is about 30 mpg | Warranty is ok changed in the last few years I noticed | I am pleased it's a good car smart buy | 
 "words": I did research for a couple years prior to deciding on a Mazda 3 | My mom had owned the 323 and a Protege for as long as they've been around and this Mazda 3 has the same peppy driving feel | It's small but feels so roomy inside | The handling is fantastic and feels like a much pricier sports car especially around the turns | I've only had it for a month but am absolutely in love with it | It's getting around 30 MPG but that's mostly been in the city not highway | If you want a cute sporty car that's fun to drive and an incredible value this won't disappoint | 
 "words": I love my Aurora Blue s touring hatch | I just bought it a couple days ago and feel that it is the best | It is so cute sporty luxurious and fun | Road noise is not an issue and it's quieter with less wind noise than my father's 10 year old avalon that cost more money | It's great on the highway too | The engine makes a satisfying sporty growl | When you press the unlock button twice all doors plus the hatch open | This car beats all of the competition and is the best value for the money
 "words": I was looking for a more fuel efficient vehicle than my Toyota Sequoia | I've always owned Toyotas and test drove the new '09 Matrix | I wasn't impressed with the responsiveness or the overall looks | I test drove the Mazda 3 and was immediately impressed | The 3 has a very sporty look it's comfortable responsive handles well holds the road well in curves and has lots of features standard safety and otherwise | This car has more standard features than the Matrix such as stereo cruise control on the steering wheel and 17 alloy wheels | I sacrificed a little gas mileage between the Matrix 1 | 8L 4 speed and the Mazda 2 | 3L 5 speed but I ended up with a car that's a lot more fun to drive | 
 "words": I was looking for a new car for a long time that had good gas mileage and didnt use super unleaded gas | I wanted a sporty looking car that looked good inside and out | And this car was perfect | I drove other high end cars such as the Audi A4 Volvo S40 and Subaru WRX I personally think that the interior of this car beats all of those car the leather is awesome and it is very comfortable I would recommend this car for any driver young or old | 
 "words": We were looking for a new vehicle with good gas mileage that uses regular fuel has a best of class reliability and some personality | I believe the Mazda3 hits the mark | We have only had the car for about seven weeks | The factory radio had a problem with the volume the bass would cut out at higher levels | Our dealership checked into a possible software glitch and replaced our radio with a brand new corrected unit | My radio works and sounds great now | This is our very first Mazda and we are looking forward to many happy problem free miles | Driving this car makes me smile | I love my little wagon | To all Mazda3 owners you choose a nice car | Zoom Zoom | 
 "words": Overall I am having a great experience driving the Mazda3s GT | It truly does want to zoom-zoom | I love the car | The only negative is that it is hard to read the instrument dials in bright sunshine | I cannot rate the reliability as I bought the car new but I am counting on it lasting many years | 
 "words": I bought the Mazda 3i 4dr 2 | 0 | And it's a great car | Handling is amazing | Ride quality is firm but absorbant | Road noise is also low | Pretty good power | Fuel economy is about 25-28 mpg | good engine | smooth trasmission | Interior is beutiful exterior styling is unique and attractive i pod jack built in | Im 6'2 and fit comfortably except my right leg very close to console | I sold hondas and toyotas this car exceeds both civic and corolla in overall value | This car offers more performance better looks and far better handling for less | Can't beat that | 
 "words": Favorite Features
 "words": Looked at several small cars mainly due to the high fuel prices | The Mazdas always were rated excellent | Also we had a Mazda 323 forever with no problems | After test driving several cars I kept coming back to the Mazda3 | I'm not sure if it's because it looks so good or because it's so much fun to drive | We looked at used ones but they were close to the price of a new one so we bought new | So far we love it | 1st tank calculated 25 | 8 MPG with that being about 60 city driving | 
 "words": Have had mazdas and still own them but like this interior layout | Seats not as comfortable as the older protege but pretty good | Much quieter than the protege | Love the value edition | Homelink mirror works great and got rid of garage door openers from the visor | Wish the fuel economy was better but it gets what it's rated for | Hope this helps
 "words": I love Mazda vehicles to begin with | They are one of the few car manufacturers that actually build 99 of their cars in Japan | The quality shows | I was very skeptical about a 4cyl | engine with an automactic | The 2 | 3L with the 5 speed auto is an absolute blast to drive | The 6 speed Miata was a blast to drive but try commuting 70 miles a day in LA's freeway traffic | The fit and finish is s good as any BMW 3 series and the performance will make you wonder why you need to spend an extra 15K on a Bimmer | I have owned them as well | First thing I did after I had 1500 miles was change the oil to Royal Purple KN oil filter and KN air filter | I know the car doesn't need this | 
 "words": I took my time and test-drove almost every Asian or European car in the small-sedan class but the 3i Touring stood out | Now that I've had it for 3 months and taken one long trip 2000 miles I'm more convinced than ever I made the right choice | The competition's cars are either fun or economical never both | This car is | I've been getting over 30 in the city and over 40 highway up to 44 mpg | Not a fast car but zippy and very nimble | Wow | Absolutely get the stick | The worst problem is road noise but every car this size has it so I guess it's just part of the deal |

 "words": Researched similar vehicles to death but having owned 2000 and 2002 Proteges with no unscheduled maintenance problems the 2008 was a no-brainer | It's fast enough handles as if on rails driver's seat and position are a great fit | Averaging 34 mpg in mixed Spring driving I coast a lot downhill | Owner oil and filter changes are not difficult if you have ramps that are not steeply angled | Trade your premium fuel burners | It would be difficult not to like the value in the Mazda3 |

 "words":  A I researched cars for months drove 1 2 dozen others in the class Nissan Toyota Honda Kia and ended up selling myself on a Mazda3 before I ever drove one | Started out considering larger vehicles but when gas prices shot up once again and my path was clear I commute 60 miles a day and had to consider mileage | When I did test drive my Mazda3 it was clear this was my car only decision left was color | Problem now is that I like it so much I don't want to put big miles on it so fast this was a replacing my 1999 nissan P U which already has over 170000 miles | I've started sharing the commute load between all 3 of my cars so the Mazda3 is in my driveway for years
 "words": The Mazda3 5-speed hatch is a great car to drive good handling and driving dynamics | Designed to compete with the VW Golf Rabbit it offers similar performance and fuel economy out of its 2 | 3L 156 hp engine | The only thing keeping this car from blowing out the competition is fuel economy | The next generation 3 should address these issues |

 "words": Hello to all possible car buyers | If you are looking for a car with style interior and exterior beauty performance and even good gas mileage for under 20000 dollars look no further this is the car you are going to get | Mazda compares this car to the honda civic and toyota corolla | First of all bad comparison the mazda3 surpasses both these cars by far | The mazda3 offers more bang for the buck in every single possible way | You get far more features then both other cars can offer and these features are included standard not for extra money | 22 29 is what they say I've been getting 24 | 5 miles per gallon50 50 streets highway | LOVE the car |

 "words": I purchased the 2008 Mazda3 Sport for my teenage son based on the excellent safety ratings this car received | I purposely chose the S model as side air impact bags were standard | Unfortunately we had the opportunity to test the SRS system in a recent accident which leads me to this review so others are not taken in by the false safety ratings that Mazda publishes | The car suffered significant damage on both passenger side doors and in my case the air bags did not deploy | I suffered serious injuries that could have been prevented if they had | When I called Mazda No | Am | I was told there was no one I could speak with and should persue through a lawyer or my insurance | Beware | 
 "words": I have owned my Mazda 4 Door with hatch Grand Touring sedan for two days and am VERY happy to have chosen it over the Toyota Matrix which although of reputed higher quality was a total drag to drive | The Mazda is zippy smooth and responds quite handily | Of course I won't get quite the mileage but then I'm coming off a 3500 lb | mini-van so I'm still way ahead | I have no complaints at all and recommend this vehicle entirely | If you want a fun yet semi-sophisticated car that's just roomy enough for 4 adults in super comfort and is also incredibly cute this is your vehicle | I got many more features for less money than the Matrix but ended up with a much better and more nimble ride |

 "words":  Overall quite satisfied | However I will say I am not pleased with the silly horn it sounds like it belongs on a small scooter maybe a motorized bicycle | The bird chirping horn does not match the quality of the car | And I can't say I am all that pleased with the heater it takes 15 minutes or better to attain comfort at which time I am usually at my destination freezing from the cold | Also the panic button on the switch fob has a range of about 20 feet | My previous car panic button had a much greater range helping me find where I parked the car on occasion | But as said I am quite pleased with the car | 
 "words": Lots of pluses | Zero issues in 1st 7K mls | List of standard amenities is as long as your arm | Since most the positives are listed in the brochures and Mazda info I'll focus on the stuff they don't tell you | All cars have negatives | Consider if you can tolerate these 1 | factory speakers are horrible | Replaced all 4 with cheapo 26 speakers for a major improvement | 2 | Even understanding that performance uses gas mileage is less than expected 26- 29 mpg | 3 | Stock tires flat spot after sitting and need to warm up before the tiny thumping goes away | Otherwise stock tire performance and noise is fine so far | No need to slow down and brake for corners | That makes it very fun to drive | 
 "words": I never thought I'd write an online review but I simply had to come back and confirm that this car is indeed every bit as good as people say | I needed to get a new car and heavily researched the Mazda3 in addition to the Honda Civic Si Honda Accord Coupe Mitsubishi Lancer Subaru Impreza WRX and BMW 328 | As you can tell price was not so much of a issue for me as getting a car I really liked | I was worried that the Mazda3 was underpowered and too economy i | e | cheap and mundane for my tastes but after driving all of the cars mentioned above I was left with little doubts | Without exaggeration this car drives and handles like a BMW | I could not be happier with the purchase |

 "words": I have owned this Mazda for four months now and have loved every minute of it | This Mazda hatch has it all compared to other economy cars in its class | Superb interior fit and finish European inspired exterior crisp handling and sporty stance | The Zoom-Zoom of this 3 really differentiates it from all others | The 2 | 3L loves to be revved and the manual transmission definitely helps squeeze every ounce of power from the four-banger | I was debating whether or not to get the navigation system but decided against it as is not worth the 1500 price tag because it does not even have the touchscreen like the CX-7 | At the end of the day this car is near perfect for the price at around 20K |
