REVIEWS
 "words": I drive 200 miles round trip a day mostly highway on cruise | My mileage was low until I put about 15000 on the truck but now regularly get 22MPG cruising at 70 with my high being 23 | 9 | I have found that the power is quite good but the VSA system intrudes too much leaving most folks with the impression it doesn't have low end power | If you switch the button off the truck will launch hard indicating Honda should rethink the programming | My biggest beefs are lack of a telescoping wheel that allows one to rest your elbows on the door and console pad without feeling like you're reaching | Seat comfort is misleading | way too hard | I will be the first in line for a new dturbo diesel | 
 "words": I have put on 50000 miles and am extremely satisfied | This truck is well engineered runs flawlessly and has features not found in any other competitor | Mileage is 20 average and the fit and finish are superb | I have had no mechanical issues |

 "words": This is my second Ridgeline | I originally owned a 2006 RTS which I drove for almost 60000 miles | I was going to buy the new 2009 body but with the great deals they offered on the 2008 I opted to get it instead | I was able to get the loaded out leather Navi Moonroof RTL for what I originally paid for the 06 RTS | I was very pleased with the reliability and overall performance of the 06 which is why I decided to buy another one | In 6000 miles the only thing I had fixed was a strut which was under warranty at the time | I drive a lot for a living so comfort is extremely important | I have owned a few trucks over the years and have never had one that drives as well as the Ridgeline | 
 "words": I have had nothing but issues with this truck the first problem showed up the day after I bought it | I have owned my truck for about a year and a half and have had numerous seals replaced included a gas cap | Most recently my brakes | They have frozen up on me and the emergency brake stays on | Neither the dealership or Honda know how to fix they know there is a problem but have told me they can only fix it once I am stranded again | Not looking forward to that | I would never recommend this truck or Honda again I had better luck with Hyundai | 
 "words": I've owned my ridgeline for 9 months now | Test drove the Tundra but wasn't about to drop 32k on something that didn't have all the options I wanted | The RTS model had everything I wanted and needed | Wife loves driving it and handles great in the Seattle area snow and year round rain | Traded in my '05 Civic for this and couldn't be happier | 
 "words": Overall this is the best car truck I have owned and driven for a person who has owned and driven 50 plus cars | It is practical in regard to doing a variety of things really well | It is very solid and safe with 5 star ratings | It tows well with an excellent tranny match | It has good off road ability in the sense that if you are not looking to get stuck you won't | It rides like a car | My only real complaint is that it is short on after market options | 
 "words": Purchased my RTX after coming out of a Honda Odyssey lease | I really enjoy the overall driving experience of this truck | It handles extremely well drives smoothly and is comfortable inside | I love the in-bed trunk and the numerous storage areas inside the cab | The gas mileage is comparable to other mid-size 4x4 trucks so I knew what I was getting into | The engine is powerful but seems to strain just a little when trying to pass with a cab full of people or a load being towed | Love the way the back seats fold up so you can use the flat floor for storage | Don't pass up the Ridgeline because of looks you will regret not test driving this vehicle when comparing the others trucks out there | 
 "words": This was my first time ever buying leasing a import vehicle and so far I have not been that impressed | The Performance is good and it is fun to drive | Driving it in the snow is like a dream | It also tows my medium sized tent trailer very well but that is where the good stuff ends | I find the front seats are not comfortable on long drives and my back ends up very sore | My truck has been to two different dealerships a total of 7 times for tailgate issues and the problem is still not fixed correctly | After a year the driver door seal wore out and had to be replaced | The paint is very soft and scratches very easily so I do not recommend a dark color mine is a dark red | 
 "words": I bought this truck three weeks ago and I love it | It handles and looks great | I like the it drives and the smooth ride more like a car than a pickup | 
 "words": Have had this one year and nearly 15000 miles | This has been all I had expected and more | It drives more like a car than a truck and yet is incredibly spacious and has lots of novel features | It is wide enough to put a mountain bike inside the back putting the seats up without having to take off the front wheel | You can comfortably sit 3 across the back or fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the bed | A lot has been written about this truck so I really will only add that I am more impressed with this truck after owning it for a year than I was when I first bought it | The only negative I can think of is the gas mileage is mediocre | I average 17 but have gotten as high as 22 on the highway | 
 "words": Overall experience has been great | I use my truck as my daily driver throughout Minnesota winters and most of the summer | Handling and ride are excellent for a truck my previous truck was a GMC Sierra and the Honda is better in pretty much every respect other than raw power and towing capacity | Interior design is highly functional but a little drab and goofy in some respects such as the cartoon large interior door pulls | I have towed a race car on a open trailer near 5000 lbs | total hundred of miles with no problems and the truck has plenty of pulling power and stability as a tow vehicle | The bed is pure genius not only for the truck but also for the full 48 width | 
 "words": We have had our truck for about 6 mo and it is great | It is amazing on the snow | My wife is from the south and hates driving our Lexus in the snow but does great with this truck | It handles and rides better than any other truck I test drove Tundra Tacoma F150 Frontier etc | and it gets reasonable mileage for a truck | It has good acceleration and the inbed storage trunk is a stroke of genius | We are very happy with our truck and would highly recc it to others | 
 "words": I have owned Honda Accords for the past 27 years | Last year I bought a new 2008 Honda Ridgeline RTL | I loved the Accords but the Ridgeline is the best of all | I is another superior vehicle which Honda always provides | 
 "words": I traded in my Ford truck and my Dodge Durango thinking I could get the best of both worlds with the Ridgeline | During the first 1K miles so far so good with the exception of mileage | The Ridgeline handles great the AWD grips fine in inclement weather and the interior is comfortable | The storage spaces are very well designed from the sunglass holder to the pull forward center console that reveals additional CD storage to under seat storage in the rear | In terms of complaints the navi system is not worth the extra money | My 200 Garmin is easier to use gives more detailed directions and displays the speed limits which is great on unfamiliar roads | Save the 2K and skip it | 
 "words": Former 04 Nissan Titan considering Toy Tundra but this was more practical | Cheaper what a deal | Fun to drive gave me more space in the garage | Now well have more fun distance to cover at lower cost | 
 "words": I love my Ridgeline but 2 months ago I noticed something with wheels feeling like right front tire was flat | Next week had to have vehicle towed because it wouldn't accelerate | Make a long story short took to Honda 3 times they wouldn't take wheels off would only do road tests | I had to take truck to dealer every night so when it happened again it would be there | They would not check it out unless they actually saw what truck was doing | It ended up being the rear differential that was locking | It only happens in 30 degree or less weather | I live in Charlotte NC it usually doesn't get cold here but it has | So if you experience this locking of wheels you now know what it is | Thanks warranty
 "words": I looked at the Tacoma the Frontier and the Ridgeline | Granted people told me the Ridgeline wasn't a true truck well that's all right with me | Drives like my Accord V6 but with loads of space to haul or tow things | Super comfortable super styling and Honda reliability how can you go wrong | 
 "words": I have 14K on my Ridgeline RTX | Thus far the swing out tailgate latch and the rear seat vent have broken | Otherwise OK | I have towed boats and trailers with no problems | Brakes work well while towing but fuel mileage drops to 10 MPG or less | Shifts a lot even without a trailer very annoying | I think the engine could handle it if the tranny would wait to drop out of high gear | I noticed torque steer when passing it surprised me and made me swerve | Trunk is awesome | Drives and parks like a car | Fuel mileage is only so-so | Averaging 17-18 and 19-20 on hwy | Functionally the truck is great | It's kind of ugly and my buddies make lots of fun but it's really practical and does what I need it to do | 
 "words": I am a former owner of Dodge Ford Nissan and Toyota Trucks | Friends and family tried to steer me towards purchasing a new 08 or 09 Chevy GM Truck with their current low prices | I drove and tried to make a deal on both GM products along with a new F-150 but the sales folks couldn't quite get me to where I wanted to be | The first time I test drove a Ridgeline I knew this was the vehicle for me | I don't require the services of a full size truck so the Honda is the perfect fit for me | I recently took my truck on a road trip consisting of 2000 miles through rain sleet and snow over mountains and through major metro areas | It handled great in the snow | Averaged 19 MPG Hwy | 
 "words": Wow | So much to say so little space | I have been looking and researching this segment for nearly five years | I really wanted a Tacoma but even with the low car sales plaguing the industry Toyota didn't want to play | Honda immediately offered me an incredible deal on this 08 RTS that I didn't need any more incentive- I snatched it up | This is an incredibly smart truck- all space is usable | seats are comfortable even in the back where I was concerned most because this often overlooked space is easiest to get cheapest attention Chevy Colorado | Absolutely the smartest design in this category if you're looking for heavy hauling look to full size trucks | fits me like a glove | LUV IT | 
 "words": I have owned Dodge Dakota Ford F-150 and Chevy none compare to the Ridgeline | This is a great truck it rides great no problems | 247 hp engine plenty of power very nice | 
 "words": I downsized from a Suburban | I really liked the Chevy it was nearly flawless but I got hosed on the resale value | The Honda rides well and seems to be reasonable with regard to fuel economy | I do think Honda could improve a few things | The HomeLink buttons are not lighted can be tough to find at night | Fog-lights should certainly be standard on the RTL | The front passenger seat is heated but only the bottom cushion due to the side-impact airbags | Attention Honda Other manufacturers have figured that out | Give them a call | Also the stereo is good but not the equal of that in the top-of-the line Pilot | Honda truckers like to rock on too | All in all a good vehicle for the | 
 "words": Looked at GMC Ford but went with R'line for Honda quality | With 8000 on the odo wife was run off the road and into a tree by teenaged driver | Bags didn't deploy and no one was hurt but 15000 in front end including frame damages later local dealer's body shop did a superb job getting R'line back on the road | Will have to drive it into the ground now since it has little trade-in value but seems to be back at 100 Have had to replace navi and a heated seat control both under warranty unusual reliability for a Honda | Very comfortable front seats in which to drive especially on highway trips | Rear seat not comfortable for my teenagers and fuel economy no better than a GMC 1500 | 
 "words": After looking at vehicles for two years I made the decision to buy a Ridgeline over a Toyota Tacoma | I have been delighted with all aspects of the truck with the exception of the mileage | Although it is not horrible I would really like to see 25 mpg on the highway | The design features are well thought out and everything is easy to use | Ride comfort is outstanding although cabin noise could be less | I went to a different tire and noise dropped but body insulation improvement needs to be worked on by Honda engineers | I take long trips and also used the truck on a rugged ranch and have no complaints | Online forums often mention the easily scratched bedliner and this is a problem | 
 "words": I looked for a truck for 2 months | From Chevy Avalanche Silverado to a Tundra | I didn't think about the Ridgeline I always said it was a woman's truck as well as it didn't look good | Well after test driving and comparing prices for what I was looking for in a truck the truck I thought was unattractive was what I bought | I love it and it looks good | I traded a Mercedes Benz ML SUV for my Ridgeline to pull my Harley | I've gotten so many compliments on my brand new 2008 White Honda Ridgeline | Go Honda | Oh yeah ladies men love the truck too | 
 "words": My Wife and I bought this because our 2003 Sonoma extended cab proved too small for our needs | After looking at a number of offerings and both of us DRIVING them the Ridgeline stood out as the best handling and it had a trunk | Add the stylish and very comfortable interior two way tailgate AWDand HONDA reliability it was a no brainer | After 15000 miles 3 synthetic oil changes and a KN filter | 19 | 4 in town 25 | 5 highway spirited driving | Prior to these changes we got 15 | 2 in mixed driving | You will use the trunk more than you think | Go give it a look a drive and with end of year pricing a great deal too |

 "words": I'm a truck guy and I was dead set on buying a tundra or f-150 until gas crept up to 4 gallon | So I went to the Toyota dealership set on buying a Tacoma | But the dealership was rude and was not interested in negotiating | That was the best thing that ever happened because the ridge blows the taco away | It's everything I need in a truck plus more | It has the comfort and features of a nice SUV which is great for 90 percent of the driving I do and the utility of a truck for the 10 of the time when I need it | Definite buy I got it at the dealer's cost -4500 Honda incentive | almost 10k off sticker price
