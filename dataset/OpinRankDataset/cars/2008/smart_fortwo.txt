 "words": Got the car three weeks ago and it's been nothing but great fun | It is a little odd handling the transmission is something you have to get used to | I really feel a true 5 speed manual would have been better | Also note that the tire pressure is 29 PSI in the front tires and that the rear tires are 36 PSI | They were all set at 36 PSI and the handling on the highway was poor tracking and that loose front end | Gas mpg has been 37-40 on and off state highways interstate | Also city driving stop and go | Car has only 650 miles and not broken in | The model is the passion coupe in yellow black tridon black interior extra gauges fog lights | 
 "words": Yes this car will get you attention but once this fad wears out it will be nothing but a joke | After driving this car for 4k miles I have gotten mixed reviews some laughs and some positive remarks | I average 31 MPG but when I drive on the highway at 70 MPH it drops to about 26 and it has zero power for passing | The transmission shifts very hard and abruptly from 1st to 2nd gear | The ride is rough but it is fun to drive a small car | The 2 year warranty is a joke | Every trip to the dealer costs 100 just to look at the car | As I said the car is fun to drive for a few weeks but exhausting to own and no worth buying if you need a reliable fuel efficient car | A Honda Fit is a better value |

 "words": The SMART is not the best car for some but if you understand what it offers it may be the perfect car for you | It delivers great gas mileage fits two tall people very comfortably can be easily towed behind an RV and is a great around town car | Don't buy the smart if you are expecting the manual transmission it comes with to shift smoothly it is not an automatic but a manual that can be driven in automated mode | It shifts just fine if you drive it in manual mode | If you are a baby boomer with no kids at home or someone looking for an around town car to go to work or run down to the grocery store or even to commute a reasonable distance to work this may be your car |
