REVIEWS
 "words": When you buy a C 300or a 328 or A4 you're buying a good German engineered automobile that delivers sporty and capable driving dynamics without being a performance car enough features to please most drivers but no luxury amenities unless you add optionals that will shoot up the price and comprehensive maintenance service every 10k miles or so | It's a very good car that makes me look forward to the E550 or E63 AMG | 
 "words": I was cross-shopping BMW 335i and Audi S4 | When I drove the C350 I knew this was the car for me | Sure it's not as fast as either the 335 or S4 but overall it is perfect | Mine has the P2 package Multimedia package Panarama sunroof 18 rims and iPod adapter | There are more audio storage options than I could probably ever fill | The stereo is great and the build quality is fantastic | I love driving this car and everything about it | I have no regrets and do not miss having a BMW | I will keep this car for a long time | Drive it you won't be disappointed | 
 "words": I have to say that I didn't know what to expect but I am so pleased that I chose a Mercedes this time around | I normally drive Nissan Maxima but have been very displeased with its stability and maneuverability drove like truck | I heard how fun it was to drive a C-Class so I test drove the 2008 when they came out and was blown away | Great pickup and the steering is awesome | I'm a bit of a speedaholic so this car works for me for its safety features as well | 
 "words": This is the 1st car I purchased for myself | I can truly call it my own | It was the first of the small luxury sedans I test drove and none of the others could live up to the MB C300 | It is a gorgeous car both inside and out | Had MB not redesigned it would not have even been a consideration | I'd be driving a Lexus right now | The car is gorgeous has been reliable for me and the service at my dealership is beyond excellent | I only have good things to say | Nothing says class luxury and comfort like a Mercedes | 
 "words": Great car | amazing exterior | turn heads all the time | Great drive and it is a lot of fun to go over 100 mph until the police stops you | 
 "words": Had dealer install front of car as in the picture | They did it at no cost to me | Have owned many Benz's in my life and this may rank second to a 1972 280SE that I restored and sold to a private party | Love the new amenities and the overall beauty of this auto | 
 "words": Looks looks looks | That's what the new C350 has going for it | I love the AMG styling handling and sportiness | Sometimes the suspension beats you up on PA potholes but I'm used to driving a heavier car | It's lightening fast too | MPG is a bit low for a car but performance makes up for it | Wish the interior was just a bit more posh vs | functional but the new NAV is leaps and bounds ahead of old MB designs | Overall I would recommend this car | It's a Mercedes and surprisingly affordable vs the competition | Go for it | Palladium Silver is a beautiful color | 
 "words": I have driven several luxury sedans and SUVs | If you are in the market to buy a high-bred trust me when I say that this is not a luxury car | It is peppy enough considering what it is | It feels like nothing more than a VW Jetta | The interior is very plain and honestly kind of feels cheap | There is literally what looks and feels like aluminum on the doors and dash | Yes I understand that for 30K you can't expect to get much from MBenz | The car is cute and most likely reliable in the long term but that's about it | 
 "words": Like every few years it was time for me to upgrade my ride to the newest 330Ci BMW | 20 year 3 series BMW driver Not this time After I hear the price and did a over all comparo with my new C350 MB | I can tell you guys that I made one of the best choices of my life | I am not even looking back | My MB gives me so much more features and options that would be extra in a BMW | Performance is not bad at all either Also my experience at the MB dealership was so much better than at the new Snobby BMW dealer here in big D | I still can't believe I am writing a review praising the goodness of my former rival | I am so glad that I finally found The Ultimate Driving Machine after 20 years | 
 "words": I am approaching my one year anniversary and love the car | I liked the interior of the luxury model so I bought it and the dealer installed a sports grille the cost was nominal as the grilles are interchangable | I have had no problems at all | I have 4- matic and the car runs like a tank through the snow | The media center is easy to use and the premium sound is great | The Bluetooth was not compatible with my LG phone so had to buy a Motorola | The seats are comfortable and the MB Tek looks like real leather | A great car for the money |

 "words": I love my C300 Luxury | However I purchased the multimedia package and iPod interface | I sadly discovered the iPod cannot be controlled using the COMAND system and display on the popup screen | Instead you must use steering wheel controls | For a large music collection this is completely cumbersome at the least and it renders the multimedia COMAND controls completely useless | It would be easier to use a traditional patch cable and plug the iPod in to the AUX jack in the glovebox | This is really a bad design and I would think a car stickering at 40K would do a better job | This is my only beef with my new car |

 "words": Best feature is the distinct design change between the sport and lux | Looks like a full size sedan compared to the previous C-Class the Civic looked bigger | Rear seat room is equal to that of the E-Class | Lacks in power and gas mileage | but hey its a Mercedes | If I wanted power I would wait for the AMG to tear the asphalt up | and gas | comon' | who am I kidding | It's a Mercedes I didn't buy it for fuel economy | Looks like a 50k car I highly recommend the AMG 18 wheel upgrade | 
 "words": Put 1000 miles on it so far | Had for one week | Red on black is very sporty and looks great plus is very fun to drive | For a 4 hour trip worked great and comfortable for 3 tall adults and 1 labrador | Everyone stops and looks | Highly recommended |

 "words": Not as luxurious at the Infiniti G not as sporty as the BMW 3 series and not as reliable as the IS350 | Purchased it because it was priced the best out of all 3 | The other 3 cars had too much power and were too expensive | This car isn't on par with the other 3 but you get what you pay for |

 "words": I couldn't wait to get this car when it first came out | I test drove the BMW 3 series a few times before I made my decision to get the Benz | There is nothing like seeing the emblem on the hood of the car when you are driving down the highway | I have not had any issues with this car and the gas mileage is great | The service a A as well | 
 "words": Looking at the price performance ratio in this catogory of the cars this is by far and large the best | Yes it is trace less in terms of the power from the other competitors but is way ahead in all other departments so overall is a sure winner and of course it's a three point star you know what it means | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle | I have only had it a short period of time but love driving the car | My biggest complaint is that the navigatioin system I paid good money for is the worst nav system I have ever used | If you don't have an address of where you want to go forget finding it with the nav system | Search features are horrible at best | You are limited to one voice for directions where others offer several voices | The nav system will override what you are trying to input most of the time and will prevent you from typing in the name of a street you are trying to navigate to | Simply put the nav system is junk | Do yourself a favor and buy a Garmin | The car is great otherwise | 
 "words": First car I've owned that didn't need to go back to the dealership for things going wrong | A very solid well planted highway car | We had a 06 Lexus GS300 before the MB and even though the Lexus had a better ride and fuel economy than the C300 there's no comparison to the handling and feel on the road | The Lexus was like driving your father's Buick | We love this car and enjoy every minute we have in it | Can't wait to try it in the snow |

 "words": Traded in my 2006 Acura TL for the Sport 300 C -4MATIC about one month ago and I'm now happier | The car is much more impressive and looks like it costs considerably more than the Acura | Handling in the snow and rain is superb in contrast to the Acura's scary handling in wet stuff | Three Series BMW'sRWD are also scary unless you get AWD but the cost escalates and is considerably more than the C class | I don't like the looks of the Infinity G nor the Lexus thus the MB decision | The 228 HP | engine is fast enough and responsive the trunk is fine especially with the fold down seatsfits 3 golf bagsthe pop up Nav screen and the Harmon K | audio are neat conversation items | 
 "words": I have owned 3 mercedes C series and this is by far the best to date | My wife and I were going to be practical so we looked at the Accord and Camry | By the time you put everything in them that comes standard in the C300 you are over 30k | It makes it no brainer then to buy the C class | 
 "words": The ride performance and quality are very close to the Edmunds review | The change from a full size SUV to the C300 was a major concern as I am over 6'3 | As it turns out I am confortable in the C300 with some legroom to spare | However I don't think many people could sit in the back behind me as the leg room is quite limited | The mpg savings will off-set the slight increase in payments | This is probably one of the best vehicles that I have owned | I highly recommend the C300 | 
 "words": First time owner of a Mercedes | Engine and transmission very smooth | Nice handling | Lots of standard features including safety features | Very fast in breaking | Took car to almost 130 yeah crazy me | Car felt very smooth can't feel the speed | I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal I'm doing 90 | Only 1 complaint you feel the bumps too hard | Needs improvement on suspension | Yes it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model but you sure feel those bumps | I've taken few pounds off pressure of the tires to releave this problem much beter however my check pressure keeps coming up | 
 "words": I just got into my first Mercedes and I love the car except for the fuel mileage no matter what I do or how I drive I can not seem to get better than 17MPG which I think is horrible seeing that I went from a diesel F250 that got 19MPG | Other than the mileage the car is terrific very nice ride
 "words": I really like this car | It came with pkg | 2 and the communication pkg plus iPod connection | Prior to this I owned a 2003 BMW 325xi | The Benz offers a larger smoother ride and looks sharp | I've driven 1000 miles and like it more and more each day | 
 "words": We own this car now for 3 months and this is our 4th Benz 240D ML320 CLK430 | The difference between my old CLK 430 to the new C300 is quite dramatic and a very nice upgrade | I'm 6 | 4 ft tall in my 40's and this car fits me perfect | Seats are very comfy steering and just driving it is a lot of fun | While I do miss my V8 the car has enough power for everydays driving and I have to say it's quite quick on the freeway | Now my wife wants to drive it all the time and I have to drive our old car | 
 "words": This is a car that I purchased for my wife who had been driving a 2002 Audi A6 | I realize this car is smaller and not designed to compete with the A6 even the older 2002 Audi A6 however things that she and I both notice everytime we drive it on the highway is the wind noise emulating from the winshield | In snow we have 4Matic it doesn't handle like the Quatro A6 she'd grown to love | not even close | the back seat room is limited to children no way 4 adults will be comfortable on a trip in this car | Lastly the dash she has the pop up nav screen version too lacks style | it looks american and is outclassed by the new Cadillac CTS that it competes with | that's a first | 
 "words": I was not too sure on this vehicle or the BMW 328 | Once I found out that Mercedes eliminated Chrysler from producing their vehicles I felt much better | My vehicle was produced in Stuttgart Germany which is great and this first run of C class vehicles were produced their also | If you wait too long you will get South African models which would make me guess on the labor quality | The ride is smooth and the acceleration is quick | The navigation and 12 speaker Harmon Kardon 7 | 1 audio is top notch | This is an all around great car with much more prestige than a BMW | Great job Mercedes | 
 "words": I waited many years to buy a Benz | It was well worth the wait | The car is smooth has great features power and comfort | On a country rooad it drives itself | best value for the money | 
 "words": I have only owned this car for 6 weeks but so far the experience has been fantastic | It is truly beautiful to look at smooth to drive and once you master the COMAND sterio GPS phone system it is a technological marvel | Comfortable and elegant inside and out | I look forward to the coming years of reliable service |
