REVIEWS
 "words": the gas mileage was disappointing | The Spectra stared to fall apart in a year | the service department was horrible | I was hoping it would hold up and the dealership would honor the warranty but after taking it in three times for the door on the gas cap they said it was a poor design and only cleaned it again | and were so rude | they said I must have broken it and the seat belt that wouldn't retract | the side door wouldn't always close | and I always smelt something burning | I wasn't planning to sell it in a year after buying new but lost confidence in this car and the warranty | it is very top heavy and not a good car to drive in the real world | I took a huge loss with Kia | 
 "words": I bought this car in February and since then have already put over 7000 miles on it | I drive a lot | I've never gotten worse than 27 mpg and have gotten as good as 38 and trust me I don't drive like an old woman and that's usually with the AC on too | Was planning on buying an American car but after endless test drives this car had more get up and go compared to Pontiac Vibe Dodge Caliber | I also liked it better than the Nissan Versa way over priced and the Toyota Matrix also way over priced | All in all It's been a great car got more options for less money and it doesn't look like a pregnant roller skate | 
 "words": i have owned 2 kias besides this one and once again kia has surprised me with their great cars they manufacture | i have been a long time kia owner and that is not going to change i drive alot usually 25000 miles a year | and the kias hold up just fine | and i love their basic yet stylish designs and layouts | 
 "words": I do enjoy by Kia | I got it with 12 miles on it in May 08 | I don't drive it very much just to work | But I've had it in the shop 3 time | My kia is a manual and I think thats the problem | the 1st 2 times it was in the shop was 4 months after I got it | It would not go into reverse | Well a new transmission and cluch later the service department said it was Fixed | WRONG at 11months old sure enough its doing it again so i take it to the delership and they say nothing is wrong | Am I the only person having trouble | 
 "words": Overall the vehicle has done what I needed and expected | Power is fine mileage was about 30-31 mpg until I reached 25000 miles then I tipped 38mpg a few times depending upon passenger content and city highway percentage of driving when tracking the mpg of a tank of fuel | Sound system is good with nice bass and crisp highs | My tires wore out at 27000 miles to the wear bars even though I kept pressure monitored closely and rotated according to recommendations but you know how the new car new tires are worse mileage than the ones you replace them with | The only thing would keep me from another spectra purchase is the timing belt has terrible moaning noise in the engine | Dlr says its fine | 
 "words": If you use the stereo aux with a satellite radio or charging ipod there is a very noticeable alternator whine | The dealer had it twice now claims that's the way it's supposed to work | If you are going to have a convenience feature it should work properly | As annoying as this is the real clincher is that the parking lights will go on by themselves in the middle of the night for no reason draining the battery | I'm not the only one with this | Search Kia forums and you will find many with the same issue | Kia claims a new BCM will fix it but it hasn't corrected mine | Then there's the goofy shift points but there's not enough room to list all of my complaints | Dealer is awful too | 
 "words": I purchased the Spectra5 for gas mileage reasons and it was a cute car | It was great for the first 4 | 5 months consistently 30 to 35mpg and the car was so quiet stopped or running | After that I get 15 to 20mpg with no changes to driving habits route traveled or where gas purchased and the car is a lot louder | Service dept blames it on weather car breaking in or just say they don't know and no attempt to look it over | It started at the end of summer before cold started | Make sure that you buy from a dealer that cares | I should have kept my SVU same gas mileage and no car payment | 
 "words": I bought this car because the combination of reviews price and fuel economy were hard to beat and it has exceeded my expectations | Great fun to drive and I rarely get less than 30-32 MPG | Have gotten as much as 35 pretty regularly | My only complaint is that it could use a few more little storage compartments and I miss having the temperature and compass feature that I had in my last car | 
 "words": Well I owned this car for 11 months and totaled it a couple weeks ago | Overall I enjoyed the Spectra5 and it did pretty well with a rear collision at 50 mph | Pushed me into another car so both the front and back ends got it but neither crumpled that far | Safety-wise it did pretty good | The driver seat during the collision slid to the back and put me into a reclining position | Strange but not a serious fault in my opinion | So good on safety brakes stopped me but the Civic behind me | not so much | 
 "words": Bought car 6 mo | ago had this problem since I bought car dealer said if it doesn't happen all the time they couldn't fix it | That was fine in the summer but when I had to have it jumped 3 times in the parking lot at work in -10 that's a problem | Brought it back still wouldn't fix it | Car is 6 mo | old 13000 miles lost 6 grand in value | My mpg were 24-33 thats terrible | My folks' big Buick gets 30 and it's a nice ride not like this | 
 "words": I love driving this car | I laugh at matrix owners knowing they paid thousands more and I have a safer ride | I was worried if Kia's quality was where it should be but after owning it I can say it's better than most | Far better than the american car I own | 
 "words": Bought new last summer | Great build quality and materials especially at this price | Have previously owned 8 Hondas and 2 Mazdas and this Spectra easily compares to them | My EX w manual transmission has averaged 31 in mixed driving 65 35 city hwy well over the 23 30 EPA rating | Shopped the '08 Civic Mazda3 Corolla Elantra and Cobalt | 
 "words": I originally bought a Spectra in 2004 and really like it | I never had a problem with it until the day an SUV coming at me in the opposite lane was hit by a car that ran a stop sign lost control came into my lane and wiped me out | My Spectra was totaled | Although I was happy with my Spectra I went to CarMax to see what else was out there | I drove a half a dozen cars or so and nothing was better than what I had | I purchased another Spectra and have been very happy with it | I must have gotten a good one because I routinely get just over 40 miles to the gal | The comment I get most when people get in my car is This is a KIA | in an unbelieving tone | 
 "words": Perfect for my purposes | Lots of city driving with the occasional cross country drive | I was blown away when I drove almost 500 miles at about 75mph before needing gas | The roomy interior is perfect as I often have a full car | Safety is a huge issue for me and I always feel good in this car | ABS served me well while driving through N | E | snowstorms | The cruise control is great too | Drives very smoothly and the CD changer and iPod hookup are great for long drives | I love being able to have my GPS cell phone charger and iPod all plugged in at the same time | I have had this car for 4 months and have received tons of compliments | 
 "words": The Spectra5 is a very fun spunky car that can't quite out-accelerate other like makes at higher speeds it dominates | Turning and cornering is exceptional sound system is lacking in quality but replacing the door speakers makes a world of difference | Controls are very functional and convenient construction is solid | After market accessories are limited but that's to be expected with a new vehicle | Not fond of the fact that the glovebox doesn't lock | When rear seats are folded down though all kinds of rear space | I can't say enough good things about this car | 
 "words": I have had my Kia about a week | What a fun car | It has excellent pick up and you feel safe scooting out in traffic | The car is very comfortable | Easy to maneuver the seat and tilt wheel to make it comfortable | The keyless entry is great | It has a ton of trunk space | Inside is roomy enough for four people | It has a lot of extras you would not expect such as place to plug in ipod sturdy cup holders including ones in back seat CD player etc | What I found amazing was that this car had all these extras but cruise control is not standard | Overall this is a great car | It is fun and easy to drive very economical comfortable reliable safe and less expensive than the competition
 "words": Bought this vehicle seeking reasonable price point and good fuel economy | The car delivers both with excellent results | I have daily multi-destination commutes and put nearly 600 miles week on this vehicle among 3 drivers | We routinely get 30 miles gallon in mixed driving and the car is comfortable for all of us ranging from 5'5 to over 6 feet | Seats are wide enough for middle-aged spread and pickup in lower gears is exceptional | No complaints from this happy owner | Check this out before buying a Honda or Toyota Corolla | 
 "words": I wasn't looking for a Kia when I went to this dealership | A salesman talked me into test driving a Spectra 5 | I was totally surprised at how quiet and smooth this vehicle was | Road noise was absolutely minimal | The great looking interior is very comfortable | All instruments and accessories are easy to use while driving | I drove this car cross country twice and it was very comfortable the whole way | The car is very stylish | I've had numerous people inquiring about it with great interest | My wife liked the car so much that I gave it to her and bought another one identical to it | The one thing I would change would be to have head rests that pivot from front to back | What a treat | 
 "words": I drove my Kia Spectra EX Automatic over 3700 miles in Western Canada and USA after buying one month before | Excellent comfort cruise control was flawless held the road well achieved average of 35 mpg 39 in one stretch great brakes | Plenty adequate pickup on entering a freeway | Very quiet engine at highway speed of 70 or at idle wondered if in was running while waiting at a stop sign | The finish and fit is excellent | The price was right at least 3000 less than a Corolla or Civic or Jetta | I also checked it to its sister brother the Hyundai Elantra | compares well same engine nicer interior | Stereo CD radio very good | Great warranty | 
 "words": I bought my 2008 Kia used but with very few miles on it | I love the looks and the overall ride is excellent even at 80 mph on the interstate although past 80 it does get a bit shaky | I got the EX model and given a choice after the fact I would certainly look for an SX model with the sportier suspension | It does not handle that well in tight corners but I bought it for a commuter not a race car | I rated it at 8 for BUILD QUALITY and RELIABILITY simply because I just don't know | I have only had the car a month | So far so good | -
 "words": I love it | It looks great in a parking lot and sexy on the road | My friends and family all want to drive it and wish their car was a kia | I love my spectra sx | 
 "words": This vehicle is really uncomfortable to drive for more than an hour | The driver's seat curves up sharply jabbing into your rear end | I'm not a skinny guy but by no means large either | But the real disappointment is in the 23 mpg avg I'm getting | Mostly highway this is very disappointing in a car this size | Now one nice thing is that the controls are easy to reach | Second this car really has some kick | It will jump out in traffic like a 6 cylinder vehicle if you need to | But it fails to be a good ride and to be economical to drive | 
 "words": Before you pay more for a Toyota Hondaetc you owe it to yourself to look at the Kia | I bought this car a month ago and i can't say enough good about it | Style and features outside are great | Interior features and style looks and feels awesome then we get to the best part | This car handles and drives incredibly | I have the SX model which has the sport tuned suspension and it handles and feels like a sports car | I don't understand edmunds review about the motor | They say it gets noisy at high rpm not mine | The 2 | 0 in this car has plenty of power and does not require high rev's to push or pass | I have the 5 speed manual it's great | Don't overlook the Kia you'll just pay more | 
 "words": I originally had a 2006 Spectra which was totaled in an accident when someone lost control of their SUV after they were hit by someone who ran a stop sign | Fortunately the airbag worked well | I was very happy with my 2006 Spectra but before I purchased another one I wanted to see what other options I had | I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra so I promptly purchased another one and have not had even for a second any regrets | I even turned down a purchase of a 2005 Jaguar that was selling for the same price as the Spectra | I found reviews of the Spectra to be more reliable than the Jag | 
 "words": Traded in a Ford Explorer XLT due to gas mileage | I am a piano technician and have to carry tools at all times | This was a great choice after searching for 3 months | Compared American Japanese and Korean cars | I wanted the Prius but there were none to be had and then dealers were selling for market price | I made a great choice for me | I am 6'3 and above 250 lbs | Comfort is there for leg room but to me seat surfaces are not soft enough | That being my only complaint of the inside everything else is great | I love the stereo-great sound and flexibility | cd changer ipod xm to Aux input is fabulous | Easy to work | Car well laid out | Easy to read instruments | 
 "words": This is my first new car and I don't think I could have done any better | Smooth driving and great gas mileage | 
 "words": This is a fine small car that has all of the features you need at a price considerably less than the Japanese makes | Quality of the major Korean brands has improved markedly over the last 15 to 20 years and they are almost on par with the major Japanese brands | The ride is surprisingly smooth and quiet | Engine power is adequate but no ball of fire | Handling is ok but this is no sports car | This is a great first car for a teen or a second car for getting around town | With rebates the selling price of this car was 14200 TTL vs | a list price of 16700 | That is a strong price vs | what late model used cars are selling for without the strong factory warranty | 
 "words": The spectra 5 auto is fun and easy to drive | It looks great holds the road real good and handles better than the Camry LE 2008 sedan which I test drove | I also test drove the Honda Civic 2008 but with all elements considered I bought the Kia | Kia has good driving visibility I am short and the hatchback is a plus in this price range cheaper by about 5K | 
 "words": I have owned a LX for about a month now and have been pleasantly surprised at the gas economy and reliability so far | Most of the miles so far are on the highway with the A C on and I have consistently obtained 34 MPG with the maximum so far being 37 | 8 MPG | The vehicle handles very well on the highway but can be a bit awkward at low speeds | Does not handle turns very well even at low speeds | Feels like the car is going to rollover if you take those curved exit ramps at more than 30 to 35 mph | But overall considering the price I am a very satisfied owner | 
 "words": i had a rodeo before so it sucked the gas and I went and bought this car | It's not too fast but it's the sx so it's sporty | Wish it had chrome wheels and a system
 "words": I traded in my 05 Kia sportage v6 for the spectra5 sx and I gotta say you can't go wrong with these cars | I had to trade for better mileage which wasn't very good on the sportage and I'm glad I did | The spectra is fun sprite well equipped and a lot of bang for the buck | I compared Mazda3 Pontiac Vibe and Chevy Malibu and in the end I stuck with what I knew |

 "words": Overall this vehicle is great for a subcompact | The Hyundai 2 | 0 L sounds fantastic at 6000 RPM but gets rather thirsty | Engine noise is very little until you get on the freeway | Very comfy suspension with the smoothness of a Caddy until you take a sharp corner where it leans like a pickup truck | The overall build and quality of these Korean cars Hyundai Kia has been improving every year but they are still not on the same level as the Japanese | With the 100000 Mi warranty the vehicle is a great value for the price | 
 "words": We walked away with this bargain for under 12k | This has been completely reliable and fun to drive for us | Very spacious interior and you feel completely secure wrapped in airbags this is honestly the only car I have ever really enjoyed owning | Highly recommended by his owner | 
 "words": We had just purchased an Optima for my wife and I had noticed the Spectre5 on the lot | Not many cars make me stop and give them a second look but this one did | Some quick reference checks and I bought it 3 days later | Although I miss the room in my Caravan I have to say this is one of the most fun cars to drive | Gas mileage has been just under 30 MPG in mostly city type driving but I know that will get better as it breaks in | Although no car is perfect I haven't found any major items to complain about | There has been some talk of Kia not honoring their warranty but you just need to maintain very through records if not serviced at a KIA dealer
 "words": I have owned my kia for about three weeks now and I have to say I really like this car | I was a little worried switching to a 4cyl foreign car after drving 6 cyl chevys for as long as I have been driving | The car feels very sturdy while driving it | The 2 | 0 liter engine can get up and go although the engine gets kinda load over 4000 rpm | I get greats gas mileage sometimes close to 38 mpg on the highway at reasonable speeds 80 mph or less | The drivers seat leaves a good bit of room for the driver which is nice if you are 6 ft plus and there is plenty of head room | All in all I am happy I chose this car you cant beat it for the price | 
 "words": I luv this car | I have gone from a suburban to this highly fuel efficient compact car | I drive approx | 60 miles per day | It is very smooth and fun to drive | I thought the big car small car transition would be hard | Not a problem at all | But when I go from this car to my husband's suburban I feel like I'm driving a bus | Have had about 1 month and getting 31 MPG in town | My mom bought one at the same time and she can't keep my dad out of it | It's hard to explain | You just have to test drive | It has a lot of get up and go | Very easy to maneuver | Can't say enough good things | Have the SX standard | Mom has the SX automatic sister the EX nephew the SX and I will be going back for one for my son |

 "words": As of this writing the Kia is a good little car | A smooth ride and cheaper than the competitors | Learn to love that word folks its great | As a commuter I give a thumbs up | 
 "words": I have just recently purchased this vehicle | After looking at other vehicles in this class Dodge Caliber Avenger Ford Focus etc I believe this to be the best value by far | The 2 | 0 with a manual is peppy the engine is all but unnoticeable until 4k rpm About 80 in 5th and with all the convenience features I got makes me feel like I got a great deal | Gas mileage has been 22ish city thus far but I only have about 150mi on her right now and by all accounts mpg gets much better as it breaks in | Overall a great car for a person who needs affordable transportation but likes a car to have a bit of pep and personality | 
 "words": This is one of finest compact cars on the market today | The features that this car offers are absolutely phenomenal | I initially checked out other compact cars such as the Dodge Caliber Toyota Matrix Pontiac Vibe and Nissan Sentra | I have to admit that each of those cars left me desiring and seeking much more | Then I decided to check out the Kia Spectra 5 and that was the best decision I could have made | The car was everything I was looking for in a compact car | The look was sporty | The exterior quality was extremely obvious | The interior was loaded with features that even some bigger cars and SUVs didn't have | Then came the drive | I was sold and the car was mine | Thank you Kia | 
 "words": Have put about 1500 miles on in two weeks | Mixed driving city and 75 mph interstate with AC on about 25 of the time | Mileage 30-32 mpg | May get better as it breaks in | Reasonable power for an econo car | Engine noisey when pushing beyond 3500 rpm but under normal driving a very quiet pleasant ride | Good fit and finish | No wind noise in the interior unless wind is really blowing outside 30 mph | Suspension a little soft | Sounds like it is bottoming out when I hit a pothole | I intend to keep this car a long time | If it is reliable this car is an excellent buy | 
 "words": I bought my Spec5 from the dealership as soon as it was available | I do a LOT of business driving and love the roominess of the hatchback when I have to carry my supplies with me | The peppy 2 | 0 liter engine with the 5- speed makes this car a blast to drive | I'm getting almost 30 mpg in town and closer to 35 on the open road | I haven't run out of power when passing or accelerating and it climbs in the mountains great too | Never a problem in the first 8000 miles | Love the 7500 mile oil changes and of course the great warranty | 
 "words": With now 2000 miles under its belt I would like to say this was a great purchase | There are some slight noises through the cabin but overall fit and finish is very good | The manual transmission is the way to go to get the most from the engine though the clutch takes a little getting used to and rpms tend to hang a little per shift | Long strokes between gears but a 90 aftermarket short shifter should allievate this problem | Great gas mileage thus far worst MPG so far 28 | 79 mpg on the first tank best 33 | 06 mpg last tank 1806 miles | Roomier than my old 98 Explorer storage wise and lots of great features make it a welcome little car | Was really fun in the mountains just needs more HP |
