REVIEWS
 "words": After a younger generation of my family totalled my Lincoln LS on ice I was in the market for a replacement | Drove many of the reliable imports ranging from Infinity to Lexus | Then I drove the 300C | The others are all great cars but none offered the classic styling and the WOW effect of the 300C and the power of the HEMI | The car has been great so far and consistently gives 22 to 23 mpg on the highway runs visiting my kid at college | Great comfort ride and performance to boot | And unique looks to go with it | The interior could stand to be upgraded a bit | You can see where Chrysler cut corners But still very liveable inside and out | Just wish the exhaust note was a bit throatier | 
 "words": Quiet perfect for a 6' person 400 mile trips easy not fatigue | Gets around better than a 4 x 4 truck in the snow | Would be a tank with Blizzak's | Feels like a luxury car inside | 
 "words": I'd been with my car barely a month but it had been an incredible experience | The ride the interior comfort plus the looks of the car are second to none | The engine response it fantastic plenty of power to move the big body | 
 "words": I purchased my Chrysler 300 DUB Edition in July of 08 and this car is a real eye popper | Metalic black with grey leather trim and lots of chrome | Oh did I mention the 20 inch low profile wheels | I love the vehicle but here are a few suggestions Should have auto headlights heated seats and be able to upgrade the sound system for GPS and auto cell phone | One other thing it is terrible in snow and ice | I need to install snows and the price is 300 per tire | That hurts | 
 "words": I leased an 05 330C with a Hemi in it | I loved this car and was prepared to purchase it | The car was loaded and gave me zero mechanical problems | When I passed by my dealer to look around at the 08's I discussed with them the fact that leasing was not something Chrysler was pushing | However I was directed to an 08 300C Hemi with the SRT design package | It has the standard Hemi but it's own 20 inch rims handling package steering exhaust and other features from the SRT8 | The fuel savings not available on the SRT8 are available on the car I purchased | I love it | Great aggressive styling with multivalve- displacement giving better mileage | Have yet to see one like it on the road | 
 "words": Have my 2nd | 300C and couldn't be more satisfied | Comfort performance are the best features | Highway mpg is 27- 28 but have seen 30 many times | The available power is a plus | Only concern is the size of the brakes needs better stopping ability otherwise it is the best value around for the money | Huge trunk and ergonomic perfection | 
 "words": Terrific car | Saved 8000 with demo rebate | would take over Lex | 350 and Cadillac cts | why pay extra 10 k | getting 28 mpg on highway | love gps satellite radio | Luxury | Chrysler got this right | Dealer was terrific | leather seats support well | can't say enough good things about this car | 3 | 5 L is more than enough power | check this vehicle out | 
 "words": I saw the 2005 300 and knew THAT was a car | Once they offered lifetime warranty I felt it was time to get that dream car before they re-design it | I got the Touring V6 as I do not need a Hemi to say I have arrived or for the thrill of it | I have taken two long trips already and find the car very comfortable and economical | I get around 18 around town and up to 28 on the highway | The AWD is a must in Alaska | Knowing that it has the E-class suspension and 4-matic transmission is very comforting | I hear people think the interior is lacking but I guess after 5 years of big Ford trucks it seems quite plush to me | I did get some upgrades that included extra airbags and the blue tooth | 
 "words": To me the car is flawless except for some parts to the interior | Why there is only an off-White headliner is beyond me | Cream or light tan would add so much more class | The total black dash with tortoise-shell accents is great but the headliner should either match or be contrasted with something softer | The two-toned dash looks off somehow | Also a body style like this craves darker colors like maroon metal flake to show off the lines | Color selection is so limited | Right now only black looks good enough to buy | The dash could be more 3- dimensional and not so flat but the blue glow should stay | You guys are close though | 
 "words": Best car ever for the money | I hope they don't change the design this one is 1 for good
 "words": I just put 18000 miles on a 2008 Impala LT in 6 months and swapped to the 08 300 LX both are company fleet vehicles and equipped with fleet packages | Both cars are about the same money but the Impala handled much better | The 300 doesn't hold a center line and is very susceptible to cross winds | The Impala had more features auto headlights dual climate controls flex fuel remote start as standard | The 2 | 7 motor in the 300 is okay when cruising but it really works on hills | The 300 is roomier and is distinctive looking vs the rental car look of the Impala | The 300 is boring to drive think Buick LeSabre Ford or Mercury rear drive cars | I would have rather had a hemi and sport suspension | 
 "words": I own a Mercedes S430 that I drive as a personal vehicle and purchased the 300 Hemi AWD as my company car | I have driven the car 12000 miles in the last 4 months and love it | It is as comfortable as my Mercedes and has many of the same features | Had I owned the 300 prior to the Mercedes I would never have purchased the Mercedes | The 300 is just as much fun to drive has the same comfort level and only lacks some rear seat leg room in comparison | This won't be my last 300 but this will be my last MB S430 | 
 "words": I love my Hemi | I went from an '01 Avalon to this hemi | My Avalon was a little more luxurious than my hemi but the car handles so much better | It really turns heads | The Avalon looks so much like the other Toyotas that people didn't know that I had a top of the line car | This one looks feels and is a much better buy | Easy on the eyes and I get as much or better gas mileage as my Avalon | I was a die hard Toyota fan but this car has changed my mind | I love it | 
 "words": Leased this beauty 2 months and 3000 miles ago-compared it to many foreign and domestic sedans before making my choice-have not regretted it for 1 minute | Car is simply amazing to drive and to look at | Hemi power is as advertised-IMO much better than the GM 4 | 6l northstar or any of the high output V6's | Size is perfect for me and my family of 3 kids | Ride around town or all day drives are incredibly comfortable | Luxury items like bluetooth nav incredible stereo the 370 watt stereo w mygig is just nuts | I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years-nothing I've ever compares to this | OK I'm running out of adjectives | 
 "words": This car is styling profiling so let's size it up | If you trust the pro reviews the 2 | 7 is just too wimpy to swing this bad boy around | Not enough power they whine | Sure I'd love to have the Hemi SRT8 | But I can't even imagine how powerful that car must be | But there's NOTHING wimpy about the 2 | 7 | It zips and zooms handles like a dream | So for around 20k I get a stylish luxurious head-turner with Mercedes E Class underpinnings | Sure everyone THINKS the car is way faster than it is | And maybe that's why the pros dig on the 2 | 7 | It's just not worthy | But I LOVE this car | It saved me from boring large boring sedanville | Definitely the coolest big boy sedan under 25K | 
 "words": I like the car except for a couple of minor issues | I love the 4 8 cylinder switching | The power is instant when you need it | Too bad the molding was coming loose on the first day we owned it | Also the cup holders are in the stupidest place possible | If you actually put cups even small in them you have a hard time getting to the gear shift | The lack of a trash can or even a place to stick one in a car this big is annoying | 
 "words": I purchased the base line model after test driving more expensive imports | For the price it was a no-brainer | If I had known how much I would enjoy this car I probably would have spent more and purchased the touring model | Still my car looks and drives like a MUCH more expensive auto | gets good gas mileage with this smaller engine and has been trouble free | 
 "words": Had an '96 Avalon needed new car | Looked at Avalon and 300C | Bought 300C AWD and never looked back | Best decision we ever made | Avalon was NOT the trouble free car made out to be | Took 300C delivery in October traveled to Fl | in Jan and to the West in Feb | What a road machine | Went up Interstate mountain roads full 70 mph without any transmission shifting | Never had any vehicle do that | Engine would simply go from 4 cyl to 8 | No effort making the climb | Hit snow in some high elev and the AWD had us going when others were having all kinds of fun | Did 70 mph on the level running on 4 cyl | This car brings back the pleasure of driving | Had forgotten how great driving could be | 
 "words": 55 mph30 mpg 65 mph 27 1000 mile trip 75 mph and city driving gave me 24 | 7 mpg very surprising | Last year my pt cruiser got 21 | 5 same trip | Traded in a 2005 mustang and a Mercedes and we love this car | It is a little of both | 2008 is so beautiful with changes to trunk rear light and inside | Didn't know it had so many add ons | 0-60 timer is neat | If you can buy the heritage edition do it | See one and u will understand | The power is terrific | 400 lbs of torque | People's heads screw around versions of this car have been around since 2005 | They edge up to look inside | To me all the other competitors look like someone stomped on their hood | Ugly lot | This car makes old fellow like me happy | 
 "words": First I want to say about the review below | are you kidding me | You're 5'11 and had troubles in this car | What other CAR have you ever driven that is more comfortable for you | I'm 6'7 and have NEVER been this comfortable in a car | I usually have to drive full-size SUV's and trucks to be comfortable | Also loud engine | What are you comparing this car to | a Rolls | My opinion | this is hands-down the best car I have ever owned or driven | Incredible interior exterior performance 3 | 5 V6 gas mileage reliability price and any other category you want to consider | I would have loved to be able to spring for the SRT | But this V6 is wonderful in this car would not recommend the 2 | 7 | 
 "words": Nicely styled exterior with those narrow windows results in limited visibility that is borderline dangerous | Between the front roof post and side view mirrors | look out on turns | The interior was spacious but bland with nothing to recommend or criticize too hard | I had the V6 which made the car's interior sound like a truck and was the noisiest I've driven in years | It did provide good acceleration and was well matched to the car's below average handling | The engine was not as thirsty as I feared | I got 22-24 mpg in mostly suburban driving | Handling is only adequate you really have to work the steering wheel and the car's long wheelbase doesn't help | 
 "words": I myself have 300 touring a 2007 I absolutely love my car | It is a very smooth ride lots of comfort | I have 2 children that are 6 foot tall and they can ride in my car and be very comfortable | I would highly recommend this car to anyone | If you want style and class as well as comfort then this is the car for you you | 
 "words": I was very reluctant to purchase an American car after experiencing the reliability of some Japanese makes but I must say this car feels extremely well built and it really delivers a superior ride and feel than the Japanese cars I've driven | Even with the base LX you still get a well appointed semi-luxurious ride with an adequate engine | It's tough to complain about the 2 | 7L when it delivers gas mileage in the mid to high 20's | I am really impressed with this car and would highly recommend it | If you're looking at any Nissan Honda or Toyota in the low-mid 20's give the 300 a chance | 
 "words": So I went against the preferred engine and really I think the concerns are a little overrated about it | I think if you want performance slapping a massive engine in it wouldn't satisfy my personal preferences | In saying that we bought this because 4 gas will soon be a reality | The car rides incredible the fit and finish is the best of any Chrysler I have owned by far | The road noise is minimal and the look is just sleek it looks like a much more expensive car | The stereo sounds great and the sets are very top notch | We traded in a Durango and this has more leg room in the rear then our SUV had | I am really pleased with my purchase and the 25 mpg makes me smile | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle for a few months now and I could not be happier | Not only is it fun to drive but it always seems to draw attention | A lifetime powertrain warranty was icing on the cake for me | Will definitely purchase another Chrysler | 
 "words": Just bought this vehicle after being a big Cadillac Seville fan | I was looking for an AWD vehicle and looked at the Infiniti M and Lexus GS finally drove this one and for about 12k less based on my final cost this was hands down the best buy | Interior design and materials aren't Lexus or Infiniti but they are far better than any of the other vehicles I had looked at including the Cadillac | Good ride will go through anything within reason excellent entertainment system great seats and one of the few cars that you can get rear seat heaters in | Back seat is comfortable and you actually have leg room | Exceptionally quiet too | The price after rebates and discounts was amazing | 
 "words": The first six days of ownership were great and enjoyable | Great ride and appearance | Drove the Hemi and 3 | 5 V6 | noticed a heavier fell with the Hemi | but mileage and price for 3 | 5 was great | Just over a week of ownership I needed to use the windshield washer and when I hit it the electrical system died killing the engine | A immedate release of the windshield washer resulted in a immedate restart but in a lower gear requiring me to pull off the road | In heavy traffic and at high speed this event could have been a significant risk to us and those that might had been behind us | Dealer has ordered parts yet concerned that circuit board damage was result vs cause | Time will tell | 
 "words": What at great car love the interior and exterior | Handles like a dream great responce love to drive again | Mileage for me is about 18 to 20 wife ranges 20 to 22 don't know why | Not bad for a hemi though | Acceleration is there when you need it the faster you go the nicer the ride | 
 "words": I love my new SRT 8 | I have been an owner of a Lexus GS and an Infinity 4 | 5 | They both are Yugo's compared to this | I love the power and fit and finish is great | Any stoplight drag race is mine from now on | I don't think I'll ever go back to imports
 "words": This is one great car | Extremely comfortable powerful fast I see too many speeding tickets in my future and it handles great as well | Excellent ride quality and responsive if somewhat numb steering | Averaging over 20 MPG in mixed driving and that's during the first 1000 miles | Upgraded Boston Acoustics stereo is worth the money makes the car a rolling sound studio | Exceptional build quality for an American car | I personally see no downside to the car except possibly the gas mileage but what do you expect from a 5 | 7L V-8 | 
 "words": Bought car then set off for North Carolina | Handled great on freeways | Gas consumption above anticipated level | Great car to drive | Recommend it highly | Wife likes it too | Go Chrysler | keep 'em coming
