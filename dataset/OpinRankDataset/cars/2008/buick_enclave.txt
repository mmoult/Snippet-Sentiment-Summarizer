REVIEWS
 "words": We bought our Enclave a little over two weeks ago | We are very satisfied with our purchase | The vehice interior is very luxury | The outside vehicle design is very appealling | 
 "words": Great car on the highway | Very quiet | The driving around town in moderate traffic can cause frustration with the lack of response when the gas peddle is depressed while traveling at speeds in the 25-35 mph range | Sometimes depending on the gear you are in you may not get much of a response initially unless you really press hard | Sometimes it will downshift and the rpms can shoot to over 5000 when all you wanted to do was go around a slightly slower car | Can be difficult at times | 
 "words": Great car | We have had the car for 18 months now and have been very satisfied with everything except the rear visibility | Unfortunately the blind spot to the rear on both the passenger and drivers side make it a little nerve racking to drive in traffic | The DVD monitor also blocks the Rearview mirror
 "words": My wife and I find this to be a very good car | It is roomy comfortable and classy-looking | I can't understand why certain consumer magazines don't give this a thumbs up | I liked the fact that someone from the GM shop floor rang me to see how I liked it | This is a great American car we're proud to have it | 
 "words": Waited until we had owned for a year before writing a review | Our Enclave is the nicest vehicle I've ever owned | My first American car '75 Chevy Monte Carlo was also my last because it was junk | Bought my first import new '87 Honda Accord have disparaged American cars since | Then I had the Enclave Experience | What a great American car | I was actually proud to be able to buy and recommend an American car | We use it primarily for long trips and have spent 10 hours on the road in absolute comfort | We have small kids and the entertainment system Bose w satellite and DVD keeps everyone happy | Six adults fit easily | It's beautiful and even strangers complement it | Get one | 
 "words": I have 25000 miles on my enclave and haven't had any major issues with my vehicle | On the highway at 50-55 mph I have easily gotten 30 mpg or better with the cruise on | At 60-65 mph with the cruise on I get about 29 mph | The on-star service eliminates my need for a navigation unit | I fill my tank every 9 days | The sunroof problem was easily fixed in one visit and I have had no more leaks | It turned heads the same day I purchased it and folk continue to drive up beside me and ask about it along with expressing how much they want one | Stick with the routine maintenance and chances are your buick will be on the road for a long time | 
 "words": Took awhile to get used to the six speed transmission but I now love the car | We have taken two long trips 12000 milesand fell in love with the car | Very quiet compared to the GMC and Saturn versions just great to drive on the freeway at high speeds | sticks to the road and very smooth | better than any Cadillac I ever owned
 "words": This vehicle is quite comfortable to drive and that is where my satisfaction ends | It has been back to the dealership many times for numerous problems | As of tonight you can't even shut the car off | We are driving a loaner | Had to get the jack out of the car and you need an engineering degree to do that | Would never want to have to use it along the road | Degree sensor problems navigation problems transmission not shifting properly | If this is the kind of quality that you get for a vehicle this expensive it is no wonder General Motors is in the position they are | This is my last G | M | I guess it's Ford of Toyota from here on out
 "words": The Enclave is a great vehicle but a few things Buick needs to change 1 | Rain gutter over the doors in rain or after an open door leads to the seat below getting soaked with the runoff from the roof | 2 | If you open the rear seat windows while the front windows are up the vibration is incredible the car shakes badly this is a problem | 3 | Put the outside temperature gauge on the mirror with the compass | The passenger my wife cannot see the temp in the dash cluster and I'm tired of having to tell her what the temperature outside is every 30 miles | 
 "words": We purchased the model with 2nd row bench seat so we could put the childs car seat in the middle | The middle compartment does move but she can still kick the audio dials facing the 2nd row | The outside rear view mirrors block when turning left or right for someone that is short | The GPS system leaves a lot to be desired | We have a Garmin portable in the other vehicle and it does a lot better job | On sunny days rear navigation system cannot be seen | Wish it had better gas mileage | 
 "words": I have only had the Enclave for a few days but love driving it | I get many stares from people and people can't believe it's a Buick once they see it and look inside | Very roomy and great looking from every angle | Looked at Mazda CX9 and Volvo XC90 | the Buick puts both to shame | It is roomier than both and although fully loaded doesn't have all the Mazda has to offer and the Mazda was a lot cheaper to lease I don't regret my decision to go with the Buick over the Mazda | The steerable headlights are great at night | and unlike the Mazda you aren't forced to choose between a rear seat DVD and a sunroof | the Buick has two roofs | Congrats GM on finally getting it right | Former Audi owner
 "words": So after much consideration between all the lambda options we kept coming back to the Buick Enclave CXL | The Saturn was nice but we kept thinking the resale was going to be the lowest of all three | The GMC was great but no perferated seats we live in NC and leather and sun don't mix well | and no cocoa interior | So we settled on the Enclave | And are very happy we did | Everywhere we go people want to look inside and are blown away at how large it is in interior volume | When I tell them it is the same as a Tahoe or Yukon they are amazed | This really is a minivan inside and sport utility outside | 
 "words": I traded my 2003 Lexus GX470 for the Enclave | I questioned my decision so many times but in the end decided to go with the Buick | Yes a Lexus for a Buick | I think I was just ready for a change and from the first time I saw the Enclave I knew I liked it | For one it drives as nice as the Lexus and feels more like driving a car which I also traded-Honda Accordon the Enclave | Yes two perfectly good vehicles for one | So far I like the Enclave | I too have noticed it hesitates trying to get up to speed but once you do it's fine | Gas mileage is 14-22 | Maybe it will get better | I hope at least driving around town | All in all I'm happy with my trade | I love the look of the it | Very sharp | 
 "words": Traded my BMW 3-series for this car | With a Lexus and a Bimmer never thought I'd get a Buick but couldn't find anything we liked better after looking at the Audi Q7 BMW X5 Lexus GX | None of those had as much 3rd row back seat room or ease of access as the Enclave | And this comes with nearly the same bells and whistles | Yes a few parts appear cheap but the quality and elegance of the rest of the interior far outpowers them | Cabin feels like flying first class in a plane | 5 | 1 Bose surround sounds amazing | Wish it had automatic self- closing driver passenger doors they're german car heavy | Handling suprisingly sporty rides smooth quiet | This is the car that will save Buick | 
 "words": We have about 6000 miles on this great great car | It is fun to drive has exceptional room is really comfortable and everyone else loves it too | The interior has absolutely no cheap look or feel | So what if there is fake wood trim | I would rather have that than have to worry about keeping the finish on real wood | The transmission has been no problem at all | It is very smooth and the car is powerful enough to easily accelerate to highway speeds when merging with traffic | I looked at the MDX and the Mazda whatever it is numbered | They don't even come close to the value in this vehicle | 
 "words": Oldsmobiles and Buicks park avenues have always upstood the times with me | Do not rotate my cars but drive the life out of them | Never owned a SUV until now | Love it | Went to the dealership to see pricing of the Lucerne and was shown the Enclave | Although I am single after test driving I knew it was for me | Handles like a car while also wowing my clients | From the stylish exterior to the classy interior I have enjoy the comfort of driving this since November 2007 | I am very pleased with my selection | Gas mileage is improving as I break it in | I get about 22 miles to the gallon on the road | I have driven approx | 8000 miles | I would highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": Buick has hit a home run with this vehicle | It is smooth exceptionally quiet roomy comfortable great for trips performs well a pleasure to drive very stable no quality flaws nicely equipped well thought out interior exterior design and finally a great value | 
 "words": Really enjoying this Enclave | It's fun to drive | A lot of room and it's an eye catcher | The only problem we had so far is the remote starter | It only good for about 200 feet | 
 "words": After deciding we needed a more economical car to take the family and four dogs to our weekend place about 150 miles from home we started looking at SUV's CUV's etc | I used to drive Mercedes wagons and I was drawn back to them but the middle row leg room is too short for our tall adult-sized children and the other Mercedes that did fit us the R class could not haul a trailer that we sometimes use | Enter the Enclave | I took delivery on a CXL this week and so far I am very impressed | I've only gassed up once but it got well over 20 mpg in mixed driving | The ride is comfortable and I like the solid feel to the doors when you shut them very unlike a Honda | 
 "words": Ordered the Enclave in December and received in late February | Nice suv crossover | Heavy car that rides reasonable nice and very quite | I'm looking forward to future editions already to improve on some of the deficiencies that many have already described | Overall I'm very pleased with this first time purchase of a Buick | I previously owned several GM TrailBlazers and S10 Blazers | This vehicle is big inside and out | The cockpit feel is true and I flew a plane and can attest to the similar look and feel of the Cessna | Lots of forward glass with a clear unobstructed view | Back window view is very small but not a big deal | I ordered without the overhead retractable window | Overall nice vehicle
 "words": I purchased the Enclave 3000 miles ago | less than a month and I was generally impressed with the vehicle until I drove it under various situations | In a nutshell any wonderful features I enjoyed have been eclipsed by the incredibly terrible transmission | It is just not a pleasure to drive in the hills of western PA | This transmission does not know how to handle them | I'm taking it in this Monday for service Buick tells me there is a recall for Transmission Calibration my suggestion for anyone interested is waitil the bugs are cleared up on this vehicles transmission | It will negate all the beautiful and comfortable features this vehicle has and ruin the driving experience | 
 "words": Loved this car | Great interior good build quiet | God interior material good controls | However there is a problem with the transmission | Had to be reprogramed after a month because shift points were way off | Had to drop the trans ro replace control module at 10k miles leaked out all trans fluid after the replacement and is now back in the shop for a week to replace same part and they can not get all of the seals necessary to finish | Wife is furious and wants do dump it now | Why can GM not get it all together | Finally got a winner and screwed it up |

 "words": I love love love the Enclave | Mine is the CXL fully loaded | Black with cashmere interior | Other people sure do a lot of staring | It is just beyond classy | My first experience from November to February was frustrating because the engine light kept coming on | As of yesterday Feb | 22nd problem has been resolved | I'm a first time buyer with GM and consider it a great move | 
 "words": Toyota and Honda are not the best in this market | I looked at the Lexus and the Accura and they did not provide the same number of benefits to justify their added costs | I really like the styling of the Buick much better than it's competitors | As far as the power is concerned | It is more than enough | It is a crossover vehicle not a sprint car | If you hate minivans but want enough room for your family with all the modern creature comforts like xenon lights nav 2 dvds xm leather 2 sunroofs in a really solid vehicle | I feel the Buick is the best choice | I am only 40 something I didn't think I would ever own a Buick | Friends neighbors can't believe how nice this car is | 
 "words": I've had my Enclave a little over a month now and I love it | I spent six months testing different makes of suvs and crossovers and the Enclave is in a class of it's own | It was love at first sight | Such a smooth and quiet ride and the interior is so spacious and elegant | The exterior is unique and hands down the best looking crossover on the road today | I have to say that Buick has outdone themselves | 
 "words": This is my first GM product since 1989 | I actually read about the Saturn Outlook first but fell for the Enclave the minute I test drove it | It is very roomy inside but doesn't feel like a moose to maneuver around town | 
 "words": We bought our Gold Mist CXL about a month ago this is the third Enclave in our neighborhood and my wife and kids love it | The ride quality and quietness of the vehicle is far superior than our Sienna we traded in | Had an ice storm last night and my wife made it home without any problems and we only have FWD | We love the backup camera and park assist which is great considering the small window in the back | Overall this is an excellent vehicle that meets our luxury requirements with interior room similiar to a minivan | Only negative is the less than ideal gas mileage we are getting 14 MPG city | 
 "words": I love my Enclave | It rides so smooth handling great in the snow | I was hopeing for a little better gas milage averages 16 17 20max on highway | The interior is sharp w wood grain and leather seats | I did get the DVD Nav combo and use the Navigation daily w my job | This vehicle is very roomy I have space in the back to store items and also seating for 7 | Do wish the 2nd row of seats could be adjusted front and back to give the back seat passangers more leg room if needed | 
 "words": Looks good and feels good | The bells and whistles could be better quality | Not enough power | Transmission seems to have problems finding gears | My check engine light has come on 3 times | Most frustrating is the car leaks when it rains | the car is now rusting inside from it | the car has been in for service 3 times and they still have not fixed it right |

 "words": My wife and I are both very picky when it comes to cars and we usually only stick with imports that have high reliability ratings | A little over two years ago we wouldn't have even considered Buick or any GM for that matter when we wanted to look for a new SUV but when I saw the Enclave revealed at the Detroit Auto Show back in 06 I immediately liked it's styling | My biggest complaint with U | S | auto makers over the last 20 years or so is primarily not build quality although it has been relatively poor but design | The Enclave's design is what did it for me | We absolutely love the Enclave | I don | t regret it for one second |

 "words": This car is hands down the classiest looking large crossover suv on the market | Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class | I never thought I'd buy a Buick but after istting in this car and test driving it we knew we had found a winner | GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free | Other reviewers have mentioned it the car would benefit from more power but then again gas isn't going back to 2 gallon anytime soon and for around town there's plenty of power | How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway | Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier and really make this a hands down winner it its class |
