REVIEWS
 "words": I have to reply to a couple of earlier posts | I get from 26 | 5 to 29 mpg on my daily driving 40 miles round trip so I was surprised about the rating | Also I'm still driving on the first set of tires at 17500 miles | I read a review that listed 3 sets of tires in the first 20000 miles | It does seem to have blind spots when trying to back up but overall it is easy to drive and easy to park | It has a huge trunk large enough for luggage for 4 on a 5 day trip | I bought this used with 7000 miles and now over 17000 and have not had any repairs at all | 
 "words": I love driving my car however I have put on 17000 miles and I am getting ready to put on the 3rd set of tires | Dealership says these cars eat tires and I agree | At 200 | 00 a pop for 205 50R17 they are expensive | 
 "words": This is kind of tricky since I owned a 28000 dollar jetta before this car | It gets pretty good gas millage for have allwheel drive I get 28 | 1 though 29 | 0 mpg most of the time but not in winter winter I see about 20-24 mpg I live in Indiana so I see alot of snow | I love the room in this car with a wheel base of 98 I can sure fit alot of cargo with the seats down | I love the sound system I got the 9 speaker premium sound and it pretty good | Note though my jetta had a eight speaker sound system that sound just as good with better bass and had no subwoofer in it | Love the no key start now I hate using other peoples cars | Basically a good car for the 18 thousand | 
 "words": This car is an amazing deal and has been terrific so far | It flies under the radar screen because Suzuki doesn't seem to promote their cars too well | I'm glad I did the research and found it | After 7000 miles no problems at all and I love driving it | 
 "words": This is one of the best cars that I have owned | Fun to drive very responsive lots of interior room a very good ride for a smaller car | With all the extras like climate controlcruise control outside temp | indicator computer for milage P G and fuel distance left in tank all the control are handy | Suzuki did a fine job putting this vehicle together | I would recommed that anyone looking for a car take a good look at this one before making your mind up on a purchase of a car like this | 
 "words": I purchased this car for my first car and it is pretty impressive considering the price | At first it felt very slightly underpowered considering that I was used to driving a car with 260 horsepower but in reality it isn't bad | The handling on it is amazing | It takes turns quickly and the tires stick to the road well | I live in Pennsylvania and the traction control and AWD make it a very good car for snow | Also the touring package comes with a 9-speaker 6-CD changer which sounds amazing | It is probably one of the best car stereos I've heard | The only small downside is I have only been getting 20 mpg but that's using full throttle a lot | Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase | 
 "words": I bought this car for my wife who had just learned to drive foreigner and she absolutely loves it | It is spacious for a small car with plenty of room in the trunk for a full size suit case laid down flat | The car lacks power which they advertise as more than a MINI but you really have to put your foot into it or use gear 1 to launch it and to merge onto Interstate traffic | Radio is sufficient 4 speaker single Cd player Head room is great for tall people we are not AWD is not perm | but can be locked in as long as driving below 30mph | I had a 350z before this so this car can not be compared to but is still funish to drive | 
 "words": This is the very first brand new vehilce purchase I have ever made | I am quite disappointed | The exterior paint is cheap sensitive scratches down to the metal extremely easily I have had to pay for protectant because of bird droppings marking it | The interior plastic dash doorsscratch extremely easily and the upholstery snags like mad as well | The little windows on the front sides create blind spots | The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg | Small gas tank | Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests | Not terribly comfortable | Hard to handle in strong winds | Back seat not much leg room | Not family car
 "words": A good dependable vehicle for a good price | Also came with a great warranty and road side assistance | This is the first Suzuki I've owned and I would recommend it tomy family and friends | 
 "words": My Ocean Blue SX4 Sport now has 16000 miles | Its been very comfortable fairly reliable and still gets looks and compliments on its styling | Rear seat needs to fold down | At first I thought that the trunk was huge but the lack of a fold-down rear seat is a huge pain | Rear seat legroom is tight and you will need BOTH hands on the wheel on windy days | The car is very sensitive to crosswinds especially at high speeds | Fuel mileage has averaged 26 | 7 mpg in mostly interstate driving which is good not great | 
 "words": Runs ok in slow driving areas | Not good in California 4 speed transmission needs all it has for Highway Driving | Windshield broke by itself at 13000 miles nothing hit it The Dealer said it is not covered by the Warranty | It fishtails if you need to swerve because runs in front of car at 40 mph | Gas for me is 29 MPG | The GPS stopped working and needed to be replaced at 10000 miles | The fender needed to be fixed because it was coming apart at 2000 miles | This car is problematic | Next time I'm going to a Honda or older Oldsmobile or Buick or VW | 
 "words": I looked at the Mazda 3 the Toyota Corolla and the Nissan Sentry before I settled happily on the Suzuki SX4 | This is a great car | I never understood it when people said a car can be fun to drive until now | The shifting is smooth and seamless the car is very peppy and responsive and the acceleration leaves nothing to be desired | I enjoy getting in my car to go anywhere now | The quality of the car is great too | It feels solid and firm and is solid on the road | The cockpit is roomy and very comfortable | The stereo system and sound is just right | Everything just feels right with this car | The gas milage is very good | I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting 28 mpg in the city | 
 "words": This is my second Suzuki and I am rather impressed I purchased a Forenza and I will say the SX4 is a huge improvement in so many ways | The car is actually fun to drive with unique style and its easy to own I have had this car for about a year now and I have had no issues with the car so far | This has been one of my favorite cars to own so far | The 4 speed auto is a bit sluggish to respond and the lack of an auto stick type trans was a bit disapointing but it still gets the job done | There is just enough horse power to get you onto the highway and above legal posted limits quickly so this car is no slug | From a red light the car may not seem to be to impressive just wait and see
 "words": I have had the car for 10 months now and I still love it | It has been great in the ice and snow | I have gotten up hills that other cars were slipping and sliding on | The traction control and anti-lock breaks have kept me going in a straight line when other cars in front and behind me have been fishtailing | In addition to being very reliable and safe it is a blast to drive | It is so comfortable that my husband always wants me to drive even though his Saturn gets better gas mileage | I'm averaging 27 MPG and I drive 100 miles a day back and forth to work | I test drove a Honda Fit and Civic because they got better gas mileage but they just didn't feel as substantial as the SX4 | 
 "words": I love this car | It drives great especially in the snow | Mileage is pretty accurate to the sticker | Very comfortable for a small car | 
 "words": Nice AWD car that is a joy to to drive | I just wish it had more hp | It's suppose to be a rally car | Make one with a super charger | 
 "words": Hub caps are plastic alarm doesn't include trunk | Not happy with the car | I would dump in a heartbeat if I could get someone to buy it from me | Rear seats do not fold down | 
 "words": I really love my car | I think it looks sporty for an economy car | I just wish it had more horsepower and torque | My sport edition did not come with the driving lights or cruise control which is about the only thing I can complain about | Other than the 2009 model has an integrated GPS | But in the total package I would say the car is well worth it | 
 "words": As a realtor I drive a lot of miles so I decided to buy this nice SX4 sedan sport with navigation as a second car | Believe it or not I purchased this car because it had a gps navi but fell in love with it | You get a lot of car for much less money than other brands | 17 wheels fog lamps smart pass entry keyless start rear spoiler ground effect spoilers all around | I feel like in the purchase of a navi you get a free car | This car is worth much more than what is priced for | 
 "words": I can say I am pleased with this car | So far the only return trip to the dealer is for an oil change | The front tires aren't even feathering which seems to be an issue on other makes I have owned | Suggested Improvements This is all based on the SX4 Sport Sedan Sunroof option remote start leather seating with heated seats auto up down windows on all four windows auto locking doors at 15 mph auto unlocking doors when shifted into park auto on off headlights smaller keyless remote that doesn't take up some much room in your pocket longer wheel base to improve looks give more rear seat leg room better gas mileage with better acceleration larger fuel tank for longer driving 
 "words": We bought this car for safety air bag protection and traction in snow and ice in Wyoming | Also zero percent financing | It is the best decision we have ever made | My wife loves this car and we have driven to Denver Estes Park Yoder Wyoming with no problems | 
 "words": I test-drove the Chevrolet Cobalt Mazda 3 and Nissan Sentra | For the money the Suzuki SX4 Sport is the best | The Cobalt would have cost 20 less a month purchase but was the no- options manual-windows-and-all version in white no other colors available at that dealer | The Mazda 3 was fun and well optioned | But it was 20 more a month | The Nissan was funny | Neat interrior but weird seats and looks | And it was about 30 more a month | Now the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3 the cool interior similar to the Sentra and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt | The paint is fantastic I got the dark grey | And it drives like a sport sedan | 
 "words": I purchased the SX4 in December of 07 | Being my first new car it has been the best compared to my 91 Lincoln Mark 7 and my 95 Mazda 626 | It feels like you're doing laps around a go-cart track | It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times | My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series | She loved it until she crashed it | Wasn't anything major but the front bumper radiator grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her | It's funny how the first accident my mom's ever gotten in | It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job another great thing about SX4
 "words": Overall this is a fun to drive little car | It handles the curves surprisingly well and has decent power for an auto | I had a modified Subaru and the Suzuki hugs the curves just as good in stock form | Not the fastest car on earth but it will put a smile on your face | So far we have put nearly 5000 miles on the odometer with no issues | Our sedan has the optional 17 black painted wheels with machined face and they really set the car apart | With the addition of front fog lamps it looks great | So far gas mileage is on par with the sticker but we have yet to get over 30mi to a gallon even on a 175 mile one way trip to the beach we never got over 26mi to a gallon | 
 "words": My new car | How great is it to get a great new car under 20k | For a young woman of 23 years awesome | I love my car and think I will continue to be a Suzuki owner for a long long time | 
 "words": Looking a new car for me to commute to work | Test drove Saturn Astra Toyota Matrix and Suzuki SX4 Sport with convenience pkg | After compare with the price and warranty the SX4 is the final winner | This car is easy to handle and with about 30 MPG city and highway combine but shakes between 65-80 miles hr | Took it back and Suzuki dealer spend two day to work on it | I picked up the car and they told me it was the balance problem of the tires which is not true | The car still shakes and who knows how many time I need to take this car back to Suzuki to get it fixed | 
 "words": Suzuki SX4 ZXi car though boasts of high end features it's crap when it comes to quality | I have brought new SX4 on 4-4-2008 | The reverse shifting gear was hard to function from outset | When I asked about it Suzuki people told it's designed like that only | When it ran 4900 kmjust before second free service the shifting gear reverse got jammed | To add further woes water started pouring into front cabin from the bottom | 
 "words": Quick road hugging and fun to drive | I have had several small cars such as Toyota Matrix 04 Honda Accord 92 and Chevy Aveo 06 | The SX4 beats them all in overall performance | The trunk room is great and the interior room head room cannot be beaten for a car of its class | My daughter is a tall 5ft10ins and she loves sitting in the rear | The car is perfect for commuting and long travel | So before you buy your gas saver test drive the SX4 you will not be disappointed |

 "words": I bought my SX4 Sport new in April and after 7000 miles I really enjoy this car | I originally looked at a Mazda 3 but for the same price and options as the SX4 I would have ended up with a used Mazda 3 with 30000 miles on it | For the money its hard to beat the SX4 good gas mileage nice interior warranty 17 alloys and more | I drive a lot in town and the highway for my job and I have been averaging 28 mpg combined | If you are looking in Ft | Collins CO I recommend Dellenbach they were extremely nice and didn't pressure me while looking

 "words": That's what it reminds me of sitting in the driveway a cute little bug | I've already taken it on a trip to Erie and I thought it great on the highway | A very zippy little car | I did a ton of research on the internet before purchasing what I consider to be my last new car mainly looking for 4cyl | AWD and relatively cheap | It's a great little 4 cylinder with AWD | It'll never have the speed my '70 camaro had but at least I can actually pass by the gas station all week long | So far I have not been disappointed | I can't wait to see how it does in our PA winters | 
 "words": Had the car about a week and am very pleased with it so far | Smallish backseat area though | needs another couple inches of legroom | Outstanding highway power and ride about 26 mpg on the last tank of gas but the car only has 1100 miles on it so that should improve | I got compliments from everyone at work on the styling of the car one guy told me it looks like a European rally race car | 
 "words": This is my first new car I'm pushing 50 so I have driven many cars over the years | I have to tell you I just love this little bug what my family calls her | I've already taken it on a 350 trip and had to keep watching my speed after finding myself going over 75 a few times | Yes merging back onto the interstate wasn't the fastest but let's remember what we were driving folks a great little 4 cyl | that is fun to drive and got great mileage right out of the gate | The stereo sounded good and I do like the auto climate controls | I can't wait to see how she does in our western PA winters | Definitely a keeper I think | 
 "words": I have 2000 miles on my SX4 now and it just keeps getting better | I have all the bells and whistles | Like XM radio mp3 hook up 9 speaker sound 6 disk CD | Also the cold-air intake underdrive pulley and the piggyback ECU | The SX4 is very fun to drive | The switchable FWD AWD and 4WD lock is great |
