 "words": This is not a bad car at all setting aside from numerous dealership visits within the 25k miles I have clocked with this vehicle | The engine is very smooth quiet yet not as powerful as I would like even with the manual transmission | The down points for this car is various suspension noises horrible manual transmission factory flywheel combo | At about 5000 miles the manual transmission had to be replaced | Right after various TSB's were performed for interior noises passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced | Now I hear clanking in the suspension area when going over any type of bump or road imperfection | Also interior plastic clips are getting loose which make noise |

 "words": Superb handling awesome looks | What more could I ask for | My only complaint is the | wait I don't have any | 
 "words": I just got this car as a graduation present and it is amazing | I used to drive a New Beetle so i'm used to smaller cars | This is the perfect size has amazing handling and the GPS nav is worth every penny | 
 "words": Brief a medium sized high technology luxury sports car which will have 1 or 2 people in it most of the time | I researched and drove BMW Audi and Mercedes before settling on Lexus | I was upgrading from a SAAB convertible | To compare the cars you need to spec up each car equally which I did | The Lexus is the best value by many thousands of dollars | The car is a powerful smooth quiet ride if that is what you are looking for | My average speed around Sydney is 38 kph so top end performance is nice to brag about but not a decision maker | Add an extra year's warranty and a world rating of most reliable car and you have some very good reasons for buying an IS250 | It exceeds the brief |

 "words": Very nice refined car | AWD model accelerates fine | Very nicely finished interior | The rear seat is tight but I knew this when I made the purchase | It was hard to find a model with the Luxury Package | Would not have purchased the car without that package | This package is what makes a Lexus a Lexus | On the other hand the navigation system is not acceptable | A passenger cannot program the system while the car is in motion does not announce street names is very complicated to program | Do not waste your money on this inferior system | Instead purchase a 300 | 00 portable navigation system | They are easy to program have Text to speech and have traffic updates | 
 "words": Full disclosure I am an engineer with 20 years of quality experience so I am very picky | This car is the perfect marriage of luxury and sports car | The build quality is very apparent both inside and out | It is extremely quiet and smooth although the suspension is a tad stiff on rougher roads | The paint is absolutely beautiful | Picking a color is the toughest decision once you decide to buy | The engine will not impress true sports car enthusiasts but I think Lexus hit the nail on the head by combining very good performance with great gas mileage | I'm getting 28 MPG consistently | 
 "words": Smooth ride very mature looking car | Factory Body kit adds a nice touch to it Get the factory xm tuner box if yours doesnt have it for a clean and invisible footprint | It interfaces with the touch screen | All the wires are waiting for it | Save yourself the 900 installation cost if you are someone who isn't afraid of d | i | y and the plastic christmas tree panel clips Uses premium gas but not a guzzler | 
 "words": I bought this car about 5 days ago after deciding to trade in my 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe due to rising gas prices | I agree with several other peoples posts in regards to test driving this car just wasn't enough | After 5 days of owning this car I can honestly say that it is AWESOME | I commute in the Bay Area everyday and this car is by far the best I could have bought | The gas mileage is great the luxury features are wonderful and the car looks drives like a dream | Please keep in mind that I came from a 6000lb SUV to this small Lexus sedan | I was very worried about the drastic change in vehicles and that I wouln't like being in a sedan | I have 0 buyers remorse and don't miss my SUV at all | 
 "words": I just bought my IS250 1 week ago and so far it's been great | I have heard some complaints on how the initial pick up is lagging some but I have yet to feel inadequate upon take off | It's a smooth ride and really fun to drive | The navigation system takes a little getting used to it's really just a matter of getting the lingo down | I have the tan interior which tends to get dirty rather quickly but the perma-plate guard that they put on seems to be keeping the dirt off | The only thing I can complain about is the slightly small back seat but hey i'm not sitting in the back | and the blind spots | Other than that I love it | 
 "words":  I traded in a 2005 Acura TL for the Lexus | I feel like I've from cream to halfhalf | Don't get me wrong this is a very good car and it was the AWD at a reasonable cost that sold me | The interior is beautifully well crafted but not as ergonomically friendly as the Acura | You feel more road irregularities but if were expecting not to you bought the wrong car | My biggist gripe and I hate to keep comparing the TL is the Manual Sport shift | Nowhere near as seamless as the Acura | Even worse is when you move your shifter over into that mode the default gear is 4th rather than the gear you were in | Pretty abrupt if your in 6th which this car has you in most of the time | 
 "words": Bought the car a week and a half ago and really like what the car has to offer | Test drove a 335i sedan infiniti g37 and an acura tl and tl type s | Went with the Lexus due to interior quality and richness and value compared to the bimmer | Coming from an Acura TL the learning curve on using the nav system is huge | Toyota Lexus can learn quite a bit from how Honda Acura has implemented their nav interface | Drives like a charm although I wish the steering would tighten up a bit at highway speeds | It would be nice to deactivate VSC and TCS while driving instead of bringing the car to a stop first | There is definitely room for improvement on the car | Fix the nav operation add mem seats | 
 "words": Purchased this car because I needed an AWD vehicle but did not want an SUV | Test drove the Audi A4 but went with the Lexus b c of reliability | This car is fun to drive and has made my commute more enjoyable | It needs more power | In the Power mode it's a dream but in regular mode it's quite sluggish | The ride itself is smooth and the interior is comfortable | I'm getting used to the brakes I'm used to pressing the brake and coming to an immediate standstill the brakes on the Lexus tend to glide a little more | The back seat is small but my 2 kids age 9 and 3 don't seem to mind | Handles like a dream | Fuel economy is great | I love it | 
 "words": I was very impressed with the drivability of this car compared to the BMW and I'm looking forward to lower maintenance costs than my BMW or Audi | Comfy ride yet still good road feel so I know what's going on | Nice and quiet | Smooth transmission even with performance driving | Paddle shifters are convenient and give confidence when performance driving | Heated and cooled seats are very nice | 
 "words": I've had this car for 1 month and it's been a blast to drive | I really like the interior and exterior styling and it has a very smooth ride to it | I looked at the G-35 and BMW 325 but you get more for the dollar on the lexus IS 250 | Never really paid attention to Lexus before but this is a great quality car | 31 | 7 MPG highway and 26 mixed | A 15 min test drive is not enough as I had to go back to drive it again | It took me several days to get used to driving this car | 
 "words": I just purchased by IS 250 two days ago and I love it | I traded an 07 Acura TL but I drove the Mercedes C300 Audi A4 and VW Fahrenheit GLI | Glad I chose the IS 250 even though the horsepower is lacking and doesn't compare to the TL I had | I got an excellent deal on this car and the base model is loaded with everything I needed | I did get one with HID 18 tires and upgraded rims and a few other items | Drive it and you'll want one for sure |

 "words": I purchased this car a week ago what a fun car to drive | It handled extremely well in the snow AWD is great | I love the leather seats smart key radio | Paddle shifters are fun | Handles unbelievably | However the experience that has been awsome in everyway was dissipated when i found out that several nav system available while the car is parked become inaccessible when the car is in motion | In the name of safety according to lexus | If I were to agree that lexus can be my mother I resent paying 2600 for a system that is literally crippled in my mind when the vehicle is motion | Save yourselves the money get the car without nav and by a 100 3rd party nav system instead | 
 "words": The handling on this car is great | It is very reliable and stable at high speeds | The interior is a bit small but feels and looks luxurious | The horsepower is too low it is missing that extra kick at acceleration | The standard audio system is bad quality | my Bose system in my 96 Maxima was 100 better | The bass is very weak and listening to music became a nuisance in this car | The car makes a weird sound from the rear passenger wheel which I told was normal | Overall the car operates a bit noisy | The IS 250 is a nice car but I feel I could have gotten a better deal for the money spent |

 "words": I just bought this car | Styling leather seats radio all creature comforts are great | Do not buy this car if you do not like the ride and feel of low profile tires | The ride is bumpy on the highway and I can feel every uneven road surface and pothole | I'm very disappointed with my purchase | A 10 15 minute test drive was not enough time to get the true feel of this car | 
 "words": I'm not suffering a second of buyer's remorse | The car is a kick to drive it is loaded with features and everything about is pleasing to the senses I find myself just touching various surfaces and marveling at how perfect they all seem | It's tempting to think of the IS as a budget Lexus | That may have been true of the 300 but this is genuinely a luxurious car all Lexus | I'm getting about 32mpg on the highway and mid-20s around town | Much better than the new EPA ratings | 
 "words": I test drove this car expecting to not be impressed and I was completely wrong | It looks great feels great is very luxurious and has a lot more pick- up speed than the 250 suggests | I couldn't believe what the base model came with | The comperable BMW didn't even have leather and you had to pay a significant amount more for basic features | 
 "words": Excellent car | Really hugs the road quick acceleration not as peppy as the 350 but enough for a 36 year old | I was in the market for a Certified Pre-Owned 2006 or 2007 and ended up getting a new one for a few thousand more | Tells me they keep their resale value moreso than others I compared it to | 
 "words": I looked at the Mercedes c300 first but opted for the IS 250 instead | I have owned the IS 250 for 2 months now and the car is fun to drive | The 250 does get good gas mileage also | Rear seat legroom is minimal | One drawback is the paint | Already chipping on the front | I've owned other cars for years before the painted started to chip |

 "words": Wonderful car all around | I added the HID headlights XM radio vent seats and wood trim | The base models come pretty well loaded | While not a pure sports car it has found a perfect balance between luxury and sportiness | The ride is as quiet and smooth as can be | When you test drive it be sure to take in on some bumpy roads | You will feel the difference | I am 6'1 and still fit comfortably into the front seats | No one can fit into the back seat behind me though | The trunk while not very big was able to fit my ice hockey goalie equipment | I also test drove the Mercedes 300 BMW 325XI loaded '08 Honda Accord V-6 Coupe among others | In my opinion the best value for your money | 
 "words": Before this purchase I was also researching the Acura TSX | The Lexus got me hooked | Great ride good power and awesome styling | There is nothing on the road that looks like it | A lot of standard features including high ticket safety items that are optional on other makes | 
 "words": I just purchased an 2008 IS 250 and I love the car | Me being 16 I love any car but this car is so fun to drive and it is very comfortable | I installed the spyder wheels and the billet grille which i highly reccomend | 
 "words": For the price of a base it's a great overall value for a luxury vehicle | I purchased only the leather package with automatic | Handles well lovely interior doesn't feel like plastic which is important for me | I take clients out in this vehicle with good overall feedback | Base sound system is decent includes as base a 6CD changer | Previous car was a Acura 3 | 2TL with a premium package | only difference I've found is that the Lexus handles better smaller and maneuvers like a small car | 
 "words": I can't say I've ever owned a BMW or Audi though I have driven them so take note | I can say however that I love the IS 250 AWD | Looks great on the inside and the outside and drives well too | It may not be the 500HP BMW M5 but it has zip and the handling is phenomenal | The fuel economy is a bit on the low side at about 22MPG for my driving | In extended highway driving even avg | 90MPH I've gotten the avg | up to 27 | 5mpg so I think that the 26MPG is a bit low | No complaints so far | except that it's too damn much fun to drive | 
 "words": I love everything about this car | The base model is loaded and I only upgraded the wheels headlights and added a spoiler | I purchased the Matador Red and it's just sexy | I look forward to my drive to work now | 
 "words": I shopped and test drove all the entry level luxury models in this category G35 C280 3 Series | I previously owned the Lexus SC 300 and Infinti G35 coupe but this IS 250 is best car ever | Drive it and you wont sleep until you own one | Such a nice balance between sport styling and true lexus comfort | 
 "words": Had an Audi that was about to bite the dust thing was an absolute money pit | Fortunately our other family car was a Lexus RX and we've had nothing but a stellar Lexus ownership experience so when I decided to buy another AWD car the IS 250 AWD had to be on the list | The car has not disappointed | Handles beautifully looks good plush inside and best of all it's a Lexus so you know build quality and ownership experience will be top notch | Get the nav package w Bluetooth and rearview camera worth every penny | 
 "words": I test drove every car in this price range and the Lexus made my decision so easy | It comes with many features in the base model that other cars you pay extra for like 6 CD changer iPod adaptor sunroof leather premium sound smart key | I got the base model because I felt like it was already very loaded | It handles so smooth and tight | My previous car was a 330i BMW and there is no comparison | My BMW had the premium package and still was not as loaded as the base model Lexus | 
 "words": Do not test drive it unless you wanna bring it home that night | I'm serious | I went into the dealership just to check out pricing and test drive it then spent the next couple hours figuring out how I can afford the payments | It was that easy | Smooth smooth ride very quiet nice stereo system and paddle shifters when you want that manual tranny feel | Leather is so soft and vented seats a nice touch | Real fun to drive | Get looks from many people as I drive by | 
 "words": Before purchasing I drove the BMW 3 Series Mercedes C 350 Sport Infiniti G35 Audi A4 and Acura TL-S | The C 350 was the only car in class that can hold a candle to this car in all-around characteristics | The IS 250 in the 6 speed manual gives you the performance that you're looking for | While other cars in the class will be slightly faster none had as nice of a feel in shifting and ride comfort at the Lexus | 
 "words": Bought this car a couple of weeks ago | Love it to death | Quite smooth and have great fun of driving | I went through BMW 3 G35 Lexus absolutely is my right choice | Don't drive it if you don't want it | I repeat do not drive it if you are not ready to own |
