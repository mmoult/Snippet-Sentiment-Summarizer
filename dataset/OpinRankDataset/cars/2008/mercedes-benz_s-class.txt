REVIEWS
 "words": I knew the S600 was perfect when I was at my local Mercedes Benz dealership here in Houston | My wife loved it and the kids 8 and 16 love it also | My teen girl really enjoyed the vanity mirrors while it was nearly impossible getting my son out of the reclining rear seats | My wife enjoyed the fact that she could read and drive I would never commend this action in stop-and-go traffic due to the very intuitive Distronic Plus System | The COMMAND system was overwhelmingly easy and the car overall was extremely comfortable | I have owned a Jaguar XJ Super V8 and a 2003 Bentley Arnage but they pale in comparison to this big Benz due to the way it effortlessly combines luxury and technology
 "words": As a total package the 2008 S550 sets itself apart from all the super luxury sedans under 100K | I've owned many performance cars CL500 Porsche 911's BMW 7 series Lexus LS430 etc | The S550 by far is the most comfortable and pampering vehicle in its class | It has a perfect balance through purposeful engineering between performance and comfort it's a well appointed family room on wheels | I'm in total agreement with MB's design philosophy understated luxury as it is a true way to reflect the owner's sophisticated taste without overstating his her presence | The S550 is a remarkable automobile | 
 "words": I have owned many new cars incuding 9 new Sclass mercedes | I purchased a new 2007 through my local dealers European delivery program | What a blast | The hotels they were incredible | But the hotels paled in comparison to driving the new S Class on the Autobahn | My wife and I both loved that car so much that the following year we went back to Germany and got another one | Well you guessed we are going back for our third one in August 2009 | As long as Mercedes keeps making a car of this quality with such a high retained value I am In | 
 "words": This is a very beautiful car | Not the best but nice | Really the best on the market right now but not sure that says a lot | S550 best of a choice for the current market when compared to the Quattroporte 7 Series A8 | Cars I wish it came close too the driving feel and comfort of my 2001 740iL or the elegance of my 2006 Range Rover | I have had it to the shop twice for TPMS and a tire that kept going flat | 
 "words": I had this car for a 7months | This car has the best utilization for a super car | I considered Porsche 911 turbo Audi R8 and Ferrari F430 but with a family those cars are unacceptable | Considered Alpina B7 but shaky reliability and it being non-factory car I disqualified it from my list | I opted for S65 AMG for performance and 4 door convenience | I have not regretted choosing this over Porsches or Ferraris | Until Porsche Panamera or Ferrari comes with a four door sedan this car has no competition | Plus reliability wise MB is a far better choice | For now this is the only choice for supersedan | 
 "words": I just traded in my 2007 S550 bought March 2006 with 24000 miles on a new 4matic with almost every option list 107k | Obviously I loved my 2007 or would not have bought the 2008 | There is a big difference in both the driving and mileage of this one versus my 07 | The new one is both 4matic and has the AMG appearance package | It drives more like a BMW but gets much less gas mileage than the 2 wheel version | By the way my old one had no reliability issues during the 2 years of ownership | 
 "words": Had every generation of MB S class since 1991 | This one by far is the best one ever | I can't truly comment on reliability yet since its still a new car | But so far no problems | The drive and the features of the car are great | Plenty of power for everyday driving | If you're a racer you should be looking at AMG models | Gave the fuel economy an 8 | It drinks gas like water but not uncommon for V8 | Think there is definite room for improvement though | Cross shopped against BMW 7 series | Choose this model due to the 7 series getting a model revision very soon | 
 "words": This car is all you would expect from Mercedes Benz | Economy is much better than advertised | 25 on the highway at 80 MPH | Comfort is awesome handling is great and interior layout was well thought out | 
 "words": After having a couple of MBs with quality issues we are extremely pleased with the rock solid problem- free S550 we have now had for several months and 3000 miles | We waited 6 months to get an S with the ABC option but ABC provides such a great combination of ride and handling that it was worth it | COMMAND is very easy to use I have never opened the manual and allows for a dash that is free of button clutter particularly compared to Lexus LS | You can get gas mileage well into the 20's on the highway but it can degrade to below 15 mpg in urban driving | But you feel so great in this vehicle that you hate to have to get out when you reach your destination
 "words": Much better in in aspects then my 04 S430 | By far the best under 100k Luxury Sedan | The car adapts to your driving style | How the new Consumer Reports can rate the Lexus LS higher is beyond me | It takes a bit to get used to the new COMAND yet after that you will never want to go back to plastic push buttons again | How on earth could anyone think the controls are difficult to use unless they never used a computer mouse in their lifetime | I am picky and looked at all in this class and very satisfied with my purchase | European Luxury Sedans just have better road feel than the Japanese | The S Class has more steel interior parts than Lexus LS is just a better handling car |

 "words": Is it possible to have luxury comfort superb build quality and safety in one car | Yup | Oh you want performance too | Well this is the one to get | I'm comparing the S63 to other cars I've owned NSX SL600 2 Vipers several Corvettes S500 SL55 AMG and the S63 rules | 
 "words": My husband has been a Mercedes-Benz afficianado for decades but I have always bought whatever car I thought looked the best which has led me to Audi and BMW many times over the years | Those vehicles were very enjoyable to own but were hopelessly unreliable | I just purchased a new car following my husband's advice he has an S550 himself and have never been this pleased with a car | The S is so refined and luxurious I can hardly fathom how I lived without it all this time | This truly is the best luxury sedan available today | So far it is completely problem free and it has that bank vault solidity to it I am so enamored with this car | 
 "words": New for '08 it's exhaust is tuned to rumble | It's too noisy on acceleration and constantly hums in the rear compartment | I have an '07 S550 which gets 26 | 6 mpg on the highway | This S63 gets 18 mpg if you keep the speed at 70 | Otherwise mileage drops dramatically | Acceleration is awesome | The car starts out as a jack rabbit and turns into a missle | Before you know it you're doing 60 mph in a 30 speed zone and 90 in a 65 | The interior is a superb improvement over the last generation | The dash is beautiful | The COMAND has 4 ways to get to a function making it user friendly | 
 "words": This car is absolutely fantastic | Everything about the car exudes quailty and hand built craftsmanship | The touch of the control buttons the steering the road grip with not a hint of body roll at any speed I've traveled so far The AMG leather is better than in the 600 and the seat comfort is unmatched with almost limitless adjustments | opperating the many features is easy and nearly intuitive through the command control or one of the redundant feature buttons | I havn't been able to pull the 4 | 5 sec | 0-60 times reported only able to get it to 6 | 3 ironic but I am not a professional driver and haven't managed to time my shifts correctly yet | Either way the car is a blast to drive |
