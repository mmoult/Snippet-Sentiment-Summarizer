REVIEWS
 "words": Bought the Avalanche to replace my Silverado | Couldn't be happier except I can't get my wife out of the Avalanche | Got the White Diamond package with 22 wheels | Took it to the car wash last week and when finished the young man asked for the owner and another customer said he wished it was his | Two of the young men wiping it down mentioned what a sweet ride I had | Drove from Utah to Texas and back fully loaded and averaged over 20 mpg at over 70 mph | Extremely comfortable ride on the open road | The folding steps are great | I'm over 6' tall and my wife is 5' | the adjustable pedals and memory seats make the truck a joy for both | Almost a year and a half and no visits to the shop | 
 "words": This is the ideal truck for business that includes taking clients to the field | It travels superbly and gets better than 18 mpg if driven 65-70 mph | MPG drops quickly if over 70 | The only complaint is its ground clearance which has resulted in some scrapes to the wheel well corners | not noticeable but it would be nice if it rode about 2 higher | I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who can afford it although its value to me has far exceeded the pick-ups I have had in the past | I will drive an Avalanche LTZ as long as GM can afford to make 'em | 
 "words": I traded in a 2003 Dodge Ram QuadCab- Laramie edition that I purchased new for a Chevy Avalanche LTZ with Rocky Ridge customization package | I had visited several dealers in Hampton Roads VA and none had anything that met my needs | I found exactly what I wanted on eBay | My son and I drove over 400 miles Friday April 16 2009 and traded in our old Dodge and bought the new Chevy Avalanche LTZ | The truck in white diamond pearl white with customization package makes it look just like the Escalade | 
 "words": I am a lady that bought this as a surprise for my husband | I love it so much that I'm probably going to buy one for me next year | I love the rear assist camera heated seats and power retractable steps | I was a previous Camry owner and I've never owned an American car before | If this truck lasts for 10 years like my Toyotas I'll never buy another foreign car again | I am super impressed with the Chevy Avalanche | 
 "words": I was t-boned on driver's side other guy going about 50 | Walked away from my 2007 Avalanche | Side bags saved my life as did the vehicle | Avalanche was totaled as was F250 diesel that hit me | Cops said Avalanche saved my life without question | Bought a new 2008 LTZ | Can't say enough about how great both have been | Not a problem on either one | Had a 2004 Deville and these trucks ride and perform as well as the Caddy | If class quality ride safety and good looks are important then this is your vehicle | I can't stress how great I feel with all the safety features built into this truck | 
 "words": This is the smoothest most comfortable versatile truck in the world | I bought a new LT last year and dad and I made a trip up to WI | from Florida | He couldn't believe it was a pick up truck | It truly has a better ride than my wife's Cadillac | The storage is awesome and abundant and the cabin is as comfortable as sitting in a lazyboy in your living room | The only thing I don't like is that my wife likes it better than her new Caddy so it looks like we will probably have 2 of them in the near future | You can really dress these trucks up too if you're in to that | Chevrolet never seems to advertise these trucks | If they knew what they were doing they would put everyone else out of business | 
 "words": I chose the LS model for two reasons first it was a few thousand dollars cheaper and second it had the 40 20 40 split bench which I like better than the bucket seats that are the only option in the pricier LT and LTZ models | I really like this truck | It is a no-compromise crew cab essentially a Tahoe from the rear seats forward that is easy to get into I seldom even bother with the running boards but then I'm 6'3 my wife who is 5'2 uses the running boards and has no problems getting inside | The performance is excellent | Using the midgate I can haul an object as big as a full sized couch with the rear seats down | I got 21 | 8 MPG on a recent road trip hard to beat that | 
 "words": We've been eyeing an Avalanche for years now and finally bought one with the employee pricing in Sept '08 | Interior is very impressive and the ride is suprisingly smooth for a truck | The climate control knobs could be easier to use when driving and a coin holder would be nice | Backing up is tough but the park assist helps a lot | Everyone who rides in the truck comments about how nice the ride is even other truck owners | Gas mileage is almost exactly the same as the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee 6cylinder we sold to buy this | We avg 15 | 5 mpg and could do better if we tried to use 4cyl mode more often | 4WD engagement is seamless | 
 "words": Nothing beats this vehicle for flexibility functionality performance and comfort | An awesome combination for an active family of four | Averaging almost 19 overall with typical NJ suburban traffic | Overall extremely satisfied with the entire package best truck I have ever owned | Thanks Chevy

 "words": For those who don't need a truck all the time but need one occasionally the Avalanche is a perfect fit | It is built on a Suburban frame so it rides much more smoothly than a truck | The bed can be made into an 8 footer and makes a great bed for camping trips with the seats folded down | Very good build quality | GM makes good trucks and SUVs my previous vehicle was a Tahoe |

 "words": Wow | Can't say enough about this truck | Was considering the Tundra 4dr 4wd | But that would have cost about 5000 more plus a cover | If you take my price and compare it to what I would have gotten if I'd gone Toyota you'd be amazed | The Avalanche has a better interior and a better ride not as stiff | The utility is also better as the seats can be folded or the cover stored | It may not be as fast as the Tundra but if you are doing hwy miles you should get this | I traded in a 1998 Toyota | I'm impressed | No problems yet | I also like the oil filter drain set- up | Much better than the competitors if you do it yourself | 
 "words": What is the Avalanche a pick up truck an SUV a motorcycle hauler a comfortable long range cruiser a technical wonder | The answer is all of the above | The Avalanche does so many tasks with ease | I load with people some times or haul one of my motorcycles in the back or both | The LTZ with the auto leveling suspension handles that with grace | This is my second Avalanche as I had a 2002 when I was living in NH | Both have were totally dependable with no issues what so ever | to be expected from an American car I know | The 08 with this advance handling and suspension is a dream to drive in very slippery conditions | Buy one you won't regret it | 
 "words": Well it has been about a year since I bought this vehicle | I have even nicer things to say than when I had just acquired it | This is a very dependable comfortable powerful luxurious SUV that also is a truck | And you can write the whole thing off on your taxes because it is over 6000 pounds and it is technically a truck | Buy American and feel good about it | Less costly than Toyota or others out there | Chevy will deal | I got the extended warranty but don't think I'll need to use it much | this is a very reliable vehicle | 
 "words": I have owned several GMC crew and extended cabs and a Yukon but this Avalanche really does have it all | I have the Z71 package which I think gives it a little better look | The side locked storage is great as well as the looked tailgate with a water tight cargo area | Smooth as a nice car yet tough as a truck | Truly has it all | The more I learned about it after I bought it the more I liked it | This Avalanche is like home to me so comfortable | 
 "words": I love this truck and yes I'm a girl | I just bought my Avalanche after months of looking around and comparing other SUVs and trucks | Overall I really liked the Avalanche's versatility as an SUV truck combo | I must say though that Chevrolet's use of the White Diamond exterior paint is what put me over the top | This truck is absolutely gorgeous the cashmere leather interior and the 20 chrome wheels chrome accents really make this truck a showgirl | If you are looking to purchase an Avalanche I suggest you spring for the LTZ package | You won't be sorry you did | All the extra features are really nice and make the whole driving experience enjoyable | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Avalanche | Have had an 02 and 04 | Bought an 07 Silverado and didn't like that at all | Only had around 9000 miles when I got rid of it | The Silverado got the worse gas mileage I have ever gotten with one and have had them for years | So was able to go back to the truck I love | It is so versitle | Can fit sheets of plywood and drywall in without issues at all | The storage areas are great as well | There is so much room that everyone can travel in comfort | Drove straight through to FL one year and put a futon mattress in the back folded the seat down and the kids had all the room they needed along with all the luggage | Has to be the best product GM has come out with |

 "words": I traded a 2007 Nissan Titan Crew Cab LE in on this vehicle hands down this is a far better vehicle | It's rides and handle better than the F-150s I have own and for me to say this about a Chevy this is really saying something | What else can I say a great vehicle with great flexability | 
 "words": I thought long and hard before buying this vehicle | I compared it to the Cadillac EXT Toyota Tundra Ltd Ford F-150 King Ranch Dodge TD GMC 2500 Duramax TD w Allison6spd | In the end all those other vehicles were just trucks | If what you really want is a truck then buy the GMC or the Tundra in my opinion | If what you want is really a very nice SUV with lots of bells whistles that also doubles as a pickup truck then the Avalanche is for you as it was for me | I have every toy you can get on this LTZ and I suggest you either get the LTZ or the LT3 w Z71 | No LTZ ride leveling on the LT3 though | No 4x4 in the Caddy available |

 "words": I traded a 2003 Z71 for a 2008 Z71 | Many improvements all for the better | This is a very dependable vehicle but components do go bad | There are so so many that make it perform like it does I can't say enough good things about the 2008 Avalanche Z71 | It is a go- getter | Although a little pricey the astute buyer can do his homework and negotiate smartly and save some money |
