 "words": My wife and I got this Jeep for 12700 | NEW off the lot with 62 miles on it | We have the 2 | 4L with a five-speed | We heard the CVT was a turd and are very happy with a manual | my wife hates it but I turn of the traction control and pull the parking brake roll and smoke the front tires all day long | I don't like the styling its too round but its my wife's car and she loves it | The transmission had to be replaced after 10000 miles it was not do to my abuse but because of the syncro for 5th gear exploding on the freeway | We get on avg 28mpg with a mix of 50city 40highway 10idling I idle alot waiting on my wife while she is inside the store shopping and I'm sleeping in the Jeep | 
 "words": Our 2008 Compass Sport is an extremely nice well featured vehicle | esp | when considering what we paid out-the- door for it 16400 | The interior catches way TOO much flak from reviewers | It is roomy and the seats are very comfortable | Gas mileage is good 4 people luggage A C on 75 mph produced nearly 26 mpg on a recent trip | No A C and under 65 mph pushed it up over 30 mpg | It's been reliable and only had one warranty repair for a couple of suspension bolts in nearly 20k mileage | As far as performance | all you have to do is put your foot down on the accelerator a bit more firm and get the RPMs up | That's it | The 172 HP does the rest | Highly recommend for 
 "words": This is a good SUV | The only real problems I have encountered are the huge blind spots on the sides between side windows and windshield | Also whenever I open the doors after it has snowed all of the snow plops into the front seats | Also the automatic locks drive me crazy | 
 "words": I Love driving my Red Jeep Compass | I am an over 40 woman and drive to and from work | I like simplicity | Leather seats are not for me especially in Florida | I love the fabric upholstery because it is cool and supportive | Since I am short I love that I can raise the drivers seat and I am not sitting in a hole | The power is plenty and I can easily pass other cars when needed | Driving this car is fun and easy and there are no blind spots to worry about | 
 "words": The jeep compass is an overall ok vehicle Its design is sleek nice but the quality of the mini SUV needs to be worked on especially with the constant stalling cutting out etc | but i'm still luvin my lil JEEP
 "words": Great suv great mileage very roomy vehicle my family is very comfortable in this vehicle and a fun vehicle to drive 45 minute back and forth to work
 "words": Whilst this vehicle is a very nice vehicle to look at the quality of the interior is terrible | My wife's car is just over a year old and the plastic skirting on the front chair has snapped off | The storage panels on both front doors are beginning to break off | Overall very cheaply made interior | About the only good thing going for this vehicle is the good gas mileage | If this is how jeeps are being manufactured now then this will be the last one that I purchase | 
 "words": Is a fairly comfortable ride somewhat fun but stalls out in the morning hours | Currently have a computer installed on the car to try to find the problem | I'm hoping my family does not get hurt in a car accident cause by the car stalling out | Might have to sue the dealer and Chrysler | 
 "words": My father just bought this car | We both thought that for the price it was a good buy | How disappointed we both were | In fact so disappointed that after exactly 9 days we returned the car | The interior is horrible | Looks like a cheap fake toy car | Buttons are poorly built | No interesting options i | e | USB connections etc nothing Though the car has only 4 cylinders it consumes way more than the design info states | The fact that for this price it 4 wheel drive is not standard is shocking especially when compared to others like the Grand Vitara for 2 k more than the compass or the Tuscon or less or the same price as the compass
 "words":  I've had the Compass for 15 mos | and have not gone back to the dealer for anything | I have the 5 spd | manual as I prefer that with a 4 cylinder | Long trips give me 28-30 mpg's while my rural driving returns 27 mpg's | Seldom do city driving | I use the Compass for errands fishing and hunting with dog | Therefore the cheap plastic interior is just fine and easy to keep clean | No regrets buying the Compass | 
 "words": I wanted to get a car that was SUV- like but gets good gas mileage | This car does that wonderfully | I get an average of 27 mpg and still have comfortable room for passengers and a fair amount of storage space in the back | It rides higher up and has plenty of leg room | I bought a standard transmission and I love the way it shifts gears | Very smooth | 
 "words": I got it in Oct 2008 and I like it seeing how I own 1 other jeep before it runs very good so far I can not say that I like the way or how the sales people push it on me I would change a lot about the way Cary auto park does there thing and have a lot of bad things to say about them but I do like the Jeep compass over all | 
 "words": Overall not bad quiet ride | like the limited accents Seat belt reminder chimes every 8 seconds | CVT can be noisy at times | Should be undercoated from factory rust after 1 PA winter
 "words": We have put almost 4K miles on our Compass and love it | This is my 2nd Jeep previously had a Grand Cherokee | This jeep is perfect for what we use it for | Seats are comfortable the ride is good and power is acceptable with the manual tranny | I have grown to love the looks of the Jeep | The build quality appears to be very good as well | The reviewers are way off on this vehicle | I would recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": We took a 2163 mile road trip and couldn't believe how smooth the ride was in such a small vehicle | The seat are at just the right height for age 65 to get in and out of | The best mileage 29 least 24 | The MPG computer was very accurate | I compare each fill up and follow the mileage | We never felt the transmission shift when going up and down hills | I could see the RPM going up but could not feel it shift gears | Amazing | It fits in the garage better and handles the roads with ease | This is my wife's car | Think I will get me one | I have to 2 | 0 engine | It has fine pickup | 
 "words": I was looking for a bigger car small SUV when I decided to trade in my 2004 Hyundai Elantra in June of '08 | I was intrigued by the new Dodge Jeep models and thought the Compass had such a unique look that I had to check it out | The first vehicle I test drove was the Dodge Caliber which was OK but didn't have enough 'oomph' with the 2 | 0 liter engine | Next was the compass and I fell in love with how it sits up higher and gives you more command of the road | I picked the Rallye Edition with the 18 tires and black rims with the YES essentials interior | This is huge for me as I have kids | For an SUV I can't complain about the gas mileage | It has plenty of room and a decent stereo to boot | 
 "words": So far this vehicle has been great I haven't had any complaints against it | I find it to be comfortable to ride drive in | I like the way it handles but I'm not a speed demon anyways | I read the Editor's reviews before purchasing and I don't have any regrets on buying this vehicle | 
 "words": Good car no problem so far the only thing is the lights come on when lock or unlock vehicle with the remote control kills the battery 
 "words": I just bought my 08 jeep compass 2 | 4L Rallye Edition in black with black interior and everyone ragged on me about getting a compass until I told them that I was getting the Rallye package | Now people are asking me where I got it and telling me how much they love it | The Rallye package sold me on it | It's no good without it | 
 "words": I wanted a SUV but I didnt want to pay the big bucks to own an SUV | So I bought the compass | Very quiet SUV | Gets good gas mileage nothing spectacular | When it goes to shift I actually cant hear it | My passengers have tried to listen for it but found it very hard to hear | The back seats are very roomy | I have no problem getting in with the seats all the way back and I'm 61' and 320 lb | Overall a great car to have | 
 "words": I have driven the car 1000 miles now and only one problem so far | Now and then it makes a whining noise for about a minute then goes away | This happens once a day | Has anyone else had this problem | Good gas mileage and fun to drive | A whole lot better than the 05 Equinox I traded in for it | 
 "words": I have had the compass for a month now and love it | Although I've only run one tank through it its my second vehicle | I got 26 mpg on the first tank and it ain't broke in yet 300miles on it total | I bought the plain jane nothing on it to brag about | No problems so far | Great vehicle for the money got the 250 cash back made it a 15000 vehicle talk about bang for the buck | 
 "words": Approaching 2 months and 2000 miles of commuting in Washington DC avg 23 | 5 MPG not bad for second worst traffic in the nation | CVT should be traded for Avenger's 4 spd auto even at expense of mileage | Love the overall driving position and utility | Wish there was less flash rough edges where hands spend most time steering wheel and gear shift handle | Wide a-pillar width is distracting when rounding curves | Adequate rear seat leg room but wouldn't want to sit on those seats for any length of time | Overall a competent beater but it's quirks probably give it the lifespan and legacy of an AMC Pacer |

 "words": I love the Compass | My husband and I are constantly back and forth between Champaign IL and Detroit MI and the ride is always smooth and comfortable | Not the best mileage but better than others | I love that we were able to add what we wanted of the Limited's features to our Sport and still end up at a great price | LOVE the bumper-to- bumper warranty | It's easy to get our 15-month old in and out as well and with the stain-resistant YES fabric we don't have to worry as much about spills and messes in a new car | 
 "words": 2008 Rallye Sport in black looks very sharp | Sticked for about 22500 but jeep gave me 2500 back a generous trade and I under 5 financing so | So far very good | Good pep with a 5 speed manual and good gas mileage 24- 28 is pretty accurate | GREAT Boston Acoustics sound system I have the 9 speaker system including flip down tailgate speakers | Interior look average exterior look pretty sharp | Handles and drives very well | Good roomy interior compared to my small sedan so | Drawbacks cheap looking dash but simple and logical | no MP3 jack on the 6 CD changer stereo | hatchback side windows don't crack open
 "words": Drove Chicago to Phoenix roundtrip no problems | Very comfortable seats let me drive 16 hrs straight | Lots of room good quality just what they should have been building all these years | 
 "words": A great Jeep I love the looks | Way better than the Honda CR-V that my cousin just bought | A great snow vehicle | A Compass owner for life | 
 "words": Really like the Compass | Very practical for children loading groceries and even pull a jet ski concept boat all summer to the lake behind it | So glad that I traded my Jeep Wrangler in for the Compass | 
 "words": The seats are excellent build quality is good no initial problems | The lifetime warranty is drivetrain only but for 2k I also got the bumper to bumper lifetime | Fun to drive roomy American made | Am going back to buy another for my daughter |

 "words": my car has problems it rolls back when on a hill at a red light or stop sign 10feet or more so i have to give it the gas fast | it also roll's forward when in park and turned off keys out so i have to be real fast to run after it get in and put my foot on the brake | i get no help from the dealer the car is unsafe to drive and they can't fix the problem | i was told he the owner quote he just sells them he doesn't build them end of quote | i was told to use the emergency brake all the time and be fast on the gas | thanks chrysler i didn't buy a standard | 61 years old and can run fast | 
 "words": It's nice to see an American car manufacturer doing what should have been standard in the industry 5 years ago | A smaller SUV with good fuel economy | Also a lifetime and I mean lifetime powertrain warranty | This vehicle rides better and drives better than my last SUV Ford Explorer | You can tell it's a Jeep by the extra safety features like ESP and anti-roll mitigation | Everyone that likes small SUV's should buy this model | I'm 6ft and 340lbs and can put the front seats all the way to the rear and I can still sit in the rear seats with my knees barely rubbing the front seats | And I love the shoulder room | 
 "words": We love to drive the Compass | Great use of space compared to the other SUVs we looked at | Lots of head room and rear seat room | The speed stick on the CVT is great | We do mix city highway drives with no problems | The tail gate is a bite noisy in the extreme cold -25c | 
 "words": The engine CVT is set for max engine performance not gas guzzling | Applying gradual pressure to electronic speed control pedal will give you the best acceleration | From take-offs and passing you will notice a difference | And for added speed try running RPMs up and then back off a little on ESCP | This is an analog input devise with no direct connection to throtle valves | Work with on board computer not against it | 
 "words": Quiet ride GPS easy to use Gas sticks around 20mpg due to it seems to have to hit 5rpm or higher to shift | 4x4 is actually AWD and only 4wd low | seats lay almost flat backwards for naps very comfortable for a Jeep | Very quiet on the highway and nice ride | Handsfree bluetooth will take over your phone call when you start the truck nice safety feature the caller can even hear you clearly and the people in the back seat too | GPS is fairly easy to use but the huge sound system is not as good as the base model radio due to a 3 band EQ with no sub adjustment | in the 4 fillups I've had max I've driven is 250 miles on 13 gallons been worse ever since |
