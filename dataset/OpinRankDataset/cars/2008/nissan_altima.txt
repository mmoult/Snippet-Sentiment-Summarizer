REVIEWS
 "words": We've owned our Altima since March of 2008 and haven't had one mechanical problem | It rides smoothly and quietly especially with the CVT transmission | The exterior is sporty looking but the paint chips easily | The Key has been nothing but problems | One of the buttons is already missing while the paint chipped on another one | Not to mention it always sets off the car alarm unintentionally | The interior is nice looking and the dash is well laid-out | It also looks nice lit up at night | There are plenty of cup holders but the plastics are cheap especially on the doors where they are all scratched and damaged after only a year | 
 "words": Having purchased a dealership test drive car with 3000 KM 1600 miles I benefited from my White Altima coupe 3 | 5 SE Premium being 'broken in' without being abused | Almost two years with the car now and I'm still taken by the beauty of the interior and exterior design | I'm in snowy Calgary Canada and appreciate the foul weather control of front wheel drive | I consider the Altima coupe to be a great balance of performance comfort style and practicality | A well designed car that sacrifices little and offers a lot | 
 "words": I have a 2008 Altima SE V6 and this is by far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had | I downsized from a 2007 Infiniti M35 those seats were OK | Before I bought the Altima I had read several posts in Edmunds about uncomfortable seats on long drives and I should have listened better | It only takes 5 minutes and my back starts hurting | I do have back problems but this pain is different | It feels like there is no support in some areas especially left side | I have bought padded lumbar cushions but it did not help much | I would invest in custom seats if it would help but if not I am going take loss and get another car but what car in this class has superior comfort | 
 "words": I am really not happy with the ride of this vehicle my driving is mostly in the city and the vehicle does not take the pot holes various bumps that you find in most Cities | On the freeway the ride is very good | I had complained to Nissan Northern Regional in Canada and they referred me my dealership locally and they inspected the suspension system and said nothing was wrong with it that is how it was manufactured well I sort of expected tho to no avail | But on the more positive side the car is really a nice car nice styling and the engine is a little noisy but runs good it is too bad that it's suspension is not adequate to give a more comfortable ride overall | 
 "words": Before I saw the 2008 Altima my mind was set on a Camry but after seeing and reading about the Altima my mind changed | I had to have an Altima | I look forward to driving it each day | I love the keyless entry keyless start and the CVT transmission | No digging in my purse for the key | I have so much fun driving it | The gas mileage is awesome | Bottom line I love my Altima | 
 "words": Bought car 3 08 and now have over 16k | So far no trips back to the dealer | Getting 24mpg in suburban driving and averaging 30-31 highway at 70-75mph | Very happy with gas mileage with all this power | Continental tires have provided smooth quiet ride to go with extremely quiet engine which compliments a great sound system | Have found seats very comfortable for long drives | Gauges and buttons easy to use follow | Trunk plenty spacious and nice having fold down split rear seats | Worth having the leather seats heated works great and the other additional options like heated mirrors | Worth it | Debated between the 4 6 | Worth it to pay for the 6 for the quiet and powerful engine
 "words": I have owned this car for 10 months and it drove superb when I first purchased it but the Edmunds | com editor was correct when he says that the 6-speed manual transmission should be avoided | In the winter the gears began to grind crunch pop | I tried a dealer recommended synthetic oil and it helps slightly but even in the summer there is considerable gear grinding | Master clutch cylinder had silent recall | clutch pedal made reverberating socket-wrench sound until this was replaced | Nissan consumer affairs lacks technical knowledge and unhelpful and would not offer any suggestions to correct gear-grinding it seems to be a common problem so please avoid 6-spd and go with the CVT
 "words": I've always driven Nissans | My last car was a Maxima but I fell in love with the look of this Altima | The keyless entry is awesome especially when dealing with small children so you can have an extra hand rather than fumbling around looking for a key | I never thought I'd go from a V6 to a 4 cyl but the ride is real smooth and it still gets pretty good pick up | Haven't had any problems and never did with any Nissan I had | I put some chrome rims and grills on it and get compliments all the time on it | I'm definitely happy inside and out | 
 "words": My car 2008 Nissan altima 4 dr put 80k on my car | 2 days ago I was driving my car and it started on fire through my air filter I have never heard of that a car starting on fire through air filter they have my car now been waiting on what happened not happy with car so everyone be aware | They probably will be charging me with the damage to the car oil change every 3000 miles and all parts kept up to date | 
 "words": I've had my altima coupe for about a year now | LOVE IT | Haven't had any problems with it | Drives really wellnot good in the snow thobut its also not built to drive in the snow | good sporty cargood or 2 people-4 is pushin it with space | 
 "words": I've had about 10 weeks and 3623 miles in my fully loaded 3 | 5SE | Overall let me just say that I love my Altima | After A LOT of research spreadsheets comparing mpg leg room head room insurance costs etc I know I made the right decision | The 3 | 5 receives outstanding marks by Ward | s Best Engines | Performance is exceptional and the CVT took getting used to but now I have trouble going back to a normal auto | The Altima is comfortable and has great front leg room and rear leg room exceeds my | 03 Accord the BMW 5-series and MB E-Class | I have averaged 21 | 8mpg city and 29 | 4mpg hwy on a 1152 mile trip I don't drive slow | This means more room mpg and power than the E350 or 528i | 
 "words": You won't go wrong with this car | I drove all other major competitors and this one beat them in price and creature comforts hands down | I was skeptical of the CVT at first but I absolutely love it now | I am a big guy and fit in this car very comfortably | Go Nissan | 
 "words": Well I have had the car for about 2 months now | There are a lot of things I like and some I don't | I traded in a fullsize truck for this car so getting used to the smallness off the interior and the low ground clearance has been tough | Also the lack of comfort and the road noise | I live in Alaska so some of the roads aren't smooth | I do however like the gas mileage | I am getting a little more than 550 mi | On a tank | That's mixed | The interior fabric is cheap ultra suede | Cannot be cleaned | I don't like the cheap plastic interior | For the price it should be much nicer | Am not totally happy with the car and find myself wishing for something else |

 "words": The window sticker says 23-33 mpg the mpg gauge on the dash says 32 mpg highway and 23 mpg city but in actuality it only gets 21 mpg city and 26 mpg highway | These tests were done under very controlled fill up and driving conditions I was an engineering technician with GM Research Labs | Our 4cyl Camry did much better than this | We bought the Altima because it was a little smaller than the Camry and thought it would get better mileage | Consumer reports gives the 4cyl Altima 18 mpg city | Feel like we were scammed | 
 "words": When you put the heater on the foot only position the heat comes out mainly from the windshield defrost and not the feet | If you put the heat on the foot defrost position it performs the exact same function | My problem is I'm 410 and the defrost blows right in my face which is gagging me | My husband is 6 1 and it dries out his contacts | I have contacted 3 dealers and the manufacturer who say that is the way the car is made | My point is why have two buttons if they both perform the exact same function | No one can give me an answer to that so I'm stuck with this horrible heater blowing in my face | Also the face vents tilt but do not close so you have air hitting you from there too | 
 "words": 2 | 5 SL CVT with the connection package | I have never written a review for anything before but after all the helpful advise I read here before I purchased I had to return the favor | I cannot be happier with this car | Have owned 1 yr right at 17K miles still just as excited about it as when I drove it off the lot | Looked at Camry and Accord never even thought about this and then decided to check it out and something just stuck with me | Excellent performance for a 4 cylinder | Never been starved for power | Avg 27-29 mpg per tank with mixed hgwy and city and I don't hold back on the peddle | Smoothest transmission I ever felt | Love all the extras too | Great car for the money |

 "words": The Altima coupe has the best-looking backend of any car out there at any price | Look at it from the rear and a little to the side and its a joy to behold | The 4 cylinders get you up to speed without even trying | Back seat has more headroom slightly than the Scion tC and Civic coupe but a 6-footer's head might touch the rear window | Not sure about mileage | I'm still on the first tank but it seems fairly decent | Front seats are very comfortable with good driver's lumbar support | Driver's leg compartment is more comfortable than Civic coupe where the parking hand brake bothered my knee and more spacious than the Mazda 3 sedan that crowded my lower leg | A lot of quality for the money |

 "words": This car is awesome | It is my first automatic my first 4 door sedan and my first Nissan | I got it loaded 3 | 5 SE V6 Prem package and nav XM | IS 250 had too small of a backseat the 328i was out of my price range and I'm just not a Mercedes girl | I love to drive around with the windows down the sunroof open and the Bose speakers blaring | Perfect for those sunny San Diego days | The CVT engine is great but takes a little time to get used to if you are a manual transmission girl at heart like me | Overall a great ride | Previously owned a Ford and 2 Mitsus | What a difference | My friend has a 2008 G35 and this is basically the same car | All the same features and 10k less | Sold |

 "words": Okay so I have the 2 | 5S CVT 4 Door with Convenience Package | Great car smooth ride good gas mileage considering my lead foot | The 4cyl blew the doors off my friend 4cyl accord and picks up and hauls | The tires are GREAT in the rain but the large sidewall makes the performance during turns and quick maneuvers quite sloppy | The spoiler definitely makes it look classy | I had to have my door repainted fresh off the lot due to poor clearcoat application and discoloration of paint | I was quite upset | Now my window doesnt have auto up | Just down | I have had 2 Nissan prior to this and one Infiniti | I am disappointed that this car has had this many issues in less than 2500 miles |

 "words": This car is excellent and is a very comfortable family sedan overall | It handles extremely well in rain storms and any inclement weather | Heavy water on the roadway does not affect its traction nor does it pull on the steering wheel as it did on my 2005 Altima | The 6 cylinder is definitely not necessary as the 4 cyl acceleration is smooth and powerful | Though it is not as sporty to drive as the 2005 the turning circle radius is much better |
