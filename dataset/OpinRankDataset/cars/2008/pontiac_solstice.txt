REVIEWS
 "words": I love this car | 1 sexy machine with a huge hey BABY factor | I'm 50 and it makes me feel 16 again | Has every option available wicked fast even with the auto tranny and I've shown a lot of STUNNED 'Stangs and BMWs tire smoke and tail lights got the performance upgrade so it's hotter than the reg one and I had to buy a radar detector because I'm a very bad girl | Loved my Town Car but after driving TCs for a decade I wanted something HOT-smooth sexy curves and the adorable eager-to-run expression on it's little buck-toothed face makes me smile every time I see it | A real head-turner that folks swear must be an import and blazing speed to keep this old gal happy | I love him SO MUCH | 
 "words": This car is very well received at any local show and shines and parades that I have entered it in | I have never found that lowering the top is a problem | And I routinely complete the task in 15 seconds | Raising it is only slightly more time consuming requiring 28-30 seconds | The power window switches could have been better placed | I would have preferred wind up windows and side pockets | The cup holders I really could care less | A bigger trunk would be a great help for weekend touring | But with some creative packing two can go on a weekend cruise | I also do not require A C in a roadster and would have appreciated the weight savings and possible extra horse power | Stereo 1st class | 
 "words": After selling a Honda S2000 over year ago I decided to jump back into the vert world | The Solstice really wasn't in the running until I got the 3000 dollar coupon from my GMCard | I paid just over 16 | 5k for a brand new '08 with the wheel package Monsoon radio a must and a few other goodies | The car stickered at 26062 | An unbelievable deal and I'm pleasantly surprised with the ride handling and even the performance of the 2 | 4 ltr | The fit and finish is great and the materials aren't as cheap as I had expected from a GM product | This may just be the best car deal I've ever made | 
 "words": Magazine reviewers have lost the perspective of being an actual owner of the car | This car makes me feel 25 years younger and for the first time strangers actually look at what I'm driving | Even had a couple take a picture of it | It handles like better than any car I've EVER driven accelerates on a touch and stops evenly and when I want it to | For a big guy like me it's comfortable and reasonably roomy for a roadster that is | 
 "words": My wife and I each have one and they are toys for weekend use | Yes the guy who placed the switches should be shot but in spite of al the complaints from magazine types we can with thought place enough luggage for 2 for a 1 week trip | Just no big bags | There are plenty of storage slots if you look at it even with the top down | Mileage is way better than EPA says | We get 25 mpg in town on both cars | The top can be a pain but once you get a system it's pretty easy | It is a fun car and handling is great | Took mine to Phx In'tl Raceway's roadcourse and had a blast | yes the interior design team must have had a party the night before but the fun factor outweighs the negatives | 
 "words": With cat-like agility and blistering acceleration I just love my solstice gxp | While driving from San Diego to Las Vegas and staying fairly close to the speed limit which is difficult I actually got 33 | 1 mpg | As far as the manual top I can pop it down faster than most automatic tops | As far a putting it back up it takes a little more time but still its not that hard and I don't mind | Yes it does have animalistic head turning looks and yes it gets a lot of attention from the ladies who want to ride with me | Guys if you want a babe-magnet car with blistering acceleration and hurricane force winds with top down this is the beast i mean car to have | 
 "words": I have always been a lover of the Old Vets but have never been able to buy one | The solstice gives me the ability to afford a fun car to drive with out costing me a fortune | I love driving this car and enjoy the looks the people give me when I drive by | There is nothing practicle about this car but that is the reason I bought it | It looks great and is a lot of fun to drive | 
 "words": My father told me to buy an S2000 and my brother said Miata so I bought my Solstice | I have never enjoyed driving anything as much as I enjoy taking the top down and cruising in this | It is beautiful sporty roomy enough for what I wanted and most deservingly a head-turner | As for the car critics 'not enough room interior needs better styling needs more power and handling' don't get me started | If it were up to the major critical magazines and publications we would all be driving BMW's and Mercedes anyway | For less than 22K out the door with rebates and employee pricing I am fully satisfied and laughing at the Z4's and Kompressors | I think I'm gonna buy my wife the coupe | The top needs no improvement | I timed myself with no help other than my buddy pushing start on the stop watch | 10 seconds to lower the top 8 to put it back up | Tell me your automatic put-the-car-in-park tops can do that | 
 "words": This car is a blast to drive | Everyone stares at you like you are driving a spaceship | Never get tired of driving this car | Stereo is awesome | Speaker behind passenger seat will rock you for sure | I'm 57 and feel 16 when I get behind the wheel | The car is my wife's so I only get to drive on weekends | Should by another for me | 
 "words": We've got 3800 miles on our '08 GXP | It has gone through deserts an Idaho sand storm crossed mountains in flash- flood conditions and has shined in every situation | Two rebuttals on criticism 1 | Some critics say the manual tranny is rough and hard to shift | When broken in at about 3K it becomes butter-smooth | 2 | No storage space | Bull | You just need to know how to pack | I just took our GXP on a road trip to support a SWAT team's training operation | In the GXP I had a large camera bag tripod large duffel with a week's change of clothes gun bag laptop bag and ten blank-firing pistols rifles and a shotgun | Plenty of room for all | Treat yourself buy a GXP | 
 "words": I've been in love with this car months before the first '06 ever hit the road | It was the day before I was to pick up a pre-owned 2008 G6 GT I had just purchased when I was told I just received a pretty substantial pay raise | That was it it was finally my time | 4 days later I was driving home my Brazen colored Solstice | I love this car | This car is sexy as hell and IMO blows the Sky away in the looks department | It's a blast to drive and never fails to turn heads | My only regret is I purchased it with only a couple of months of driving days left before it gets put up for the winter | That's ok between employee pricing and end of season blowout they knocked 5k off the MSRP what a steal | 
 "words": In 4 weeks I now have 2800 miles | Car is too fun | Did a weekend trip to Laughlin NV and averaged 31 | 8 mpg | Noticed many people speed up to see my car almost as if they are trying to figure out what kind of car it is | Definitely this is a chick magnet | I love all the attention the women give me just for a ride | 
 "words": I drive a lake road to and from work every day it's like a road course this car is the most fun you can have with your clothes on | 
 "words": What a fun car to drive | I don't understand how the expert reviewers can rate the Sky higher than the Solstice | They are virtually the same car | This is a roadster therefore should not be considered a roomy car | It would be great if the top were powered instead of manual but it's not difficult to put up down | I would stop the car to put up down anyway | 
 "words": This small car always puts a smile on my face | It is a nice addition to my Harley | Fun for two | 
 "words": The 260 HP Solstice is the most addictive driving experience I've ever had | This car is like mainlining heroin to an auto enthusiast | Quick and agile but packing plenty of power and kick the Solstice GXP offers a visceral thrill unseen since the era of the mid-Sixties Corvette roadster | With XM radio On-Star and enough room in the trunk for an overnight bag the Solstice is the quintessential date car | I'm courting my wife all over again and we're having a blast rolling around the back county roads with the top down and a picnic lunch in the trunk | You can't miss with this Pontiac | Test drive it at your peril | You'll find yourself taking one home with no regrets | 
 "words": Got the 08 after seeing it on the road | Did my research first | Back cup holder OK with me | The driver side holder needs improvement | Plastic looks fragile | Airbag light too obvious on dash | Auto trans | works for me shifts great | Chrome grille would class it up | Would like a removable luggage rack for the back | Could have included door pockets but would sacrifice width | Perhaps a netting to hold odd and ends | Mirrors a little too small | Good sound system with 6 deck CD | My mistake was getting it for my wife | I don't like to beg | Put the SUV away until winter | 
 "words": Love the car and the way it handles | The red is a great color and the car gets a lot of heads turning | I have had so much fun driving this car with top up or down | All around fun to have | Have had no trouble out of this car | 
 "words": Wow Pontiac has excited me with this car | Its fun to drive and turns heads all my lady friends want to drive it | As well as it handles and is magnetized to the road its hard to let anyone but me drive it | I purchased the car knowing there wasn't much storage space in it | Didn't buy it for storage anyway as far as the cup holders wouldn't care if they were there or not | Glad theres not an ashtray gives me a reason not to let friends smoke in my car | 
 "words": The GPX is amazing | This is the first roadster that I have owned and I am very happy with my choice | The Solstice is the only car that I have been able to drive comfortably | I am a large person 6 ft 325 lbs with a very long torso | Other cars I have looked at did not have the hip room and head room that I needed | The Solstice has both | One other car I looked at had so little room I looked OVER the windshield when seated in the car and I could not close the door because it hit my leg | Other than being very comfortable in the Solstice it is really fun to drive | Other reviews complain about the meager trunk space all I can to say is this car was only meant for hauling well you know | 
 "words": I've had no problems with my Solstice | The transmission is the only drawback stiff to shift and poor choices in gear ratios | 
 "words": I just bought the solstice and I love it | The ride and handle is great | The inside a little cramped and the cup holders are in bad locations | Not much storage anywhere so don't go shopping on this car | But over all I love this car | 
 "words": My wife gave it to me for my 55th Birthday | I have owned 5 240 260 and 280 Z-cars | When you reach my age you either get a Harley a Sports Car or an exercise bike | I chose the Solstice | Nothing can touch it | it's fast feels like a million dollars and really gets the looks | Could not be more pleased | My other choice was 20K extra on a BMW | This beats the BMW hands down | 
 "words": i have hardly any regrets in buying this little jewel | there are some little quirks that i will address just because they are aggravating | the engineer that thought to put the radio power knob in the center of the radio where your hand hits it every time u shift into third gear must surely be proud | same goes for the mute power button radio controls on the steering wheel | their placement turns the radio or sound completely off when hit | side mirrors r way too small | but | this is a head turning car that turns heads | they r just trying to figure out what the colored streak is that just went zooming by | lol
 "words": Overall a very well performing car that handles darn near as good as a C6 Corvette maybe better in some respects | Fun and the exterior styling cannot be beat | Mechanically a very sound design | Interior needs work as far as convenience but if you rate it from a driving perspective only the interior is functional | As soon as you start adding niceties like where to put your spare change sunglasses or cell phone | the interior's shortcomings come to light quickly as does the non existent trunk space | The exterior design and performance of this vehicle is what sells | 
 "words": I just bought the GXP on my 60th birthday and it has totally jump started my life | I live in northern Minnesota but will use this care selectively all winter | You just can't store this one | It will although be in a slab heated work shop with me | I'll visit the wife on weekends if time permits | Thanks again Pontiac | 
 "words": The 2008 Solstice is a great car and fun to drive | This year the acoustic headliner 1 year of OnStar XM radio input jacks are all standard | The handling is also great with the Stabilitrac system | The exterior design is second to none | 
 "words": This is a great car | The handling is great no front end wandering takes corners like they are not there | The fit and finish are teriffic I worked in the auto industry for 30 years and know about fit and finish | Have always driven GM and had two bad cars when GM had the quality issues but those are gone and the product is now excellant | The styling looks good we have had comments of Cool car Good wheels Love your car from teens and adults | You can ride with the top down at highway speed and carry on a conversation and we do not have the opt | wind screen | With the top up wind noise is non-existent just the soft rumble of the exhaust | A pleasure to drive | 
 "words": An exceptional vehicle | Beautiful designbest GM has put together in a whileand always gets the looks | Simple with clean lines | Has that classic roadster feel | The car has plenty of pick up and power always wants to go | oh that turbo So easy to spin those tires | Has pretty solid handling | Storage could be an issue for some | Interior is like a cockpit | Clean in design | Cup holder placing is in an odd spotI dont use the 2 on the back wall | Stereo has great sound love the mp3 adapter | Seats on the GXP are great road trips have been really comfortablePack light | 
 "words": I purchased a red 2008 GXP last weekend | This car has a lot of potential with a few changes | Interior materials are ok but not up to the same standards as the MX-5 | Trunk space with the top down is non-existent | The manual gearbox should be improved to minimize the effort required to move between gears | The best way to describe it is clunky | Despite these drawbacks the car is a lot of fun to drive gets a lot of attention from admirers and is fast | 
 "words": My previous car was BMW Z4 3 | 0 | So far I really like the GXP's performance | The exterior is hot | My only beef with the exterior is the black grill it looks cheap | Why not keep the same chrome grill as the Solstice | The interior is sleek the seats hug you | However there is no storage space | I can't even find any place to keep my garage door opener | I've noticed that the window controls are in an awkward place inevitably my elbow triggers the windows | The biggest pain is the manual top miss the Z4's automatic top | There is no trunk space with the top down | Wish they offered navigation system as option | But can't beat the price and bravo to Pontiac for its cool design |
