 "words": I have had my Accent for over a year now I bought it when gas was near 5 | 00 a gallon | The car is great for running around town in but not so good on the freeway I am getting 26 and 32 MPG | I still like the car but it has some flaws | The 5 speed is a must but the clutch really takes some time getting use to the plastics of the interior are the worst I have ever seen scratch very easily the ride is quite and comfortable but you do feel most of the bumps and holes in the road | Reliability has been outstanding so far and still have no rattles | If your on a budget or looking for a cheep 2nd car then this is a good choice | 
 "words": We have owned the car for 1 year and almost every 2 months it is in the shop | The check engine light is always the engine is misfiring | Have had to coils replaced | They always say sometimes these things happen we'll get it taken care of | The car is 1year old should have no problems | I would seriously reconsider my options before buying this car | A bus is more dependable | Thank goodness for a second car | 
 "words": I bought this car to replace my aging '98 Saturn just under a year ago and it has been a great car so far | I was looking for basic transportation with a couple of extras and that's exactly what I got | With the Accent I get good gas mileage reliability freezing cold A C even on the hottest Texas days good looking body style girls tell me it's cute solid feel excellent warranty crazy tight turning radius XM radio LOVE the XM | ample room for my 5'8 self and all my camera equipment and I can almost pick it up and put it in my pocket after I reach my destination | My only complaint right now is the poor visibility in the hatchback when checking lanes before a lane change |

 "words": I bought my Accent to replace a 2000 Saturn that failed me only after not even a year | I drive over 100 miles a day and this has been a good car for that | I have had the check engine light on a couple of times for a random misfire but it goes out after a couple of starts I did have the dealer check this and they said it should be fine | I compared this with a Yaris and found the Yaris was more expensive considering the features and warranty | It is not the most comfortable car but again I drive a long distance each day | I would and have recommended this car as a cheap commuter though I could have gotten it even for less if I could have been able to wait a few more months | 
 "words": This is my first new vehicle | I was looking for something with good warranty fit in my budget good gas mileage | I got some of that | I have had it for a short time and its been in the shop more times than i would like to count | I would not recommend this car and will never buy anything from Hyundai again | 
 "words": My husband and I bought our second Hyundai Accent about one month ago | Our first one we purchased in 2001 and it is pushing 95000 miles and still scampering along we never had any major problems with the car | I have been driving the car approx | 62 miles each day for my commute to work and just love it | Even for a smaller engine it still has pep | The interior is actually bigger than our 2001 and I like the outside styling much better | The only downside is the quality of the plastic interior | Hyundai should use better plastics | Our side panel did not fit correctly and that needs to be replaced but no big deal dealership has been great | 27 miles gas mileage 'round town | highway 33 | 
 "words": This car is ok if you just want a puddle jumper to get back and forth | I bought this car as a left over 2008 b c the price was right but I should have spent more for a better car | The sheet metal body panels ding very easy | This car rattles with every bump maybe due to the sport suspension | The interior plastic scratches easy very easy | Plus I am only getting around 20-21 mpg in the city | 25-27 mpg on the highway | I do better with my old awd Subaru | The car is good for parking around town in tight spaces and can hold a large amount of groceries with the rear seats folded down | 
 "words": I bought this car in September '08 as a replacement for my previous car a '96 Saturn SL2 | I test drove this car and the Yaris before ultimately purchasing the Accent | The Yaris felt narrow while the Accent felt much wider and has a warranty that can't be beat for a couple thousand dollars less | There have been mixed reviews about gas mileage but I am averaging 30mpg with the manual | This car turns on a dime and I have gotten TONS of compliments about how cute the car is | Tango Red looks much better in real life than on the website | The shifter isn't as smooth as the Yaris but all in all I am very satisfied with my purchase | 
 "words": The Accent drives quite smoothly and in that way it fits my driving style quite well | The most pressing complaint I have is its long shift time which makes the GLS 4-speed automatic feel kind of like a manual | The suspension is loose too which makes curves a little wobbly | However it returns good real world MPG figures and is very economical in other categories | Accent offers plenty of trunk room passenger area and leg room rear head rests height adjustable seat belts and many other features I probably still haven't discovered | For what it is Accent is an excellent car | 
 "words": A lot of car for what you pay | The gas mileage is fantastic I get about 32 to 34 mpg | The interior is great but you can tell that the plastic on the inside doors would scratch easily your not careful | I have the SE model and it comes with the stiffer suspension which really improves handling | Acceleration is very decent too because I have a manual | Don't get an automatic the manual is cheaper lighter and a lot more fun to drive | Beware the trunk is tiny Also buy the SE coupe as its the only Accent model with ABS which has already helped me out this winter | IMO ABS is pretty important | XM radio is great even has a input jack for an MP3 player | CD player is also MP3 enabled | 
 "words": I looked around for a car for almost 6months then I found my Accent | The price the payments and the insurance all fit perfect | I'm 20 live on my own and work full time and go to school | So money is tight but I never stop moving | I needed something cheaper dependable and good on gas | My little car is perfect | I can park anywhere and I love my XM | Oh and I had it out in the country for the first time the other day and it handle the gravel roads and bumps great | 
 "words": The overall configuration of the two door hatchback is nice because it gives you large doors to get in and out of and large items can go in the back without the limitation of a small trunk opening | My Hyundai only got 21 mpg to start and that declined to 15 mpg | For a 1 | 6 liter engine that is unreal | The wipers did not work from day one and the dealer took over a month to get the part | It ran cold always the transmission way slow to react and locked up at times | The engine would tach over 4000 on the interstate in any kind of a grade and gave the feeling of going backwards | The service department was impossible to deal with at my dealer making the warranty useless | 
 "words": I am on my 2nd Accent and the first was a 2005 Accent | I have driven this new car over 2 weeks now and I love it | Compared to my other car it rides better drives better and there is less road noise | I have 6 ft plus sons who has head room to spare | The color is perfect and with the spoiler in the back quite cute |

 "words": City driving has been between 26-29 mpg consistently with an automatic | Highway comes in at 33 | Visibility handling and power are excellent for a car of this class | The a c and heat provides a very comfortable cabin | 
 "words": I bought this car as a long distance commuter car | It's a GS model with the bottom options package so I could A C | 5 speed manual | I work a week on and a week off so I drive once a week 135 miles there and a 135 miles back | I have also driven this car all over Southern Louisiana and Eastern Texas for work as well and once to Chicago | The comfort level of this car for long trips is good | The seats do hold on to you well in tight turns | The shifter steering wheel and pedals are all positioned well | I have gotten as low as 27 | 5 mpg and as high as 35 | 5 mpg | My average 31 | 5 mpg | I researched the Yaris and Aveo as well and this is hands down the best deal | 
 "words": After a lot of research I found that the Accent was by far the best vehicle for the money | I got the SE with all the options including sunroof body kit Auto for 14700 including tax and fees | Just like the one you see in the marketing posters | If it wasn't for my wife I would have preferred a 5M and saved some more | I wanted a economy car with great looks and some options and the accent covered it | I avg 30mpg with DC traffic | Low 27 high 35 | 
 "words": After 3000 miles I'm still thrilled with this car | I've averaged 34 mpg so far with about 70 of my driving highway miles | I test drove the Yaris Corolla and Mazda 3 first but found this a far better value | I also considered the Fit and Versa | I was most interested in a quiet ride mpgs price and warranty | The Accent hatchback is great for these reasons | I was surprised the others had so much road noise at a higher price | That said over about 60mph the Accent engine gets more noticeable | The only things I miss from my old Rav4 are cruise control and a rear windshield wiper in snowy conditions | Traction with snow tires has been great |

 "words": I have owned my Hyundai Accent SE for less than two months it is under 3000 miles and has already been at the dealer twice for rattles from either the rear suspension of the hatch | The dealer can't seems to fix it took it to a body shop with no avail | Driving 80 miles a day the noise is VERY annoying | I was told if they can't correct this time I would have to Deal With It | Not acceptable | 
 "words": Honestly I was set on buying either a Nissan Versa or Sentra but now I see that my Hyundai Accent was a great choice and is a great starter car for me because of the great gas mileage it gets and it is compact with all the necessary options | I especially love the radio because of the bigger screen and the XM | Most of all I feel safe driving it even though it is smaller than most cars | It has great control and sustains the bumps and potholes on the streets | Overall I would recommend any student driver to purchase this car because it is affordable and has mostly everything you need |

 "words": So today I bought my 2008 Hyundai Accent in the bright green | I think it's called candy apple | Anyway I have put all of 5 miles on it so I will be writing a follow up review but thus far I absolutely love it | It has an aux jack which is a plus 90 days free XM and great fuel economy | I would opt for the SE if possible because of the extra features but they didn't have one so I settled and do not regret it | It is a little slow to accelerate which any one of these reviews will tell you but the fuel economy makes up for it | As far as ride goes it's great | It's my first Hyundai and I am super happy | Just do your research because that's what smart car buying is | I hope this was helpful | 
 "words": This is my second Hyundai and I am very pleased with the Accent as much as I was with the Sonata | The car has lots of power with the a c on and it is a fun car to drive | 
 "words": I have always driven either a large sedan or suv | I thought that a small car would be uncomfortableslow and poor quality | Boy | Was I wrong | The Accent that we purchased is quick made of great quality and is as smooth as any large sedan or suv that I have ever owned | Let me clarify quick | I took this Accent on a short road trip to California from Las Vegas | I was able to cruise at around ninety and I was passing much large and more expensive cars along the way and in L | A | The best is now I put in 25 of gas every eighth day instead of 50 every three days | I did look at other small cars such as the Toyota Yaris and the Chevy Aveo | I found the Accent to have a better value and warranty |
