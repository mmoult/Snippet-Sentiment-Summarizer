 "words": Driving 130 miles daily to and from work I average 18 | 5 miles gallon at the sweet spot of 63 miles hour | Freeway I have gotten up to 21 max | Power is great ride is a bit bumpy with the TRD package | Ford's interior is much better designed as far as layout | The leather seats should come with the ventilated option like the highlander | No real problems yet emergency brake needle adjusted | Tires on the TRD hydroplane a lot will not use the BF Goodrich next time | I should have opted for the navigation system and forgotten about the JBL under the back seat | Interior storage room lacks but the 6 | 5 foot bed is just the right size for most parking lots | All in all would I buy another YES | 
 "words": I had the old tundra with the 281HP 2006 and what a difference the 5 | 7L is compared | This puppy has what it takes while I don't tow a lot I know she has what it takes | Once you start her up she is ready to go | My truck acts like a pit bull on a leash with a poodle walking in front of it | You can feel the power this piece of machine has as you speed up and slow down through the tranny | My truck is barely over a year and a half old and I have about 44k miles on it | Beside oil changes 60 bucks a pop and the power steering fluid change nothing has gone wrong | I'm close to buying tires for my 18 inch rims for 4 tires firestone wants about 900 and sam's club about 600 for michelins | 
 "words": Biggest truck driven so far | Sometime it felt like driving a school bus because it's so big inside and outside | Love the Big V8 and Big brake | Truck is very quiet and firm on the roads | The only thing I don't about this truck is that it uses too much gas | Getting around 14-18MPG on mix driving | Got to trade it in for Tacoma or 2nd home equity loan soon because getting expensive to fill up the gas tank | I don't understand how millions of people can afford to drive any Big V8 everyday because I can't | 
 "words": Wonderful truck | Have had all the others and no comparison | Rides well handles well and smaller V8 handles my needs | Same story on gas mileage as everyone else but the same or near all the others | Paint seems thin and scratches way to easy | Truck needs door mouldings and doors ding easily | Upgraded wheels are dull and lifeless | 
 "words": Small V8 performance and with it's five passenger hard top coupe styling cozy intimate and very comfortable four adult pass interior coupled with decent gas mileage | makes it the perfect choice for a single empty nester like myself | The 21 | 5 MPG Hwy is the frosting on the cake pretty amazing for a vehicle this size | The 60-40 split flip up rear seat with under seat storage holds all my camping gear or whatever securely locked | Plus I can tow up to 5000lbs if I want | Great Truck | Looks great I get lots of compliments | Mine is White with Graphite Bucket seats with Console | My traveling office |

 "words": Awesome truck over all | The dashboard is quite noisy in the colder months due to plastic | The quality of the body material is terrible | You can literally leave a dent in the truck if you smack it w your hand | this is not truck quality | I worry that the truck will look several years older than it actually is in just 3 years due to the poor quality body panels and paint | 
 "words": I traded in a 1st generation Tundra for a 2nd gen | Tundra | I have hauled my family car up and down the Rocky and Cascade Mountains with both trucks | As much as I liked the 4 | 7L it knew the weight was there | But as I expected the 5 | 7L didn't flinch or break a sweat going up the steep grades | Some owners find the engine braking annoying | However I find that when you are hauling and going down a steep grade it allows for the driver to have control of the vehicle whatever you're hauling | Overall this truck has exceeded my expectations | 
 "words": I've had my 5 | 7L for about a year and will exceed 25K miles this year | This is a well-made vehicle | It replaced my 05 F250 diesel | Now this is no F250 but I do pull 6000 pounds with it and it's pretty good | Without the trailer it's just plain fun to drive | Of course mashing the accelerator cost you lots of money because the fuel mileage is pretty poor | I'm mostly highway and I average around 16 mpg | The price I got a year ago was incredible | This is a whole lot of truck for the money | Only real complaint I have on this truck is the paint | It's very thin and scratches very easily | This is a common complaint of the Toyota Truck Forums |

 "words": The new Tundra in my humble opinion is the best fullsized truck on the market | Fantastic power turning radius styling and capabilities | Toyota has finally hit the mark w this all new Tundra | It drives like a car | Precise handling and whisper quiet | 
 "words": I honestly can say that this truck out accelerates barely my 400 hp modded dodge hemi similarly equipped featurewise no doubt due to its 4 | 51 rear gear ratio which seems to get overlooked in comparison tests as the main reason it's so quick | As far as handling the steering felt looser than my ram which has 80000 miles and the brakes were softer than I expected | Overall it's a nice truck but it's not my style inside or out and if I ever tow 10000 pounds on a regular basis I'll be driving a diesel | 
 "words": Traded in my 2003 Reg | cab Tundra for the Dbl cab 5 | 7L what an upgrade | Excellent truck to drive for work or pleasure | I did search around and compared other trucks but still kept comiing back to Toyota's standards of quality and reliability | I'm 6'5 and can comfortably sit in the rear seats | The power is exceptional |

 "words": My last truck was a 1500 gmc and while it was a decent pick-up this truck is heads and shoulders above it | The 5 | 7 is powerful and the 6 speed transmission is real smooth | I have a 24' travel trailer that weighs 5800 lbs loaded and it pulls it with no effort at all | Dislikes I don't like the way it revs when you first start it cold | It's almost 2000 rpms and holds for about 10 to 15 seconds | The gas gauge reads 1 2 full and only takes 8 gallons of fuel and the oil gauge holds slightly below the 1 2 mark | I've never had a car or truck that didn't hold a least 30 lbs oil pressure when driving but I'm being told that this is normal | I'm keeping an eye on it and hopefully it won't go lower | 
 "words": Downsizing from a 2500 diesel to this was easy | The cab room was awesome and the truck will move even with a load | No need for a 2500 with this truck and handles like a car | Completely impressed with the quality and the safety extra's Toyota puts in their products stock |

 "words": This is my first truck | Every vehicle I have ever owned was under powered and I made an agreement with myself that I would not make this mistake in a truck | I took it a little to far because this truck has more power than I will ever need | But it is so much fun to smoke an F150 off the line when they feel the need to egg me on | 
 "words": Test drove every truck in its class and have to say that this is the full package | The best truck out there for the money | It blows every one of the other trucks out of the water | It comes with so many standard and safety features that with the other trucks if you added the same options they would cost more | I'm very happy with the purchase and I just recommend that everyone test drive the Tundra and you will see why it is TRUCK of the YEAR |

 "words": This is a great truck in every way except the rough ride | I love the accessories and the 5 | 7 liter engine | The six speed transmission is very versatile | The 4X4 works great in heavy snow and on ice | The ride however is bone jarring and very uncomfortable on anything except a smooth asphalt hiway | It feels like it needs about 2000 lbs | of load in the back to calm the jerky ride | I strongly recommend that if you have neck or back problems look elsewhere | Fuel economy is not great but is what I expected about 15 mpg average for all driving conditions | Brakes are excellent leather seats also |
