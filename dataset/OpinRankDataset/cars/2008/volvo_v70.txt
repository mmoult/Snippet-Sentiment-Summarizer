REVIEWS
 "words": This is not a typical station wagon | The handling is not like that of a sports sedan but it works for what this vehicle is | You will appreciate the comfort and convenience that the V70 provides and although I have yet to see proof I hope that it is safe as well | 
 "words": Swapped for an E320 1 shorter and cavernous in the back which I don't notice while I am having so much fun in these wonderful front seats wheeling a surprisingly sporty but beautiful driver cabin | Drives like a high-end sport sedan | 
 "words": I've put 6500 miles on this car over the past 6 months and have been very pleased | It replaced a Lexus LS430 and an older Volvo V70 | The ride quality is smooth and quiet | While I really enjoyed the super-quiet ride and precise handling of the Lexus I am also enjoying the sportier driving experience of this Volvo | I much prefer this car to the roughness and sway of the SUV's I have owned | Based on the car's computer readout fuel mileage is considerably better than the EPA numbers 30 32 MPG at 60 MPH | Build quality seems good with no significant problems so far | 
 "words": This isn't necessarily a fun car but it is comfortable quiet and practical | I think it makes a lot of sense for a family that needs something big enough for kids and gear but isn't interested in a minivan or SUV | The interior is beautifully designed and assembled | It is one of those cars where almost every design decision appears to have been driven by a lot of thought about ergonomics | Materials are generally high quality | While the base price might be 32K it is difficult to find one without a lot of options and a much higher MSRP | However I was able to get a left- over 2008 at a bit over 25 percent off | I have had this car for only two weeks so ignore my reliability score | 
 "words": A lot of fun to drive | Great handling | Excellent braking | Beautiful interior very comfortable | This is my 7th Volvo and I'm not disappointed | Very classy exterior styling | With freeway driving I'm getting between 27 and 30 | 5 mpg | 
 "words": Picked up the car in Gothenburg Sweden and drove 1800 miles through Europe | Very easy to handle beautiful interior typical great seats and well laid out dash switches gauges etc | Evolutionary update to the design of my S60 | If anyone is thinking of the European delivery program do it well worth it even with the current value of the US dollar vs the Euro and SEK | 
 "words": This car is what you would expect from Volvo | Understated performance design with good handling | This is my second Volvo wagon previous 240 | I love the wagon for the car ride with the hauling of a suv | Pleased with fuel economy | I commute 70 miles round trip daily on interstates and average 26 mpg | 
 "words": I have owned the car for three 3 months now and have been very pleased | I was looking for a vehicle that would be capable of towing a small pop-up camper yet not be as bulky as an SUV a station wagon was a good solution and the car is very comfortable | As I was previously a Honda owner fuel economy has been disappointing but not unexpected | I average 22 to 23 mpg with my city driving and a tad over 25 mpg on the highway not too bad all things considered but I do use high octane fuel | 
 "words": Bought to replace Dodge Dakota Quad Cab after having baby | Compared mostly against Dodge Magnum and BMW Sportswagon | Volvo had nicest interior and was reasonably roomy | Dodge had most room and great performance but wife didn't like the styling | BMW had best cornering and steering feel but was a little small | Car will be used for long cruises and day-to-day driving so it was a perfect fit | Driving dynamics are sloppy but it still has good overall grip and acceleration | The interior is beautiful and really helped sell us on the car | It is a pleasure on any kind of drive has a great stereo is quiet and roomy | I really like to drive it and I typically drive a 350Z | 
 "words": I've had the car for two weeks I am very satisfied with the vehicle it's got lots of pep is very stable in snow and ice is rock solid on dry pavement very tight steering very little torque steer great in tight turns at speed a quiet and enjoyable ride | I'm getting 21 | 5 in mixed driving I burn mid grade fuel | 
 "words": I've only had the car for a month so it's difficult to rate reliability | I purchased the vehicle primarily based on safety and I did a lot of research on safety in determining what to buy | When it comes to safety the V70 is a vehicle in which I feel comfortable transporting my golden retriever and passengers particularly back seat passengers | The vehicle feels as solid as an SUV without the gas mileage and top heaviness | It's a car I hope to have for years to come |
