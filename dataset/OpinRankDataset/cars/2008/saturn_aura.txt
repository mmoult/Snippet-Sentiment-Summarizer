REVIEWS
 "words": I've had my Saturn for about 3 months and so far have loved every minute | My 4yr old and 2yr old fit perfectly in the backseat with their carseats | I am disappointed we couldn't find this car in our price range that had leather because the cloth seats are already showing wear and one drop of water makes it look like a ugly stain | It rides smooth at 75mph and my highway mpg is 31 and my city mpg is 26-27 | 
 "words": Now that I have had the car for a while I can now say I am more than pleased with it | I have discovered that using semi-synthetic oil helps a bit with gas mileage as does putting better tires on the car | Now getting 22 mpg in town and 34 on the highway | Better than with regular oil | The ride quiet and handling are vastly better with Continental 225 50 17 DWS tires than the OEM ones | All in all a lot of bang for the buck | Too bad they are going away | I'll be driving mine into the ground since it works so well for my needs | 
 "words":  I have owned this car since 01 08 and bought it new | i am extremely happy with it in everyway | it rides as smooth as all of the other cars that i looked at in the 40 to 50000 ranges and looks just as nice if not better | I have had hundreds of people looking at it and asking what kind of car it was and who made it because of it's beauty | I am especially impressed with it's smoothness and gas miledge | others may have rated this Saturn low but as for me two thumbs up Saturn | 
 "words": This has been one of the worst cars I've ever owned | Major electronic issues -blows fuses radio speakers quit working randomly none of the onboard computer info works properly alarm goes off without being set Transmission will not downshift normally ex must hold throttle completely to floor on a hill as car will be in 4th gear at 800rpms will shift in neutral while in drive redline then downshift to 2nd gear car takes off backwards while on any slight hill as if it were in neutral Horrible gas mileage 11-14 mpg Dealership is horrible | they always tell me there's nothing wrong its completely normal for these things to happen it's too complicated for them to explain | 
 "words": I bought this car to tow behind my motor home | I'm a full timer and tow it a lot | Great all around gas milage great ride looks real nice | So far my only complaint is the key fob failed to function properly and had to be replaced by dealer | If Saturn continues to around I will buy another and I hope it does 
 "words": XEV6 has the right stuff to make it nice to drive | Amazing ride and performance but gas mileage not much better than a 1998 DeVille | For my tastes and budget it's a CTS at a Chevy price and better looking to boot | Multiadjustable power driver's seat is a must for taller drivers | A C system is pretty much useless on hot days or if the car has been sitting in the sun for a while | Takes quite a while to cool down even at the maximum cooling settings | Saturn dealer says this is normal | I guess I'm just spoiled from driving Cadillacs for 25 years | Now if Cadillac could make their cars as reliable as the XEV6 they'd really have something | 
 "words": plenty of power | Handles well paddle shifting makes car fun to drive
 "words": This is my 4th Saturn car and I loved them all never a problem | I now have the 2008 Aura XR and we just love this car | Very comfortable to drive the stereo system is a delight for a great sound | Leather seats are very comfortable and in our cold climate the heated seats are just great | Gas milage is acceptable and the 6 cylinder engine a dream to drive | 
 "words": I look the style and looks of my Aura | However it rides like a buckboard at around 55 mph | Had it back to the dealer when I frist got it over and over | They were never able to resolve the issue | And the left compartment will not stay closed they also worked on it over and over | I just don't use it | I drive a lot of highway miles 40000 a year so most times I am over the 55 mph's were the bumpy ride is | Dealership has been a disappointment | I was also a little shocked to see how much value the car had lost in one year | 
 "words": This is the best car I have ever owned | I get 34 | 5 mpg | hwy and 27 | 5 in the city | The only negative I would mention is that it makes a rubbing sound when backing up and the dealer told me that is standard | 
 "words": So far so good | I have owned 2005 VUE for the past 2 years and it seem to be cheaply made the Aura so far from I can tell is a well built car and worth the 21K I looked at other cars with the same options that were in the 30K range and not as nice to drive Saturn has a winner with the Aura | The Aura handle nicely and is very comfortable seems to have a lot of power with good gas mileage Very quite car when on the highway doing 80 mph and big bang for the buck | 
 "words": We had a 2008 Saturn Vue and had problems so I took it back before the 30 day return was up and got an Aura | Best move I ever made on a car | The ride is great and if you turn the track control off you can leave smoke with the tires | Many people think its a Honda | And it cost many thousands less than a Camry | 
 "words": I was hesitant to purchase a Saturn at first until a coworker talked me into visiting the dealership | I'm glad I did | I'm very satisfied with my new car | In two months of ownership I've actually had 2 different people stop me after parking my car so they could ask me about the vehicle which is a first for me | Anyway the car is great and I'm very impressed with the performance styling features etc | for the price | It really does seem like it should cost around 10K more | The all around mileage has been decent around 24 | 6 mpg and it has been a joy to drive | Didn | t feel the extra 4K was worth it to go to the XR | 
 "words": So far so good | I have owned Honda Accords for the past 15 years so this was a big departure from tradition | Time will tell if the reliability factor is there | 
 "words": After test driving the alternatives the Aura XR blew me away | I was a confirmed Toyota fan but the new Camrys and Avalons did not measure up | The Aura has been a pleasure to drive and the dealer experience great | Only time will tell if longer term reliability will rival the Toyota and Honda | 
 "words": I did a lot of research before buying my Aura XR | I wanted to replace my boring 2005 Accord with something more fun to drive | The Aura did that and far exceeded my expectations | This car is on the same level as the Acura TL not Accords or Camrys | It's quiet smooth powerful and loaded with just about every option you'd ever need | This is my first Saturn but I anticipate staying with them for a very long time | 
 "words": I traded in my 2004 Honda Accord V6 after I drove the Aura | This car looks and drives better than my Honda It's a good value the build quality is excellent | Looks like it should cost more | 
 "words": This new Saturn did something that I thought would never happen I bought a Saturn | After trading in my 2003 MINI I have not looked back | The Saturn is more pleasant to drive and certainly has more power | The switches and controls are much more intuitative and are easier to reach | The interior looks and feels like a much more expensive car | The body looks more German in a good way than a lot of German cars do | Is it as nice as a loaded 3 series BMW | No it isn | t but at close to 20 thousand dollars less for a comparably equipped car it certainly is a bargain | If you want a sport sedan with a lot of comfort and luxury features at a fair price there is no other choice | 
 "words": I bought my Aura Xe and drove it from York Pa | to Albequerque Nm with out a hitch | Driving 70-80 mph with the cruise control on I got 28 | 7 mpg | This car is what an American car can and should be | This car is so quiet that you can not hear the windshield wipers working | I owned an SC1 for five years and the only money I put into that car was tires and brake pads | I will always be a Saturn owener because thay have earned my respect by producing a quality product | 
 "words": Saturn Aura is a great car | Handles really well and moves well on the highway | Very quiet when going very fast | Interior leather looks great | 
 "words": We purchased this car for my wife in May of 2008 | A life long Honda Toyota owner she pursued test driving those makes | Accords Civics Corollas Nissans she test drove them all often several times | She came away unsatisfied with all of them for one reason or another style driving experience interior quality | Then on the way to test drive yet another Accord YAWN she saw an Aura on the road and that was that | The car's beauty performance engineering and price were absolutely second to none | Perfect car | People offer positive comments about the car often | 
 "words": I'm about 8000 miles in now | It has great performance | I get compliments on the looks of the car one lady thought it was a Lincoln MKS | The interior still baffles me | For the most part it's quiet and comfortable but the plastics are a bit cheap | The traction control switch is under the armrest the heated seat buttons are down low on the side of the seat and the side mirror switches are too far away | These all need to be re-positioned so they are easier to get to | And who still puts an emergency brake pedal on the floor | I had a bad rattle which ended up being a bad weld on the sunroof bracket | Dealer fixed it under warranty | 
 "words": From the moment I test drove this car till now I have loved every single moment | The acceleration is peppy for a 4 cylinder | The suspension is great and the car feels really solid | I'm glad I spent the extra money for this car over the Astra | 
 "words": My wife and I agree this car will get us each our first ticket | It is very zippy | Love the exterior chrome finishes and LED lights | Very comfortable and safe feeling | Enjoy the XM radio and OnStar feaures like turn by turn navigation | We also own an 08 Vue and have been extremely happy with it | 
 "words": First let me say that I love this car | It is the first new car that I have purchased and I am so happpy with it | For the most part | It looks great | I love the styling on the exterior and interior | It is fun to drive responds well and looks way more expensive than it is | I wasn't able to find the color of car with all the features that I wanted so maybe if I did I would give it 100 but as it stands I can really only give it 92 | And here is why | Now depending on what you are used to the interior materials will look cheap or ok | I think the hard plastic looks cheap | And there isn't a gear indicator anywhere | The interior lights are orange which is hard to see when sunlight hits it | 
 "words": After looking at and test driving several new vehicles I decided on the Saturn Aura 4 door XE | I am very very happy with my choice | great ride fuel economy and looks | no problems at all so far | I have put on 5000 trouble free miles | 
 "words": The styling performance and price of this vehicle is outstanding | I have always liked to drive a car that turns heads and this one certainly does | I purchased the chrome hub cabs which makes the car look even nicer and no one can believe they are hub caps and not wheels | This car rides smoothly and handles exceptionally well | 
 "words": Love this car | Get lots of looks | It is just like the commercial | people can't believe that it's a Saturn | It has all of the great GM extras and warranties but not the price | I am very happy with my Saturn | Needs a couple of improvements but it is definitely on it's way and worth the price especially when you fill up your tank | Saturn is no longer the step-child of GM | 
 "words": I have owned this car for a little a month now and have loved every second of it | A lot of car for the buck | Fully loaded for less than any other vehicle in its class that I looked at | 
 "words": I am very pleased with my recently purchased 2008 Saturn Aura | It has a great engine state of the art six speed transmission and is a joy to drive | We use the remote start heated seats and excellent radio to enhance our car driving experience | Although I spent a lot of time at many card dealers the quality of this car lives up to all of our expectations for a new car | 
 "words": Bought this baby black with black gray leather at an incredible price | I am a GMS customer and I got5K rebate and some GM loyalty | But what a car at any price | Quiet and smooth | Love the tap shifting and it can scoot | Parked next to an 60K Audi S6 also black and my Saturn got more attention and alot more walk arounds | But what I really like the most is the window sticker that says Built in Kansas City with 98 USA components | The 3 | 6 V6 is manufactured at the Tonawanda NY engine plant that GM spent 400 million renovating in 2000 with good high paying engineering manufacturing jobs | My first 300 mile trip averaged 30 | 8 mpg at about 65mph | 
 "words": The 2008 Aura XE V-6 is fun to drive and so far has been more than expected | We leased the XE with heated leather seats boy they work great | We've been asked twice so far how much we like the vehicle and remarks were very sharp exterior and very sleek | 
 "words": After spending 8 years in Volkswagens I decided to trade my 2005 Passat for the Aura | Overall I'm impressed with the Aura | Saturn sure has come a long way | Good power although a little slow to react when you punch it | Little things I notice like some cheap plastics and poorly fitting panels in the Aura | Especially the door panels and door sills which get scuffed very easily | Shouldn't have that at this price point | Seating is not as comfy as the Passat | I'm a taller guy and trying to get a comfortable driving position has been a challenge | Curious to see what long road trips will be like | If I could have the VW seats in the Aura it would be perfect | 
 "words": I have had my Saturn for almost a year now and I love it | I get very good gas mileage in the city and on the highway | I have gotten many compliments from coworkers and from people on the street about the new look of Saturn | The experience I have had as an owner has been nothing less than superb | I have scheduled appointments for regular maintenance with various dealerships and everyone has been friendly | The only issue I have had thus far is a remote that worked at its own convenience | At the dealership the service representative was friendly and swapped my remote while my oil was being changed | I would truly say that this car is a very good buy | 
 "words": This car is more comfortable than my Caddy and more fun to drive and gets 10 mpg more without premium fuel | Not as much room but we are retired and don't need the room | Also it can be towed behind the RV with four wheels down | 
 "words": We absolutely love this car | Our previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer so it's been quite a change | Once all the comparisons were made in this class the Aura impressed us the most | We live in a hilly region so our gas mileage is only about 34 mpg hwy but still twice as high as our old Explorer | We just finished a 10 hour drive on our world famous Cabot Trail and this car stuck to the curves like glue | From a dead stop the 4 cylinder is a bit sluggish not for the lead footed drivers but has more than enough power to pass anything on the highway | At over 6 feet tall it is true that getting into this car takes some getting used to but once inside the fit and finish is the best bar none | 
 "words": Test drove just about all mid size sedans and once I drove the Aura my mind was made up | Great style profile and roomy interior | To top it all off a V6 getting over 30mpg | Saturn making big mistake not offering 3 | 5l in 2009 Aura XE | The 3 | 5l has plenty of power and I have no complaints with the 4 speed automatic transmission | I still can not get over the MPG a pushrod power plant getting that kind of mileage | Handling is second to none put all of these factors together and you have one fun sports sedan | You owe it to yourself to at least test drive and you will want one | Then compare price with other mid size sports sedan you will be sold |

 "words": After driving higher-end foreign vehicles for the past 12 years I decided to give an American-made car a try | Before I decided on the Saturn Aura I already tested a Saab 9-3 Mercedes C Audi A4 and Lexus IS250 | The Aura was roomier quieter more comfortable and almost as nimble as these much higher priced cars | It's fresh exterior has piqued the interest of many fellow motorists who have stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash | To a person folks were very impressed and even more so when I told them the cost of my XR which is equipped with every available option Saturn offers | My other vehicle is a pricey foreign make yet I get as much a kick from the Aura as I do from it | 
 "words": When I started looking at these my husband insisted we get a loaded 3 | 6 XR version | When I came home with the loaded 3 | 5 he did not even blink an eye | It has a smooth ride and is so darn quiet | Road noise is minimal the first time we were on an extended highway drive my husband noted that he could fall asleep it was so quiet | thank goodness I was driving | Acceleration is fabulous although with today's gas prices I tend to conserve as much as I can now | I would recommend this car to anyone and it was fabulous in the snow this winter | I have not had a better car | 
 "words": I went from a 02 Acura RL to a new 08 Aura XR which actually has more features and options than the RL or TL for a lot less money | I like the stance and handling of the XR on its 18 wheels | The performance is quick and responsive and I enjoy the paddle shift on the steering wheel | It's a bit tight to enter and exit but maybe that's just for me at 6'5 tall | The insulated glass makes for a very quiet ride | 
 "words": Overall I am very impressed with this vehicle | This is my first experience with Saturn and so far it has been great | Getting 30 or 31 MPG just everyday driving | The OnStar and XM are great | Major selling point for me was the traction and stability control | We previously owned an 03 Hyundai Sonata that performed terribly in the snow | This V6 is very impressive | The inside cabin is very quiet no wind noise that I can tell a little road noise but still a very quiet car | It handles exptremely well and I am very happy with it | 
 "words": Got this car early in the market and still get compliments and heads double looking | I often don't know what to say in response to the compliments since I wasn't the one to design it | The combination of power fuel economy styling is perfect | Plenty of roomI'm 6'2 | The dashboard info and interior accent lighting one would expect on a 10 15000 higher priced car | I love this car so much that this will be the first time I repeat-buy on a vehicle and I'm a former Honda owner | Move out the way I'm coming to get a 2009 Aura | 
 "words": I bought my fully loaded Aura XR for 21K | The Cadillac engine is smooth and very responsive | The stiff suspension works well for me | The neighborhood teenage kids have already complemented me for having one bad car | And these kids won't drive anything but an Audi A4 or a BMW 3 Series | I am truly impressed with my Aura XR | I come from a Lexus ES300 |

 "words": I purchased this vehicle this month | Far superior to any foreign label the ride handling and performance is superior to anything in its class | An excellent road car that exceeds its EPA fuel economy should alarm all competitors the smooth ride reminds me of the Cadillac but has the performace of a Corvette with European stying | Forget what you have researched and go Saturn Aura | You really won't be disappointed | By the way this is 5th Saturn I've owned and the best | 
 "words": I had a Honda Accord before and I struggled with purchasing a Saturn | I had purchased two other Saturns before for the wife and hated them both but this one has been a pleasant surprise | Smooth quite ride with what I think is preety good gas mileage for a V6 Avg 25 doing city and highway 50 50 | Had one small coolant link since in the first 6 months which was just an occasional drip | Other then that perfect | Wife always had a hard time with Nav systems but the OnStar has been the perfect solution | I drive it about 80 of the time and the wife uses it when she nees directions | She's got an 07 Honda and just admitted that she likes this better | Time will tell if it's as reliable as a Honda |

 "words": The Saturn Aura has very good pickup and power for a relatively small sedan | All the comments about it being the poor man's Lexus are true | Several friends told me that they thought it was a Lexus | I had a Saturn wagon about 10 years ago and loved it had a very good experience with the car | My take is that Saturn has upgraded their product line with a sporty dependable line of cars that are popular and fun to drive | The only thing that bugs me about the car is that there appears to be a weird blind spot at the right front of the windshield due to the design of the front windshield of the car | But maybe this could be offset by adjusting the seat | Overall I love this car | 
 "words": The Saturn Aura is by far the best sedan I have owned | Compare it to the Camry the Camry feels cheap and whatever | The Accord feels flimsy | Nothing sturdy to those cars | The Aura however feels like a presence on the road | You feel like you have something substantial and safe | What a feeling | 
 "words": Dollar for dollar the Saturn Aura is an outstanding car | The lines of the exterior really look like a more expensive car | We drove the XR and found that there was too much torque and HP for our needs | Also drove the Malibu | Chevy has more interesting interiors but the people at Saturn seem a bit more consumer friendly | The inline 4 has good power and the sound and vibration damping are really well done | 
 "words": I have been in the market for a new sedan for 6 months | I have been very picky about what to buy because I tend to drive cars for several years | I drove the new versions of Mercedes C- Class Accord Camry Passat Saab 9- 3 as well as the TL and a Fusion | I couldn't decide on what I liked best | Then on the way home one day I saw a used TL sitting at a Saturn lot | I pulled in- didn't like it then saw some promotions on the new Aura | I loved the way the car looked on the outside but I am also no real fan of Saturn- in the past they have had some of the ugliest cars on the road | Once I drove it I knew immediately I would buy it that day | This is hands down the best car I have ever bought
 "words": While researching my next car purchase I discovered almost by accident the Saturn Aura | I was checking out the Sky Redline as a potential weekend fun car and parked nearby was an Aura XR | The lines of the car impressed me and I liked it's stance on 18 rims and rubber | I decided on a test drive and was again impressed by it's handling the interior styling and the available options | The XR had everything and even more than my 2001 Acura RL including steering wheel paddle shift adjustable pedals and a separate rear seat audio system with wireless headphones | I love it so far now it just needs to match my Acura's reliability | 
 "words": Thank you Saturn for building a car that that finally shows that America is back | As a owner of Japanese cars for the past three years I thought that was the best you can get for a 4 cylinder | The Aura proved me wrong this car is a quality built vehicle with attention to detail | From the chrome trim rocker panels to the solid closing trunk lid ambient lighting trim details XM radio smooth shifting comfortable and supportive seats this car is impressive | The exterior color midnight blue with tan interior and wood trim is awesome for a car in the price category | The paint job is excellent to go the ride and handling is like the car is on rails way to go | Plus this car turns heads |
