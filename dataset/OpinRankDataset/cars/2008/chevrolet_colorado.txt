REVIEWS
 "words": Bought my Colorado in jan 2009 | Everyone says gm quality is as good as anyones | So figured id give them a chance | Fit and finish very poor | Orange Peel in paint | Motor knocks on startup | Constant brake problems | Lots of rattles | Terrible seats | Traded it in today for a Honda | Glad to see it go | I will never buy a gm car or truck again | 
 "words": I have had a lot of trouble with my truck | Engine noise when starting bad brakes and air noise in the cab | None of these have been repaired nor I don't suppose they will be as the dealers say | The engine noise is metal tolerance | I've looked all over the window sticker and it doesn't say anything about an engine knock that you have to live with | The last dealer I took it to fixed it for me | It doesn't knock now because the engine is full of oil additive | The rear lug nuts are worn out because the dealer blowing brake dust out to repair a brake petal situation | The doors are adjusted so tight they pop when you open them | Now thats service | Product is probably good | Service lousy | 
 "words": Hello bought mine used in Jan | 09 love how is looks but there has been a few problems since then found out in the inline 5 motor it overheats or runs hot when you are towing happened a few times to me already | Motor runs loud tire pressure sensors always need to be reset | Gas mileage is not as good as I was lead to belief for a 5 cyl it should be a lot better | I love the interior room very comfortable on long trips | Bed lights are always going out but I still Love my Colorado | One suggestion invests in a spray on bed liner the stuff that it comes with stinks | Hope this helps
 "words": Love the truck 4wd works great on the beach would buy again | 
 "words": Overall I like the truck | Had some initial problems with a bad Onstar module that was draining the battery | Was fixed under warranty | Gas mileage could be better but have been averaging 20 | 5 mpg combined lately | Much much better than the F150 this replaced | Decent styling very good ride | Fit and finish of exterior could be better | Four wheel drive with locking differential was a big plus during our last New England winter | 
 "words": Have had truck for 4 months | I love the thing | All reviews by experts are poor but owner reviews tend to be very positive | I am glad I got it | Left over 08 listed for 28600 I paid 21000 with all discounts | On-Star is kind of cool | I just use the cell phone part which works very well | 15 per minute is very high | Truck is great in snow with good ground clearance | 5 yr 100000 mile drive train warranty is great | GM quality has come a long way | I hope they can stay in business | 
 "words": I was disappointed with the gas mileage and the 4WD until on a trip into the desert the pavement had run out | It had been raining for two days and the road was a mass of mud and water | I put it into 4WD low and powered through no problems | We went about a mile until we reached a road and although hairy it was fun and we made it without a problem | This truck is a billy goat and I would not hesitate to take it 4 wheeling any time | 
 "words": I keep my trucks a long time | Last two were 11 years and 9 years | I plan on driving the Colorado for at least 12 years or more | We love this truck | I'd ordered it and had exactly the options on it I wanted | I am a little disappointed in gas mileage | Tows my 14 ft fishing boat great | My last truck was a K1500 and I was concerned the small 5 ft bed would be too small | But it's been adequate | Handles great in the snow | 
 "words": I finally switched over to try a Chevy | I've been driving a new Mazda B4000 Ranger and it just wasn't cutting it | This new truck drives great feels like a car and is super comfortable | 
 "words": I sold my 2007 Silverado to get into a truck that was more responsive and I found it in my Colorado | The 5 cylinder offers plenty of power and in line motors are known for torque this one does not disappoint | The interior is basic low end truck but you get what you pay for | I have no problems with the performance ride or handling | 
 "words": The truck has a lot of torque and gets pretty decent gas mileage | I put a KN cold air intake and performance catback and it increased the power and fuel economy even more | I am in the military and use my truck to go home on leave | Gets me there without spending to much on gas | I love the style of it looks sporty | The interior is roomy for passengers or cargo | It hauls my fourwheeler almost like it's not there | 
 "words": We bought this with 5000 in incentives from GM | The 2 | 9L engine is too small and even though this truck is a 4cyl the truck has to work too hard and gas mileage is terrible for a truck this size | It isn't much better in mileage than my 2005 double cab V8 Tundra | Acceleration is also terrible | There is plenty of leg room which is nice | A negative to this truck is there no storage console just a cup holder | Also the back windows in the extra cab don't open at all | Overall this was a disappointing truck | We'll be sticking with Toyota vehicles from here on out | 
 "words": Bought truck in August and it's fun to drive and very roomy | Had 4 adults one child in a car seat and a dog in the car and still had a lot of room to spare | Gas mileage was a little less than expected but still not bad | Love it | 
 "words": Just put 2000 miles on it over fourth of July weekend | Very comfortable | Plenty of leg room for a tall person and plenty of back seat room for car seats | Great pickup for what it is | When I need to haul something heavy I use my 3 4ton diesel | 
 "words": I enjoy driving the vehicle notwithdstanding the lack of features cheap emergency brake release which comes off the fact that none of the seats adjust or that my starter is already experiencing turn over problems | I had to take it in to have the squirrel cage on the a c replaced original one squealed when on but the fuel economy is good for a truck and it is very fun to drive | Sporty in one word | Definetly for a younger driver looking to save on insurance and gas but doesn't mind working out the bugs with the dealership | OnStar is great as well | An all around good buy | Delivers power when demanded | I would have enjoyed a more rugged interior and at least an adjustable driver seat | 
 "words": Got my 2008 Colorado last September | Driven 12000 miles | Gas mileage runs 20- 22 in town | Roomy cab and back seat leg room is adequate for its size | Why the Colorado and not the Silverado | I don't pull anything and only haul lighter cargo- plus I like the extra room in my garage | I do haul my scooter and I've carried a bed full of pavers plus three adults with the A C on and the little 4-cyl powered us right down the road | Engine torques up real quick | Passing on the highway winds it up a little more than I like but it gets moving right away | 
 "words": I should have looked a little harder | It's a bit of a gas guzzler | The interior could use a couple of perks | Had some problems with it starting in extremely cold weather | 
 "words": There is nothing not to love about this truck | I have the 5 cylinder3 | 7 litre engine 242 horsepower It has plenty of power awesome gas mileage for a truck | I'm averaging around 20 21 combinedwhich is pretty much the same mileage I got with my 2006 Honda CR-V | Don't get me wrong the CR-V was a great car also I traded it in with 54000 completely trouble free miles on it But I am in construction and I really just needed a truck | So far the Colorado fills my needs perfectly | Don't listen to expert reviews read the consumer reviews and don't listen to people complaining about it not having a V8 | I had a 2003 Dodge Ram1500 with a V8 and that had less horsepower than my 5 cylinder Colorado | 
 "words": I bought a 2 | 9 automatic extented LT cab with door locks and upgraded seats | I debated between buying a Tacoma and the Colorado | I favored the Tacoma but the seat in the Tacoma convinced me to buy the Colorado with an elec seat | The 2 | 9 engine is not underpowered as Consumers Reports and other want to tell you | The 2'9 downshifts less frequently than the 3 | 5 Terrazo and 4 | 2 F150 I drove previously | On a 400 mile trip at 60 mph on state highways through some small towns I averaged 27 mpg | It is solid and fun to drive | it is attracting compliments regarding its appearance | It is free-wheeling and coasts a lot around town | That saves on gas | The bed-liner came standard with the pickup | 
 "words": It is large and comfortable enough for my wife three kids and I and I am 6'4 280lbs | My Suzuki DR 400 fits in the bed fine with the tailgate down | It has a smooth ride and handles the Texas Panhandle roads well | We have not owned it long enough to get a real test on mileage but I like what I have seen so far | 
 "words": I purchased a 2008 Colorado 2wd regular cab 4 cyl | 5 speed about two months ago | It is Victory Red with fog lights aluminum wheels and monochromatic front and rear bumpers | So far I am very pleased with this truck | The 4 cyl 5 speed combo is fun to drive and has plenty of power even with the a c on | I am getting 26-27 mpg on the highway and about 21 in the city | Also the 4 cyl | is fairly quiet and idles smoothly compared to other 4 cyl | engines I have owned or have ridden in | After nearly 2000 miles the only changes I would make are a little more lumbar support in the seats with reclining seatbacks on the models with the LS trim | As far as ride it's much quieter than my '04 Silverado
 "words": I bought this truck new in 11 07 and traded in my Toyota 2004 Tacoma | This is my first American truck and I am pleased | I have over 16000 miles and it rides great | It holds the road and drives like a car | I had no trouble pulling my 6000lb skid loader out of the mud and towing large chippers | 
 "words": I bought my Colorado in April looking for fuel economy the salesman were very good | But this truck is full of probiems | Just to start the fuel economy it gives only 19 miles per gallon on the expway | This traveling 200 miles north with the wind going the same direction | The brakes do not work fine after the truck being parked for more than 4 hours | It does not have any power at all | I feel this is not I reliable for family truck | The worst part for me is the poor shop service the place I bought my truck has | The personnel checked the truck in less than 5 minutes and told me that the computer did not registered anything wrong and in regard to the brakes the manager said it is brakes dust | 
 "words": I just bought my Colorado and I love it | I have only had it a few months but so far it has served its purpose | I went from an S-10 to the Colorado so it was a huge performance in power comfort and looks | I also think that a drop in bedliner would be great if it came standard | Also the tires they should have better from the factory | I love it | Really glad I purchased it | 
 "words": Picked up this 4 WD crew cab pick-up 3 17 08 | We've put it through its paces ever since | Added running boards a Leer cap | Needed the crew cab as my elderly Dad lives with us | We're a very active country family hauling landscaping materials building materials stuff for the country church we belong to | We just drove it 1600 mi from NYS to Sanibel Island FL | This truck's a great blend of economy utility passenger hauling and comfort | We got 20 mpg on the highway | All spring before the trip we hauled green waste to the town transfer station lumber to build raised vegetable garden beds and loads of rotted horse manure to add to those beds | Very pleased with our choice | 
 "words": I bought this truck brand new | I could not take the back pain anymore | There was absolutely no lumbar in the seat | Unfortunately it took some time to figure this out | I had to push the brake pedal to the floor at times to get it to stop | In the beginning it seemed to have a lot of power for a 4 cylinder | That didn't last long | I started to hear a noise that sounded like metal grinding on metal | That would be the next buyer's problem | 
 "words": This is my first small truck and I am very pleased with it | Rides great has a peppy engine that accelerates quickly | My friends Nissan small truck is not as good as this one | Forget what the editors say this is a mighty fine truck | Bed liner should be included in the future | I have 6000 miles on it and had no problems | Gas mileage is better than indicated by 2-3 mpg | 
 "words": I bought my 2008 truck new Dec 27 2007 it only have 2400 miles on it now and it has spent more time in the shop than on the road | If it setup for a few days it will not start and the dealer feels that the problem is resovled but I do not | I am afraid to use this vehicle for out of town trips because I will never know if it will leave me stranded in another state | This is truly a let down since I have been a Chevy man for thirty five years | I feel that a 2008 vehicle should be more reliable than its predecessors | 
 "words": After a 5K rebate took mine home for 23655 before fees and taxes | Mine came with the 2LT trim w Z71 off road pkg | So far no mechanical problems but wish it was available with a 5 or 6 spd | manual tranny | Am not really sure either why the editors panned it so much | Friend of mine bought a Nissan Frontier and if we're comparing interior fit and finish alone I'd say they are the same | 
 "words": I got the Chevy Colorado because I was tired of driving small cars | I am glad I did I enjoy the fact that I am higher off the ground great visibility | Interior is top notch compared to some of the other trucks I looked at very modern | Has the looks of a bigger Silverado without the pain at the pump | Also the automatic is smooth and after driving nothing but manuals for the last few years it's nice to not be jerked around | Only complaints I have are the keyless entry doesn't work aall the time the first time and the engine fan is incredibly loud when it's engaged | 
 "words": I opted for the Colorado because of the MPG and for the tow rating | Tows 3500 lbs like a dream | Could not be happier except that the seat upgrade would have been a wise choice | 
 "words": I traded my 2006 Tacoma for the Colorado Crew cab 5cyl 2wd | To be honest this was my first American vehicle in quite a few years | I was very surprised and pleased with the quality of the truck and the power of the engine | It's a fun truck to drive and has all the creature comforts that I wanted |

 "words": I just bought this pickup but I must say I love it | The only thing I am not happy with is the tires it came with | They are the General Ameri- Track Tires | I would prefer to have gotten A T tires with a 4x4
