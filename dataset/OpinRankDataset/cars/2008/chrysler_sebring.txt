 "words": This was by far the worst mistake I have ever made when purchasing a car | Owned Toyota Pontiac Lexus and Audi | In the first 20 days of driving my Chrysler Sebring LX Convertible the latch on the trunk stops operating | This means that my trunk lid will not close and is unsafely moving about while I drive | Next problem came at a stop light when the car stalled | Yes I was completely stopped at a light and it completely shut off | Luckily my boyfriend was driving and he of course knew what to do | I probably would have panicked | Third it seems that this problem is a continual problem that CHRYSLER who should be bankrupt from making crappy cars is in denial to recall to fix |

 "words": I bought my car brand new on Jan 2008 | The problems began not even one month later when it started stalling on me | 18 months later and many trips to the dealershipalong with recalls the problem still isn't fixed | Research online about this car and recalls and if you are one of the unlucky ones that have this car beware- it can stall at any moment causing an accident out of no where | Thankfully mine has only done it while I was either stopped at a light or parked | Also press brake hard- if it starts to freak out-it will jump forward and possibly rear end someone |
