REVIEWS
 "words": I have a 2008 Saturn Outlook and recently had some major leaking problems like having to hold a cup to catch a lot of water | I turned the corner and my car sounded like a bucket of water sloshing from side to side | That same evening water started leaking through all the seams in the front of my car ie the airbags on the side columns the 3 buttons used for remote openers my visor and the emergency brake area etc | I also had warning lights and alarms going off because there was water in my electrical system | I had the car towed to the Saturn dealership and they claimed it was a problem with the drain flaps | I don't have room for more | Check out Edmund's Forums for my full post | 
 "words": I've had the car for none months now | The mileage is getting better as the car wears in | We started off getting around 17 MPG but we're now averaging around 20 | We have the FWD so that makes a difference | I still think this is a great vehicle and I'd recommend it | 
 "words": This is my first ever American car | I have been accustom to high end European cars as I enjoyed their speed and performance | I decided to add the Saturn to my list and I have to admit the ride is smooth quiet and very comfortable | It has all the bells and wistles I need and more space than I can use | There is a delay in acceleration which is tolerable for now | The fuel consumption is good compared to my RR which I am giving up | After a month of driving the Outlook I now find my 5 series and 996 a little too rough to drive | I feel a road trip coming up this summer | 
 "words":  We've had our Outlook XR for almost 9 months now and have never had a problem with it | It is very spacious and comfortable inside | The exterior design is bold and aggressive | Especially with the Carbon Flash finish and 19 wheels | I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with a large or small family like ours | Even small families need extra room at times | I can't wait to take it on vacation to Florida | Don't pay too much attention to the negative comments and problems that owners have mentioned on this site | Sure some are warrented but there are many many more owners that have not had problems and love their Saturn Outlook | Bottom line is this is an awesome Crossover SUV | 
 "words": At first we loved this car then the problems started | I've had it in twice for doors leaking from sunroof drain tubes going to take it again soon | Seats are ruined from water damage | Have had the strut mounts replaced windshield wiper blades recalled can't seem to get the popping noises fixed underneath | We are very upset also the car won't even make it up our driveway because of the gravels | It stinks for a front wheel drive | wish we never traded | I feel like we have been cheated | This car is a lemon | 
 "words": Traded in a 2006 SL2 that had severe transmission problems | Got the Outlook have 4K miles on it now | Transmission problems on the new vehicle | Hard shifting and the vehicle jerks every time it shifts | Have been in and out of the dealership 4 times in the past 3 months | They finally agreed to replace the transmission | Very poor mileage | Too much wind noise
 "words": We were looking for a lot of vehicle at a reasonable price and we found it with the Outlook | The vehicle is not getting the great mileage we desired around 19 but the interior space more than makes up for it | We fit five adults and two child seats in the car and everybody had enough room | It handles well in rain but high winds will surprise the new SUV driver | 
 "words": We did a lot of research before buying this car | We have always been a Toyota family | We saw the Outlook and decided it was a match for us | We have had air conditioning issues since the second day we had the car | The air when it is hot outside will blow hot air | It kicks on and off doing that | Had it to the dealer 3 times for fix | They had to replace the entire control console | Then we had the car flooded 3 times because the sunroof is leaking | Terrible design allowing so much water to come into the car leaking from the sunroof | The transmission also seems to lag when shifting gears | We have had the car in for repairs a total of 8 times in 6 months | Toyota we will be back soon | 
 "words": We bought our Outlook in August 2008 traded in a BMW 330CiC | We bought it for it's HUGE interior and cargo space as well as it's seating for 8 | No other vehicle can compare within it's class | It drives great get's decent fuel mileage for it's size and is very comfortable | We had our first big snow here in DC a week ago 6-10 inches and my wife was hesitant about driving the Outlook in the snow | We have owned other SUVs in the past and snow was not their strong suit | However this thing was like a snow plow | No slipping sliding or any problems | She loved the fact that she didn't have to do anything because it is AWD | Great winter vehicle | 
 "words": Poor quality returns to GM | My 40k car is in and out of the shop every 90 days with recalls electrical issues and power steering and other problems | They have covered everything but not my time | Service says the first 9 months they had build issues | I wanted to buy domestic to support the cause and what I got was a UAW Union American Waste of money | I feel bad GM is going under but bad products deserve to fail | Go buy an american built mercedes and avoid the hassle | 
 "words": I love this SUV | I test drove MDX Highlander Pilot | This beast outperforms all of them in all fronts | I am very particular about every thing | This things gets good score on every thing | Interior is clean easy functional | Door paneling is excellent | Seat design and comfort is top notch | Better than MDX | Body fit and finish is great | Ride quality is great | Perfect balance of handling vs ride quality | Noise must be around 72 decibel at 70 miles | Curious if it gets even better with top quality tires | Back of the seat liners need better upholstery | Cup holders should have slots for mug handles head rest position should be adjustable like BMW | 
 "words": We buy a new truck or car every year since 1996 | We purchased the v6 ho engine and we have every option plus we had dual DVD units dealer installed with a little known headrest available option | Grandchildren can sit in the rear buckets and watch the same movie on each unit or different movies with wireless head phones | We immediately left southern Oregon to Boise then Utah Wyoming Colorado and so on all the way to Louisiana | We never reset the trip meter the entire trip just filled it up | When we arrived the dash unit read 23 | 5mpg I was thrilled | We are temporarily in Louisiana on a project and for 6 months the car gets 12 | 6 in town bad | Leather seats are 10 | Had 07 Explorer loaded can't match | 
 "words": I have been told by the GM that there is a ghost in my car he even went to bat for me with Saturn and they will do nothing the control panel has constantly got a warning air bags tire pressure ice on the road none of which are true | The transmission bogs and surges uncontrollably stereo dvs navigation work randomly wanted to get out of the mini-van phase BAD IDEA to do this with a Saturn | Onstar has told me to take my car in for service immediately my air bag could or could not go off anytime | My families safety is far more important Toyota I'll be back | And to top it off no light in the glove box | DON'T WALK RUN FROM THIS NIGHTMARE LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING | 
 "words": vehicle rides good but needs more power | I have brought it to the dealership 3 times with under 7000 miles for a transmission problemand they keep telling me all the codes are good | It feels like the trans is slipping and it over revs during shifts on the highway 
 "words": This is without a doubt the most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned | I took a trip drove 18 hours straight and got out of the vehicle with no back pain | The whole trip was relaxing | The Outlook handles great on snowy slushy roads | I would recommend this vehicle to anyone | 
 "words": The Outlook is my very first automobile purchase and I absolutely love it | The ride is very smooth and if you're not paying attention you could easily hit 80-85 mph | So cruise control definitely comes in handy | I spend a lot of time on the road so it had to be comfortable | I get 20 MPG which isn't bad but it could be better | This vehicle is really fun to drive and the White Diamond is beautiful | I would definitley recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": I bought my wife an Outlook XR for the new family hauler and we love it | She saw the Acadia when it came out and fell in love but the Saturn is the best bang for the buck in the Lambda platform | We were able to buy a well- epuipped Outlook for less than base Acadia money | We found the Enclavethe Traverse would also to be much harder to see out of because of the ramped up rear side window and small back glass | The Outlook has the 2nd best-looking interior after only the Enclave | It is averaging a true 18 | 9 mpg which is better than I expected | It is very smooth has a quiet ride with very decent power for a 4600 car | I never thought I'd buy a Saturn but after year 1 I'm glad we did
 "words": GM really did its customer research when they built the Saturn Outlook | We have now had our Saturn for 1 1 2 years and we remain extremely satisfied | In addition to wonderful build quality the interior design is outstanding | I am 6' 1 and my 13 year old son is well on his way there | With the second row captains chairs he and I can comfortably and easily get into the third row seat far easier than any other vehicle we tried | A great surpise After changing my flat tire which was quite easy I found that Saturn had put a large plastic bag in a storage area so that the dirty damaged tire could be stored in the back so as not to make any mess | Wow | Very nice touch | 
 "words": Did a lot of research when buying my first new car | Looking for a reliable car to go on road trips | loved my two used Suburbans I had previously Poor gas mileage | Get 12 in town averaging 15 mph 19 on the highway 53 mph | Took it in twice- Mechanic says I'm getting 16 22 | It broke down out of state | Had to have computer replaced at 2000 miles | The passenger seat bottom had to be put back on | Can't get used to the small window in the rear hatch | Can't see distance to back up park | Frustrating | Now I am anxious about going far from home for fear it will break down again | Defeated the whole purpose of a new car | 
 "words": Just purchased my outlook in Nov 08 | Fun to drive | Getting in and out is easy | Seat belt needs a little work
 "words": I realized in the 1st tank of gas that I wasn't getting the MPG that Saturn told me I would get | The vehicle is rated at 16 MPG city but we struggle to get 12 | It would be different if the vehicle was driven hard but it's driven very slow in a fairly small town that you don't drive over 35 MPH | I've had the vehicle back to 2 Saturn dealerships 4 times and they can't seem to figure out why it gets the poor mileage | The last Saturn dealer told me they drove it and got over 16 MPG | I offered to ride with them to verify their claim and they refused | My wife loves the vehicle but if I knew it was going to get 12 MPG I would have bought another vehicle with a V-8 engine | 
 "words": I was looking at a variety of vehicles as I come from an SUV history | This meets all my expectations and was cheaper than its cousin the Buick Enclave | I am totally satisfied with my choice
 "words": This car is without a doubt to me the best car for a family currently on the market for those who are non-minivan lovers | The driver and passenger feel like they are in a luxury car while the kids feel like they are in a roomy minivan-like environment with a DVD player 110V outlet for the x-box and easy in and out due to the lower than most SUV's ground clearance | Our 3 year old can easily get in and out himself | Overall it's a fantastic car that is fun to drive yet has all the features that a busy family is looking for | 
 "words": So far the vehicle has been a great town and city cruiser out with friends | Love the center console and rear console for second and third row passengers | Love ride quality
 "words": I've owned my Outlook for 14 months and have had several problems | Transmission leak in 9th month of ownership | two repairs on leaking sunroof and now an oil leak | Love the car otherwise | MPG is around 18 City | I'm selling it a car this expensive should not have transmission problems before a year is up | 
 "words": I love my Outlook XE | It's just fantastic | The only downfall is the gas mileage | I truly believe I get 24 miles to the gallon on the highway but the city mileage is questionable | I think if the gas mileage improves in upcoming models this vehicle will be the crossover of choice | At least it is for me | 
 "words": My wife has been wanting a new Outlook since the first time she saw it | After driving it so did I | Great riding vehicle | So much space for a midsize SUV | This car can definitely compare with any other SUV in it's price range | If you're looking for a vehicle that will keep your kids content on a long trip trust me please put the Outlook on your list | The hardest decision will be deciding which color | 
 "words": Overall owning the Outlook hasn't been too much trouble except for the sunroof leak which has been present ever since we've had it | It's been back at the dealership a total of 3 times soon to be 4 and it's still leaking | Other than this little problem no issues | 
 "words": We love our Saturn Outlook | It's comfortable and we've had no problems at all with it | We're in the market for another new car and we're realizing how great of a job GM did with this vehicle | The nav system is top notch and we also really like the stereo system and overall interior design | The car drives well has good pick up and can carry 7 adults without any problems | 
 "words": I really like my Saturn Outlook | I replaced a Toyota 4runner that had multiple problems over the two year lease I had | The Outlook kills the Toyota in every way | Build quality and quietness is way better than the Toyota | I would buy another saturn in a mnute | I will never buy another Toyota
 "words": I love our new Outlook | It is perfect for our family | I love the seats and the option to have 8 in the car at once | We have 3 kids who actully don't mind being in the middle seat together | It is very roomy | 
 "words": Recently purchased the Saturn Outlook XR AWD | Special ordered the Ocean Mist with Gray leather interior | Drives smoothly and very comfortable and spacious for family of five | Looked at Enclave and Acadia as well and with same options Saturn is a better deal dollar for dollar | We have the same options as the Acadia SLT-2 for 1500 less | 
 "words": We needed a car that could carry 6 kids plus stuff and tow a boat and we didn't want a monster SUV | The Outlook is exactly what we needed | It carries all of us and our gear comfortably | Mileage isn't great but it's not a compact and we knew it going in | 
 "words": We looked high and low to replace our Honda Pilot this time last year | I saw the Outlook in a magazine and went to see it for myself | My wife wanted another Pilot | I wanted a larger Tahoe SUV | Glad we didn't go there now | After the first year we can honestly say it is the best automobile we have ever owned | But why would you want to pay more for the GMC Buick sibling when they are made side by side in the same plant but are thousands more because of the name plate | I have suggested this SUV to many friends and all have six have purchased and all have great things to say | 
 "words": Shopped nearly all makes of crossovers and minivans to replace our aging Windstar and couldn't be more pleased with our Outlook | Have not had any problems it is a pleasure to drive solid feeling and very smooth on the freeway | Selected the XE with most options because we liked the interior appearance better than the XR | 
 "words": I also fell in love with the Enclave but the price was more than we wanted to pay | We had to order our Saturn AWD with a 8 week delay but it was worth it | I drive on some awful dirt roads down in Mexico and the Outlook handles very well | I do notice some reduced power going uphill but does not affect the overall enjoyment of the ride | I'm getting 16 mph around town which is what they advertise | I love having all the interior room and my 6' son has room to spread out in the 2nd row bench seat | And our three dogs enjoy all the room in the spacious cargo area | We're very happy with our purchase | 
 "words": Second time in 2 months we brought our Outlook in for a water leak | the first time the rear sunroof leaked and absolutely soaked the carpets mats and center console in the front of the car | The second time water was dripping from the driver's side near the side airbag hn to my wife's lap | We were told don't park on an incline | The back hatch door has no clearance so it is wearing a groove into the rear bumper | We were told nothing we can do | The remote start didn't work for months | Plastic holding the seat belt was razor sharp Mechanic's words and is cutting a groove into hard plastic interior surfaces | No more Saturns for us | 
 "words": Shopped really hard for crossovers to replace our aging minivan but had trouble finding anything with as much room until my wife fell in love with the Buick Enclave | Fortunately our checkbook steered us to the Outlook | Much more affordable even with leather seats and DVD | Enclave had softer ride but lots of pricy extras that we really didn't need anyway | Acadia was in-between priced but maybe even more truck-like | Our FWD Outlook has good MPG 22HWY and 20 mixed without much break-in yet | Still has good performance and power quiet ride transmission shifts well not too picky here | 
 "words": I have only had my Outlook for a few months but love it already | We are a family of four and needed something roomy but wanted to avoid a mini-van at all cost we found the outlook and it is great there is plenty of room for the kids and the back seating is not to bad either | There is a lot of space and overall great for a family of four | or five | The only problem I have or don't like is getting to the third row seating it's a bit hard and I wish i would have opted for the captains chairs in the second row but over all I love it | 
 "words": This is easily the best car I've owned | This vehicle handles great is very comfortable and feels like a luxury car | We went with the Cocoa w black leather | Everyday we comments on this car | We can't get over how much room there is | It really does seat 8 comfortably | 
 "words": I had been looking for another vehicle for a while considering both new and used | I pretty much tried every crossover before chosing this one Nissan Murano cheap feeling car the GMC Acadia the Buick Enclave and last I tried the Outlook | I made the right decision | I love to drive it it is comfortable and the options are great | The ride is smooth the view is great from all angles and the storage is almost as much as my full size Yukon Denali I just had | 
 "words": Love my Outlook | It's fun to drive and looks fabulous | I was tired of the minivan so this is perfect | My kids love the double sunroof and DVD | It is the ultimate family vehicle | Saturn service has been great | Owned the Outlook for 1 year and have had no problems | Free oil changes and tire rotation | My only complaint is the mpg | My average is about 18 | however I drive about 80 mph on the freeway 90 of the time | The premium sound thumps | Love it | 
 "words": All my cars have been premium luxury cars Cadillac Corvette etc and until now I would have never looked at a Saturn | Until now | This 2008 Outlook has changed my life in so many ways | I fit better than any other car or SUV on the market 9Escalade Lexus RX GX Ford Edge Explorer Audi porsche Cayenne etc I can go on but no others compare | The Outlook overall is just an amazing tour de force of engineering comfort ergonomics class and quality | The main reason I like this car is because it rides like an enlarged car not a modified pickup truck like most other sport utes out there | A V8 would be nice but not required | 
 "words": We needed an SUV that could tow our boat seat the family and the dog comfortably and not break the bank at the gas pump | The interior room on our Outlook is unbelievable even in the third row of seats | Towing is competent but lack of a V8's power is apparent | A remarkable amount of techno-goodies hint the Saturn is a much better value the way it is equipped than an Arcadia or Enclave | Won't win any prize for looks but not bad either | Gas mileage is a question mark | City driving we're getting about 14 highway better at 22- 24 | Transmission is annoying shifts back and forth on the slightest grade although it seems to be getting better | Pefect family cruisemobile | 
 "words": I wanted to write and warn anyone who is considering the Saturn Outlook that this vehicle has been a nightmare for me and my family | We have had it for 5 months and it has been in the shop for repairs 6 times in the last 6 weeks | We have had water leaking engine light on engine running when the keys are out of the ignition radio coming on when we are not in the vehicle and finally the complete lack to start | Saturn has been very difficult to deal with and we are in the process of a lemon law claim | Our vehicle has been repaired several times with after market materials and it's always returned to us in filthy condition | I strongly suggest not purchasing a Saturn Outlook | 
 "words": I have driven a minivan and two Suburbans over the last 14 years | We were able to downsize as our oldest is going to college | This vehicle is a wonderful change of pace | I love the size drive and features | I fill it with kids several times a week and it is very comfortable as well as easy to lay down seats and haul anything from girl scout cookies to landscaping material | We shopped both the Acadia nad the Enclave | Would have bought another Chevy but it has not come out yet | Huge selection at the Saturn dealership with the features we wanted | 
 "words": The look and space are amazing | We also own a Saturn Wagon SW2 and Saturn was always top of our list for a new car | We considered a Vue but fell in love with the Outlook | It's drives like a dream | quite smooth powerful | The interior is wonderful | We chose second row captain's chairs and all the seating is very comfortable | I am nearly 6' tall and one of my son's is 6' 2 and we drove as passengers in the third row with no issues | Plenty of leg room and head room | the Captain's chairs also allow you to really stretch out if needed | Of course the engine handling and operation are good we expected that but the storage is a true revelation | We also love the DVD player | high quality fun | 
 "words": This vehicle was chosen carefully a decision for Outlook versus M-B GL350 CX-9 Highlander Pilot | Outlook wins out in space adult seat count and access power weight ratio size driveability towing and AWD | We also suspected that the fuel economy would be worse than advertised and it is | We live in the southwest with a lot of flat land and mountain grades as well | I've managed 19 mpg at 75 mph on the freeway | In town 14-15 mpg | Hey people when you spend 40 grand on a vehicle you better be able to afford an extra couple hundred bucks a year on gas for driving a 4700 pound CUV | It's not a giant size Yaris | Our 7000 lb diesel crewcab 4wdF350 gets 20 mpg but that's another story | 
 "words": Purchased our new Saturn three weeks ago | We fell in love with the styling and roomy interior | We have decided to use the exchange option that Saturn offers | With less than 1300 miles the car has developed camshaft problems and a noise from the rear end every time we turn a corner | This 275 hp engine is not very strong when driving up hills | Its been in the shop three times in three weeks | If the exchange vehicle is not any better we will probably never purchase another Saturn | 
 "words": We owned a 2002 Windstar van | We wanted something with seating for 7 and bucket seats in the middle row | Looked at the Acadia and found out about the Saturn | We love this car | My wife wanted to stick out the old van but has come to love this car | It has good performance for a V-6 the gas mileage is decent 16 in town 19- 21 on the highway | I think to get better mileage you would have to sacrifice performance and it has a nice blend of both | It has ample legroom for all of us | We love the XM radio and also the OnStar | We love the way the Outlook looks on the outside | My wife particularly enjoys the radio controls on the steering wheel and she loves the heated seats
 "words": The best and most comfortable quiet car I have ever owned | We drive to Fl over 1500 miles and I usually spend about eight hours behind the wheel | With this car I feel as though I could keep on driving all day and night | My only gripe is the gas mileage | I am hoping as I drive it more that it gets better | 
 "words": I love my Outlook | I just took it to Montana from Colorado hauling a trailer | It did OK a little sluggish in the wind gas mileage suffered but very comfortable | I drove the entire 1800 miles there and back | XM radio came in handy | Looks great inside and out | I finally got the car other people look at going down the road | 
 "words": I absolutely love this vehicle | I traded in a 2000 Ford Explorer and I couldn't be happier | I was looking at the Acadia as well but the Saturn was almost identical for a lower sales price so it was a no brainer | It rides quite smoothly and the 2nd row captain's chairs work nicely for my children | I'm getting about the same mileage per gallon on the Outlook as I did the Explorer | The remote start has come in handy on the cold mornings we've had recently | The dual sunroofs are my favorite option on the car | My one small complaint is that I wish the moon roof retracted into the roof completely and that the vents did not automatically come on when it is opened | 
 "words": I love my Saturn Outlook | Never owned a Saturn before and I will own more | It out performs any other car I have had on the snow and ice which I have had a lot of opportunity to test with this crazy winter | I previous owned 2 Ford Explorers a Ford Freestyle and a Ford Expedition | I went back to Ford when my Freestyle Lease was up -they tried to sell me a KIA yuck | I bought the Saturn and I am so happy with it | it is roomier than the Explorer and the Freestyle | Although less comfortable seats than the Freestyle | The anti lock brakes and traction control have made it easy to get around while I watch other cars sliding all over in the crazy icy- snowy weather we have had | 
 "words": Evene before we purchased our 2008 Outlook XR AWD we first saw it at the Maine Mall | Now that we have poruchased we made the right choice this is a great crossover SUV | It meets our needs and we do a number of trips to Massachusetts | We enjoy everyhting about the Outlook
 "words": We bought this car for the advertized fuel economy and to buy American | I alway buy AWD but thought FWD would be fine and thought mild increase in fuel economy would be good | Wrong | This car can't get out of it's own way in the snow | It's so heavy in the rear there is no weight on the front tires | Forget about pulling onto a street after a snowstorm | The MPG is 15 | 5 at best | You can get near the 24 on the highway if you don't exceed 65 MPH | All in all 15 | 5 is not 16-24 that they advertize | I am a sad consumer when 2 of the three reasons I bought it were a fraud | 
 "words": I love everything about my XR | It is sweet to look at it is even sweeter to drive | The sunroof and moonroof combination are a dream | Navigation system rocks | The auto-start is great with the heated seats being fired up when it is cold and the a c being blasted when it is hot | Remote opening of the back hatch is very handy pop it then pick up what you are loading and load it with ease | Captain seats in the 2nd row is a great idea I tote a lot of stuff and people | I have put over 10000 miles on it since October and I love road trips in it | I have tried out every channel on my XM and I love the fact that the radio downloads local radio stations so I don't have to search the airways | 
 "words": This is the best car I have ever owned and its a Saturn | I just came out of a loaded 2006 Range Rover HSE and I would have never even thought about a Saturn Outlook XR AWD but after test driving it I fell in love with everything about it | It is so roomy inside the styling is very up to date and it drives with so little effort | It doesn't look big from the outside the profile is very low but don't let that deceive you inside is spacious with room for 7 | Its a little sluggish off the line but if you downshift you make up for that | My only complaint are the doors they tend to close on their own after opening them tough with kids but you over look it | A must buy | 
 "words": I recently purchased my Outlook in | I thought I was ahead of the game by purchasing an Outlook instead of the Toyota Sienna | My number one reason for purchasing the Outlook was the advertised fuel economy | I thought it was too good to be true and I was right | I have exactly 2596 miles on the vehicle | I use the cruise control religously on the freeway with just myself in the vehicle going at the speed of 65mph and I can never get better than 20mpg | I also had the time to test the outlook driving in the city until I had to get gas with just myself in the vehicle at all times and the best mileage I got was 13 mpg | I am so unhappy | Next time I will rent a car before I purchase | 
 "words": I have to say I was upset that GM gave up on minivans | Their latest batch were pathetically ugly and I was looking forward to them replacing them | Then we were told no more minivans from GM | They were being replaced by the Outlook Acadia and Enclave | Not only that but the price on these goes up 5K over the price of a minivan | Reluctantly I went to check out the Outlook and Acadia and I was plesantly surprised by the quality and design | My wife liked them very much too | Since we have 3 kids under 4 years old we needed the room so I bit the bullet and bought the Outlook XE | I don't regret my decision at all | 
 "words": Test drove GMC Acadia Mazda CX-9 Chrysler Pacifica bought a 2008 Outlook XR FWD | The Acadia didn't ride as nice as the Outlook and had a few rattles to it | One practically melts into the Outlook's leather seats | Nice leg room in 2nd row | The ride is smooth but can be rather stiff over bumps | It is quiet you can hardly tell the engine is running | road noise is minimal | The interior is handsomely designed and the amber lighting over the front seat console is a nice touch | Impressive fit and finish | Engine power is adequate although it is not the quickest out of the gate | Transmission is smooth but is hesitant to downshift | Not bad gas mileage 18 cty 21 hwy | Nice vehicle | Good job GM | 
 "words": We've had the Outlook for less than one month | I love driving it | I traded in a minivan | I had to have brake and windshield wiper fluid added already but I think it is because the levels weren't checked when I bought the SUV | It is fun to zip around in and feels so much sportier than my minivan | No longer a minivan driver forever a soccer mom | 
 "words": Just made a 2500 mile trip and it was a pleasure to drive | I averaged 22MPG for the whole trip and it didn't tire my 68 year old body | This is the best car I have ever owned and should last me for all time | I had thought to get the navigation package but the OnStar is does the job as well | 
 "words": I have had my Outlook for over a week now and can't say enough about it | It drives smooth and is powerful on the road | Can't wait to wake up tomorrow for the drive to work | 
 "words": We love this car it's super roomy luxurious | Handles like a car | We took 4 adults 2 children in carseats with room to spare | 
 "words": I was ready to get out of the minivan but wanted to keep my seating config | 2nd row capt | chairs and fold down split bench in the 3rd row | This is exactly what I wanted | My Outlook has just about everything except the Nav system and the dvd but this is why I opted not to get those | since I have OnStar I figured I would use that if I needed help with directions | Why pay for OnStar if you aren't going to use it | Also I didn't really like having a screen come down in my sight line from the ceiling so I opted for a portable dvd with wireless headphones which turned out to be a good decision as I can bring it on airplanes too | The only dislike is the low city mpg 15 | 6 hwy mpg is fine 23
 "words": Ive had this SUV for a little over 3 weeks and so far it's been exceptional | No concerns here | If your looking into getting a resonably priced full size suv than the Outlook is the way to go | 
 "words": Saturn really got it right this time | This vehicle doesn't just look good- it rides sooo smooth better than the Acadia has a lot of luxury features and has lots of room we have two small children and can actually walk around their carseats | Gas mileage is great for a large SUV- I get about 17 city 20-21 highway | I love the power liftgate auto start and the dual sunroofs are impressive looking | The interior looks very quality and the overall vehicle feels very solid | Definitely Recommend |
