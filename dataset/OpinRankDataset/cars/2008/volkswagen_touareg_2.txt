REVIEWS
 "words": Had my t2 for about a year now | This is my first suv and I am very pleased so far | The car handles very well and the drive is very comfortable | My friends are impressed by the handeling and I love the interior design | I have the tan interior with dark Grey exterior | The car still looks and and drives like it just left the show room after about 12000 miles | Also love the overal size and dimentions of the car | Love the width of the hood | 
 "words": I test drove 10 SUV's Nissan Cadillac Lexus Mercedes Volvo BuickHonda AcuraInfinity and then I went to Vw to take them off my list | I fell in love with the ride the ammenities the style and over all performance and stopped at that point and purchased my Touareg | I have owned it for 6 months and I LOVE my Touareg | 73 of the parta are the same a s the Porsche Cayenne but the Touareg is less I like it's style better | Never been happier with a vehicle | My last SUV was a Mercedes ML 350 and I hated that vehicle it was always in for repairs | I'm so impressed with VW I don't think I'll ever get anything other than a VW in the future | 
 "words": Very fun to drive | This vehicle is rock solid | Love the safety features and excellent ride | Don't waste money on the V8 the V6 runs fantastic | Interior gadgets make trips even more enjoyable | Some bad VW should put on much better tires than the Pirelli Scorpion | Road noise is completely unacceptable when the vehicle approaches the 20K mark | Watch for transmission problems | The first time it was a electrical sensor that prevented the car from upshifting from 1st | It took the dealer a week to figure that one out | The next was a rubber bushing on the drive shaft failed causing the car to vibrate extensively upon acceleration | 
 "words": Overall the vehicle is great | Very well designed from inside to outside | VR6 gives enough power already the handling is fine too | Performance is great in the snow | Feels very safe and comfortable when driving | The fuel economy is ok considering the huge weight | Might consider TDI if buying this year though | 
 "words": This vehicle is the worst automobile I have leased | Numerous problems from squeaky seats dragging noisy windshield wipers bend lighting goes out every 2 to 3 months electronic problems with navigation loud engine noise when accelerating to strange transmission problems when it rains has caused me to write this review | Each time problems are identified to the dealer no problem is found or corrected | Or the problem is sporadic and I can not emulate it for the dealer | Who has the time to visit the dealer every one to two months | 
 "words": I am owner of this car for five months and tell you the truth it is an amazing SUV | Car is strong stylish and Awesome | When you are driving the car off road | this is the car you want | Much more safer than the other suv's | 
 "words": I had owned two passats prior to this | Both were great | I thought I would get the same experience with the Touareg | Not exactly | I have not had any major failures | However many cosmetic parts are not put together and have had to be repaired over the past year | The dealerships treats you the same whether your leasing a bug or treg | Not cool | Summit VW is great for service not for sales | You have to piece together a complete dealership | Either they service the low end and you get a good deal | Or they service the high end | no price movement but excellent service | 
 "words": I'm a huge fan of VW | This is actually my 2nd touareg and my fifth VW | I owned an 04'also | My first had the four corner suspension which I miss terribly | So I would suggest that option for sure | I love the in and exterior | Its super comfortable | I considered the Audi q7 and the touareg is a better buy if your not obsessed with a name | I do have a few negatives | Its got a higher price tag than others in its category | I'm at 3100 miles and the back seat latches are squeaking which is driving me nuts | The power rear liftgate is great but I have come out to the car and the damn thing is wide open so watch the button on your key | Leatherette on a 40k is not acceptable | Leather should be standard | 
 "words": We were looking at the Nissan Murano and Lincoln MKX before picking up our Touareg at a staggering discount in October | Basically we got a brand-new loaded V8 Touareg for the price of a medium-level Murano AWD or MKX AWD | The interior quality is first-rate with high quality materials and fit and finish that is really precise | The sound system produces very clear crisp sound | The Touareg drives very comfortably and smoothly and steers precisely | It's a vast improvement over the 1997 Chevy Tahoe we bought it to replace | The earlier Touaregs had a reputation for mediocre reliability especially with the electrical system so I'm hoping VW fixed the problems with this updated Touareg 2 | 
 "words": An amazing ride | Pick up even on the V6 is fast amazingly smooth | The lines are beautiful yet beefy seriously fat tires without upgrading to 18 or 19 inch wheels | The lux package is a must lights that turn with the wheels side headlamp spots that turn on when turning left or right | The interior is just like Emirate Airways or Virgin Atlantic Upper Class | The double french stitching ambient lighting the texture of the leather dash walnut and brushed metal trim the stereo system lumbar supported seats deep window sills make driving a pleasure again | This is an utterly awesome car you really have to test drive one to fully appreciate it do it at night you'll be truly blown away | 
 "words": Be prepared to replace the tires on this vehicle approximately every 20000 miles due to the weight of the vehicle and possibly to its design | Volkswagen however does not bear any responsibility for the unusual tire camber wear | 
 "words": Amazing on road and off road This is truly a hidden secret from the American public | A true road car in the German tradition plus a beast off road | This midsize suv is the weight of a full size American truck | The 6 cylinder is reasonable power for all duties and will politely utilize 19 | 7 MPG on the highway at plus 65 MPH | Giving in to conservation you can get 21 MPG easily | The off road ride quality is one of the best | Trim and finish are what you expect in a fine German product | This suv is a dressed down Porche C not a dressed up Toyota | It is too much suv for the grocery but the right choice for the professional who has business off road as in RE development engineering etc | 
 "words": I love my touareg | However at the countryside dealership the service has been horrible | I could not believe how rude some of the customer service people have been | I wish I had bought the suv at some other place | I have had problems with the fuel gauge the seat belt cracked piece broke off | So far | However my friend told me once you buy a German or Japanese vehicle you will never go back to anything else | I got the fully loaded v6 edition | Thanks to edmunds I got the touareg at cost | The ride is smooth I have the Sirius radio and is the best option ever | 
 "words": I looked at several other SUVs and this was the best buy without a doubt | I love it it is fun to drive and I am impressed with the fuel economy | 
 "words": I test drove Touareg 2 Volvo XC90 and other SUVs Touareg is really fun to drive | I wanted to buy the V8 model in the beginning however after I tried VR6 I found its performance is amazing even on the high way | It's also very easy to control even at the sharp corner | It consumes gas a lot but remember this is a 5000 lbs solid suv not a 1500 lbs hybrid japanese car | It's a must to test drive suv | 
 "words": I have owned several SUVs Honda CR-V Jeep Liberty Nissan Murano and the Touareg is the best SUV I have owned so far | The 3 | 6L engine works fine even if we wish it had just a little more power and the 6 speed automatic is a charm | The back is roomier than the Jeep Grand Cherooke | When I purchased this vehicle I was also considering the Honda Pilot Jeep GC Porsche Cayenne BMW X3 | I finally opted for the touareg because it's fun to drive the 4WD is phenomenal in snow and the back window is straight so you don't loose 50 of the trunk space with the back window that is at a 45 degreee angle | 
 "words": After looking at Lexus X5 Cayane MDX and the Audi | The Touareg is the smartest choice | VW did the right thing on adding the much needed horse power to the SUV and the interior is nice and functional | VW is great but I would recommed the extended if you will keep for more than 5 years | 
 "words": Have driven my Touareg 2 around 2500 miles mostly highway and I'm very happy with the car | It has plenty of power and unless you're towing a boat you probably don't need the V8 | Styling is great interior is clean and functional and overall fit and finish are flawless | Gas mileage has been 19-20 and 26 gallon gas tank comes in handy | Ride is very much softer than other SUVs I've had Pathfinder Rodeo and certainly much softer than my A4 so if you're expecting a tight German ride you won't get it in a Touareg | Power steering is kind of overpowered like a Ford pick-up but I think they do this for off-road capabilities | If this is going to bug you maybe look at the Cayenne | 
 "words": I traded in my 2000 Passat for this new guy | The V6 engine in the Touareg 2 gives it plenty of punch and reasonable gas mileage especially considering the vehicle's weight | With weight though comes safety | The list of standard features is enormous | I only had to add one or two options for it to be the perfect car | a sunroof is standard | The leather seats are very comfortable and the rest of the cabin is nicely trimmed | The navigation system works great | The Touareg 2 is great for off-roading and is still agile in city driving | The exterior styling is pretty cool with the new chrome shield | It makes the vehicle seem a bit more sophisticated and modern and turns heads | 
 "words": After looking at the ML X5 and XC90 the Touareg proves to be the best value | Performance is equal or better than competitors not to mention the top-notch build quality and great looks | 
 "words": I had been looking around for an SUV since May 2007 | I was looking for reliable SUV preferably a hybrid since you get more miles for your money | I went to check out the Lexus RX 450 Toyota Highlander and the Touareg2 | Since I previously had owned an | 03 Jetta and since I never had any problems with the car I thought of checking out the Volkswagen Touareg2 | As soon I sat in the SUV I knew it was the one for me | It was very comfortable inside and I loved how the outside looked | Compared to the other SUVs in the market this one had more room inside and I felt safe |
