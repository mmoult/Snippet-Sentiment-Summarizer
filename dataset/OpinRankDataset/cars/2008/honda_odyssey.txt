REVIEWS
 "words": The Odyssey bought new in 08 has 27K | I posted previous reviews | Additional comments to previous posts are the brake feel could be improved | Mileage improved to 30 mpg on several trips using 91 octane non ethanol gas speed 60 -65 mph | 28MPG has been seen many times | In the suburbs mileage is 21 23 Keep acceleration RPM at 2000 vs jack rabbit starts | The van has had no repairs except for a minor issue with the glove compartment door becoming misaligned due to a screw | 
 "words": Vehicle is average with utility in mind | This could be an excellent basic transportation were it not for tire and drivetrain vibration road noise and Honda's denial and refusal to fix problems | This is not a luxury vehicle even though it is priced as one | Not refined just good basic transportation | There are better choices | 
 "words": Since we needed more space I traded our Acura RDX and it was well worth it | The RDX was fun but it lacked cargo space and ran only on premium gas which was expensive | I chose the Odyssey because it is rated overall the top mini van in its class | Its able to hold a baby seat infant seat two strollers guitar etc | The seats are very comfortable | Driving feels like you're riding on air | 
 "words": First let me start of by saying that I am a huge car guy | Overall the odyssey is a nice minivan | It is a nice ride for a longer road trip or hauling people around probably the best minivan out there right now not that there is a very large selection available | On the down side it is far from perfect | First of when you get a car that is 40000 you should expect better interior materials especially on the dash | It's all hard plastic kinda like the pre- 2007 GM's | I have owned infinities before in the same price range and the dashes were much more luxurious | Secondly the seats other then the driver side are not exactly comfortable | The backs stick out to much | The outside mirrors stink
 "words": We drove it from Augusta Ga | with 14000 mi | It was smooth and comfortable but so was my 2000 Dodge Minivan with 154375 mi | Too many toys on the Touring model | Fun to drive It's a Minivan how much fun is it driving a Minivan it's not a sports car | 
 "words": I purchased this brand new and at first I did not want a minivan but I've found I like the convenience of it | Now I absolutely can't stand it the passenger side door rattles | At first it sounded like a marble | They took the door apart and wrapped everything it was gone for a few months now it's a new rattle and now the other door has started | It's bad when your 4 year old says mommy my door is rattling again | You can't even turn up the radio to drown it out | It's only a year old and I want to get rid of it | I wish I never got rid of my 4Runner | Dealer says he's never heard of this problem | After reading the reviews it sounds very common | 
 "words": A follow-up review from our first month of ownership | My wife and I bought the van for long trips | Using 91 octane at 60-65 mph we average 27-28 MPG | Mileage in town 21 MPG using a light foot on the accelerator | Combined mileage about 22-23 | Very comfortable on long trips | Navi great seats great maneuverability great for van entry exit seat height great noise control OK front suspension OK mileage better than SUV exterior looks great gauge legibility great headlight projection great dash design dated think JDM interior plastic too cheap | Upgrade the 2010 interior plastic to match the 2009 Pilot | 
 "words": Have had the vehicle for 15 months with little to no problems | I did hit a deer on Thanksgiving Eve which did 2200 damage to car | Had repairs done through the dealership with no problems | My only real complaint with the car is the rattles | The passenger side slider sounds like it will rattle right off the hinges | Both sliders creek when coming to and pulling away from a stop | Very annoying | While the second row power down windows seem like a great feature when the windows are open it sounds like I'm driving with flat tires and the thumping in my ears is annoying | I don't have the second row windows down | I'd much prefer the far back windows to vent open | 
 "words": I was really stuck whether to buy a van | But now I am glad I did | After 10 months it has been a good experience | I was also wondering about the cylinder shutdown feature but never notice it | it's so smooth | Mileage on a half city | half hwy was 21MPG when checked | Haven't really found any thing I don't like | Everyone that has driven or rode in it is impressed | 
 "words": Got a screaming deal on the Odyssey EX- L 2008 for only 26388 | I have to admit that I was not that excited when my wife wanted to get a van but now I am a convert | Roomy functional and surprisingly agile which is the reason why I picked the Odyssey over the Sienna | Nice fit and finish power delivery is smooth across the range no kick down comfortable ride even in the third row | My only beef with it is that the gas mileage stinks in city driving | No other issue so far after over 9000 miles | Improve the gas mileage rating and it's a true winner | Very happy with purchase | 
 "words": Just turned my '05 ody in for the '08 EX-L RES | Overall some nice improvements back up monitor tighter fit finish on dash minor exterior tweaks | The big let-down is that the 2nd row jump seat no longer stows in the floor compartment | BAD BAD move Honda that was incredibly useful | now you have to either leave it in hard to access the third row or leave it at home or in the back compartment | Whose bright idea was that at Honda | Still a great van | 
 "words": I picked up this bad boy for 22595 after holding them to their teaser ad | I simply would not let them bait and switch me | The deal got done and I am very happy | I have only had the van for two weeks but the gas mileage seems rough | 13 miles gallon | Just like a recent review the van does not seem to want to coast | It seems like it wants to brake | It may be part of the VSA system | Anyway the rest of the car is the best car ever | 
 "words": So far we've put 2K miles on the van and are very happy with our purchase | The van interior is fantastic with very nice leather and dvd system | It drives more like a sports car van rather than a floaty minivan | Overall we are very happy except for the fact that it has been getting between 12 and 14 mpg in the city and 17 on the highway | Both my wife and I drive very conservatively and even more so with the gas mileage | Mpg has improved some but we're no way close to the 25 hwy | If it does not improve we will be taking it in for service | Also transmission does not allow van to coast and slows speed at 40 mph and under | 
 "words": We have had the van for close to a month now and it is everything we expected | The navigation system is not the best but the screen that comes with it makes everything else easier to read see | The navigation itself is always giving us the easiest route not the most economical one | The leather interior is so worth it and the speaker system is just fine | We paid 31800 total plus the 6 Indiana sales tax and used an internet quote to get the price down to where we were happy | The gas mileage was the biggest negative but we get about 17 21
 "words": Had great prior experience w Honda Accord so purchased vehicle over Toyota Nissan | Traded in '98 Caravan driven for over 100K miles | Solid ride standard options and Honda reputation drove my decision towards the Odyssey | Cylinder deactivation is a plus | Very disappointed in quality though | This is a grocery getter and not driven hard | After 9K miles there has been 4 trips to dealer for alignment service resulting in premature tire wear 2 trips for steering knock which by the way is a known serv bulletin issue that requires special lubricant on the steering column now a rattle in the sliding door | This is a Honda | I actually had less issues w Caravan | Now test driving a Sienna | 
 "words": Honda contiues to impress me | I have been a Honda fan all of my life | From my first mini-bike as a kid to our most recent Odyssey purchase | I checked out the Toyotas but the Honda can't be beat in styling or ride quality | The 4 wheel independant suspension makes our Odyssey drive like our Accord | The ride extremly quiet vitually no engine or road noise | My wife and I love listening to XM radio while the kids watch DVDs with the wireless headphones | I know some folks are stuck on their SUV image but nothing can beat the value or functionality the Odyssey delivers to perfection | Go Honda | 
 "words": Have had back to dealer multiple times for various problems | The rear power hatch stopped working needed new motor | The transmission clunks into gear had lever linkage adjusted but still doing it | Radio reception is terrible and overall it's a noisy ride at highway speeds | Anyone getting 20 mpg must be coasting downhill with engine off | best so far in 5000 miles is about 17mpg | Would I buy again never | 
 "words": We had a 2006 and recently upgraded to the 2008 and like the first we love this van | Rear entertainment is top notch it handles like a dream and the safety features sell themselves | I'd have another if I could afford it | 
 "words": What is not to love | We have 4 kids and our only options at this point are suburbans or Minivans | We looked at Chrysler TC Toyota and Honda | Honda was a no brainer | It has plenty of horsepower with our whole family and a incredibly smooth ride | For the family who needs a touring vehicle with all the bells and whistles this is the car | The sound system is excellent I have 2 teenagers and it is very important | it is also important to have teenagers to show you how to use the nav system | 
 "words": Have driven the vehicle for 635 miles so far and averaged 24 | 2 highway and 18 | 3 around town | Pretty darn good for such a large vehicle | Very tight vehicle comfortable and handles well in snow | 
 "words": Dont judge it by my 9s to most people this car is a 10 | I just think you can improve on everything | Great van | It runs great is extremely comfortable | The fuel economy is good but not great | I did find the highway mileage impressive | I got 29 mpg average with luggage and 3 adults and 2 babies | City is around 20 mpg still pretty good for its size | Try that in a regular suv | It's a van so performance and fun to drive not what you expect in a van but it's a great ride | Everything else interior exterior quality and reliability is summed up in 1 word Honda | I would purchase the extended warranty though only because lots of bells and whistles that can break | 
 "words": We traded in our 05 EXL RES with 47700 miles on a 08 EXL RN and the difference is amazing | The ride has improved the sound dampening has improved and the fit and finish is better | The floor mats aren't as thick have less thread count and they aren't engraved with Odyssey on them | The back of the 3rd row seats are now carpet instead of leather | I like the telescoping steering wheel a lot better and now it's more ergonomically comfortable to drive | Even my wife can tell a drastic improvement between the two vehicles | We never thought we'd like driving or even owning a mini-van but now we can't live without it | Convenience room better gas milage than SUV's and comfort done well
 "words": Before buying the Honda I extensively test drove every 2007 and 2008 minivan currently available on the market | I've only put about 1000 miles on this van so far but I am extremely impressed with every aspect of this people hauler | The LX came with everything that I wanted and nothing I didn't | We owned an '05 Accord for a few years and I think the Odyssey handles like an oversized Accord with a better view of the road | Around town mpg is right at 20 so far no trips yet | I think this is the best van on the market for the money paid 23500 plus tax and license | I am rating this against recently test driven and previously owned mini vans not all vehicles in general | Hope this helps | 
 "words": Have this for now almost 2 months | No problem so far | Handles well feels very solid and stable | I am driving it like a car | Front chrome grill is little loose at corner | Dealer service agent promised to take it to body shop to get it inspected at my service visit | Seems to be a loose snap | Mileage so far is not great | In city only around 15 | 5 mpg | No long hwy driving so far | Love rearview camera integrated to rear-view mirror | I think it is better than having camera view in dash | You don't have to take your eyes off mirror | 
 "words": This is our third Odyssey | We bought the first one to accomodate our grand kids and liked it as an all around vehicle for passengers cargo | Very comfortable especially on road trips | Averaging around 19 MPG and 23 MPG on the highway | 
 "words": This is our 4th Honda and our 2nd Odyssey and every generation gets better | The van is fun to drive | I love the car-like handling and responsiveness | It has plenty of power for pickup | There is ample of room for 6 adults | Middle 2nd and 3rd row seats are sized for kids only | I have had my new 2008 Odyssey for 2 months now and it has developed one problem | The right sliding door's opened window safety feature which keeps the door from sliding all the way became engaged even when the window is closed which is keeping the door from opening all the way | I'll be taking it to the dealer for repair | The mileage is close to 13 in the city and 20 on the hwy | less than what the window sticker states | 
 "words": We have two you school age children and carpool with two more | Our 2002 E320 wagon has been a great vehicle but we need two 7 passenger cars | After driving the CX9 Acadia and Enclave we looked at an Odyssey | While minivans may not be cool there was simply no comparison in the way the Odyssey functioned compared to the others | Our new Odyssey drives smoothly rides without wallowing gets good MPG has a tight turning circle and more traveling comfort than anything on the market | 
 "words": We bought a 2008 Touring the week before Thanksgiving | Needless to say we never expected to be thrilled with any minivan but this is an amazingly well-designed very sophisticated vehicle | It handles turns and rides like a much smaller car and the interior room technology design and versatility are wonderful | The car is simply loaded and has so many features bluetooth voice recognition navigation backup camera DVD that were not included available on our more- expensive XC90 | Terrific car that us hard to find fault with | 
 "words": Great vehicle | I was impressed with the comfort and upscale feel of this van | Traded in a 2000 Dodge van and the difference was amazing | I did not notice any problem with road noise which is a common complaint against Honda per the magazine reviews | This van has plenty of power comfortable ride and good gas mileage for a van at least | Total package | 
 "words": This is our first Honda and we are loving it | 
 "words": I've put apx 8000 miles on my ODY and not a single complant | It has plenty of power on demand and goes on ECO mode when cruising | DVD player is a must have on those longer trip for the kids | Quality is suprior in it's class | I will buy another ODY No questions ask | Hondas will always be the top contender in it's class just read consumer reports | Never a let down year | 
 "words": I traded in my old 2001 Odyssey EX w NAV for a 2008 Odyssey Touring w o PAX | It's been about month since I purchased it and everybody loves it | The 3000 | discount off of MSRP from the dealer was a big incentive | In terms of quality comfort fun to drive handling and entertainment features it's been great for my wife and our kids | For such a complex vehicle with all of its gadgets there has not been one defect so far | not even a rattle or squeak | The only negative I have seen so far is the mileage is not all that good | My average mpg is around 14 | My old 2001 Odyssey had better average mpg at 18 | 
 "words": Overall it's a great car | Already over 1000 miles on it | Works like a champ and drives great | Be sure to buy it without PAX Runflats | We waited for '08 so we could get normal all season radials | Went through Costco buying program cost 37500 500 over invoice 
 "words": We love our new Odyssey | It has plenty of pickup and delivers close to 20 MPG in regular driving meaning some town some freeway | All freeway we're getting close to 25mpg | I think the people getting 13 or whatever have a lead foot or do a lot of stop and go | So far no defects except for a carpet stain that we found after buying it | The dealer cleaned it up and I think a mechanic probably did it or something | This engine really pushes hard above 3000 revs and it sounds wonderful doing it | The Sienna felt like a barge next to this and the Caravan and Chrysler both seemed too plastic or something | The Honda fit us great | 
 "words": This is our first Honda and we couldn't be more pleased | I am an engineer and appreciate what they have done to produce such a versatile vehicle | My wife loves the van and I have to say that I love it also | No problems so far | The ride is excellent and the handling is great | I have a high performance sports car so the comparison is valid | We went with the 08' because of the newer engine technology options not included on the 07' model | and the new look | Pricing was higher but we feel it was worth it | I just asked my wife if she had any other comments and she responded I love it | 
 "words": I bought this beautiful van in october | I love the 2008 odyssey's solidness and luxury | This van has nothing wrong and at 4000 miles it's never had a single problem | If you are looking for a van the Honda Odyssey should be your only option | 
 "words": Touring model is a lot of fun for media fanatics | There are potentially 6 different sources of entertainment for one car and for a large family that drives a lot it is fantastic | The van is top notch for driving handling and overall fun for civilized driving | 
 "words": I have only driven this van about 3000 miles and I have to say that I am VERY DISSAPOINTED in HONDA PRODUCTS | I have been to the dealership a total of twelve times for an array of problems | The sliding door fell of it's track onto my 7 year old's foot | The DVD player keeps skipping | The lights on the dash will go out with no warning | The brakes are starting to squeek when they are hot | It has terrrible gas miledge 13 city 16 hwy | I had traded a Dodge Durango that got better gas mpg than this thing | And it never broke down or sent me to the dealership for any repairs | I have almost three years left on the lease of this scary creature | I don't think I'm going to make it | 
 "words": Horrible interior and exterior fit finish rattles and hard wind noise | Been in the shop for 3 times replace misaligned top bottom glove box streaks on passenger window and rattles from both front sash trims bought for steep discount and good experience w my current 2002 Odyssey poor fuel economy dangerously soft brakes so-so road handling cheap plastic interior poor front ventilation controls for rear uncomfortable bucket seats too short for my thigh poor paint jobs and etc | Been driving hondas since 1990 1990 civic 2000 accord 2002 oddysey this will be my last | 
 "words": We bought this car in 2008 and it is wonderful | It runs great | The navigation system is great and it has zagat 2007 restaurant ratings | When I drove it it was smooth not bumpy | The gear shifter is at the dashboard unlike the Dodge caravan which is on the steering wheel | The rear-seat entertainment system is good and it features two wireless headphones | It is spacious and the seats are comfortable | Overall I love the Odyssey | 
 "words": The van has great interior fit finish and space flexibilty | Little I would do to improve other than some road noise and very poor MPG | With the variable cylinder management I has hoping to get near the sticker MPG | There seems to be some extra vibration in the steering column when the engine is under load | It was bad enough I actually thought a tire was out of balance easy to get at and change the engine oil | 
 "words": Vehicle purchased new 08 07 | Have had many issues that started as early as 500 miles including dead battery headlamp switch short relays short clunking noises to front undercarriage steering column replacement slider door safety locks freeze preventing sliders to lock while open rattles to right door trim panels | The newest of the problems now at 21K to address with dealer is the headliner seam coming apart and the heater controls not functioning properly | We have NEVER been so unhappy with a vehicle | Traded our 02 Toy Sienna what a mistake | Tried trading this vehicle in dealers are offering low trade | now I wonder if the reliability factor was utilized in the low trade offers | 
 "words": My wife had gone on record as saying she would never drive a minivan | Three kids later she's driving the Odyssey and loves it | The interior is extremely versatile and great room for the kids their friends and all of the accumulated stuff | We've had it on several trips and it's performed great with just over 25 mpg on the highway and around 19-20 around town | The seats are comfortable and it drives more like a car than most vans and handles surprisingly well | It does have a lot of wind noise primarily from the front passengers seat but we just turn the radio up | The breaks are softer than what I'd prefer but not to the point of feeling like we're in danger | My wife's glad we bought it | 
 "words": Bought after totaling 02 Grand Caravan | Has awesome power looks great | Climate control poor only can control temp of rear cabin and not fan speed or mode from the front | Interior is extremely uncomfortable and hard | Dome lights will not go off automatically What | I drive mostly highway 80MPH and get about 18MPG | Caravan was 22MPG | Kinda confusing about maint schedule | There is no set time you have to rely on the comp to tell you when to take it in | Might be 7500 miles or 3000 | Stereo controls are too far away from driver to be comfortable | Hopefully the reliability and longevity will compensate for the shortfalls | Wish I had my Dodge back but playing the cards I'm dealt | 
 "words": This is my first Honda experience | A very reliable well built car | Has many features but always wondered why they couldn't have a back-up sensor versus a camera or a windshield wiper fluid sensor common features on American made vehicles | One of the few minivans still in production | My biggest complaint in the navigation system which was outdated the minute I drove it off the floor | The system also tells you that you have arrived at your destination when you are still at least a block away | You can't get the back up camera without buying the navigation system | I carry a plug in portable system for navigation | 
 "words": Lease was up on my 05 Sienna so I leased an 08 Odyssey due to the better lease rate and better exterior styling | Wow do I miss my Sienna after 4 months | The Honda feels so cheap in every way | Fit and finish is TERRIBLE | Several paint flaws poor fit of exterior trim horrible fit of interior trim and interior surfaces which feel cheap and scratch ridiculously easily | Brakes are downright scary they are so soft | Stereo is the worst I have heard since the AM in my old 66 VW | Rough ride excessive wind noise and an amazing number of rattles round out the package | Hopefully this thing at least turns out to be reliable | 
 "words": I bought this car 6 months ago and the more I see of it the more I think I made the wrong choice | Got stuck in a snow bank and of course there are no hooks under the car to attach a chain to pull it out dig dig dig | Two months ago the side sliding door jumped off the track and had to be repaired two days in the shop | On real cold days before driving the tire pressure alert show low tire pressure | I think Honda needs some better engineering | 
 "words": This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned | Passenger window rattles brakes are poor seat is hard and uncomfortable radio sound quality is dismal | Also the paint is rough to the touch as though it has dirt embedded in it | The steering wheel does not return to the on center position without assistance | I read all the reviews before purchasing and cannot believe that they were mostly positive | Perhaps the higher models are more comfortable | 
 "words": Owned for 5K miles and 8 months | Great van no real issues | Drives and handles like a car | Much nicer to drive than our Dodge Grand Caravan and handles nicer than a Sienna | Road noise is a little more pronounced than in other vans but not bad at all | Had DVD player installed aftermarket for 1 2 the price | Mileage is as advertised 20 around town 24 highway and we're very light on the pedal
 "words": Replaced a 7-year-old Sienna 118K miles | Very happy with the Odyssey so far 6 weeks | Roomy comfortable good ergonomics | Passed up DVD and Navi due to out-of-line pricing given how these have plummeted in price as aftermarket add-ons | 
 "words": I've owned 4 Hondas including this one 3k so far | This is by far my favorite one | I love the styling features road feel comfort and just about everything | It's true that sometimes wind noise is a little loud on the highway but it will not keep you from having a conversation with the other passengers | The Rear Ent | Sys is a definite must-have whether you have children or not | Also I have no idea what it must be like to drive this van without a rear-view camera | This van just feels solid safe and reliable | 
 "words": I've owned my EX-L for about 5 months now and I must say that it is hands down the most comfortable quality smooth vehicle I've ever owned and I've owned at least 12 new vehicles from many manufacturers | I'm averaging 22 | 6 MPG on combined city hwy which isn't bad for the weight | All things considered I bought an excellent van and did so over a Tahoe Expedition and other many mini vans | For the money you can not beat it | 
 "words": I traded my 2000 Odyssey in for a 2008 EX-L and it's great | I test drove 2 of them to watch for things I found in other reviews rattles bad brakes poor shifting pulling to right etc | and the van is great | I drove the car over multiple rough RR crossings and it's as solid and quiet as you can get | The ride is nice solid and everything looks and works exactly as it should | They made some nice improvements including better mileage with more horsepower | Nice work Honda | 
 "words": I recently traded an 06 Pilot for the 08 Odyssey EX-L and I am very happy with my choice | The Pilot is probably one of the best mid-size SUV around but with a growing family I wanted the versatility of a mini-van | I did a lot of research and I found that the Odyssey was the best bet for reliability | I find it to be very comfortable too and the exterior styling beats the Sienna any day of the week | 
 "words": It's a nice van and gets decent mileage | Ride is a bit harsh and road and wind noise prevalent | Needs better insulation and laminate windows like the Buick Enclave and Chrysler Aspen really does make a difference | 
 "words": Compared Enclave Sienna and Odyssey | Enclave was very nice in ride handling and quietness | The Honda had a nicer price with the rebate | It's a good people mover and the navigation system is very nice | The rear entrainment system is very nice but not intuitive really need to read the instruction manual | Using 0-20w Mobil One and averaging 18 | 7 around town with up to 30 mpg on the highway | 
 "words": This is our sixth Honda and third Honda minivan | The 2008 van is impressive in every way but one | The brakes are and I am not stretching the truth here the brakes are the worst brakes I've ever had on any vehicle be it car van truck or bicycle | Took it back to the dealer and was told this was normal | Now if it were a faulty cup holder or other trivial item I would have some tolerance however I am almost afraid to drive this vehicle | It seems the vehicle quality from the Georgia factory is way below par for the Honda that I know My 2002 van was built there too and had a huge list of problems | 
 "words": While my husband recently came home bearing gifts | He left with my Suburban and came home with a Odyssey | I was expecting to notice a huge increase in gas mileage | Only about 18 in the city w air | Not at all pleased with the quality of the interior it barely gets touched by something and scratches horribly | Some pieces are not put together well and they don't match up | The carpet seems to stain really easy and not the best of quality | Seems to change gears at times a bit rough when slowing down quickly | STILL cannot figure out the concept or design with the middle seat belt | TOTALLY useless | The space is so little for a small child but then the seatbelt cuts them across the throat | 
 "words": The Honda Odyssey EX-L is a great buy | I love the DVD CD Changer Wireless Head Phones Heated Leather Seats etc | The only thing i would add to this impressive vehicle in better stopping power | The breaks are adequate at best | 
 "words": Very comfortable for both commuting and hauling the family | Annoyed by all the door safety interlocks but getting used to them | Fit and finish is average | The dash looks like it was slapped together with some of the lines and edges not matching up | The passenger air bag trim is slightly lifted causing a gap between it and the dash | So far I am happy with it | Got 24 | 3 mpg with 95 highway and 21 | 5 mpg with 75 highway AC always on | Looks like the mpg is getting better as the engine breaks in and the computer better controls the VCM | 
 "words": Purchased 3 days ago | Love it however noticed that the driver's side power door will close then beep 3 times then open | It does not do this all the time | Noticed a little wind on the driver's side door with the radio off | With everything I am pleased with the choice with Honda | 
 "words": I have owned the van for about a month and have driven 3K miles on a trip | On the positive side the van is nice to drive looks good and has power | On the negative side the road noise is excessive | When passing a truck you can hardly hear anyone else in the car | The noise from bumps in the road is also very loud | Automatic shifting is rough | The front seats are not very comfortable compared to my 2005 Dodge van | The radio sound is very good but it has the poorest station range of any car I've owned in the last 20 years | The little mirror on the sun glasses holder is useless | It needs a compass | At this point I'm not too thrilled about this purchase | 
 "words": The Odyssey is fantastic | We put 50000 miles on our '06 without any problems | We just traded it in on an '08 Touring | Paid 33186 which is 3700 below invoice | Very happy with this deal | The older one was an EX-L with Nav and DVD | The addition of movable pedals Bluetooth memory seats and power rear liftgate are nice | The fog lights are a nice addition too | This is an excellent vehicle and drives very nicely | the Sienna was just too soft a ride | 
 "words": Because my wife and I are planning to have more kids I traded my 08 Acura RDX for the 08 Odyssey EX-L DVD NAV | It was worth it mainly because of the space comfort and reliability of the Honda engine | 
 "words": I | m an engineer and have been interested in and working on cars for years | I | ve been reading these user reviews and have been amazed at how many people claim low gas mileage | From these reviews it would appear that the Ody is a real gas pig | This however is not the case | My Ody gets about 17-18 mpg S | Cal city driving stop lights every 200- 500 yards | If I can get this and your getting 12 then one or more of the following apply low tire pressure 28 driving habits ultra-short 1-5 mile trips-engine not reach operating temp load number of passengers 6 passengers can't properly calc mpg many don | t do it right bottom line engine variation is negligible | It's the operator
 "words": The interior lacks in luxury but it makes it up with practicality | The stereo is limited LX only one CD but it sounds great | The displays are clear | The sitting height is nice | At my frame of 6'3 it's comfortable | My teenage son thought it handled a lot like a car | 
 "words": traded 2005 sienna xle due to uncomfortable seats | Once Honda offered 5400 went for it | Comfortable seats good power easy controls | I like the dvd controls and insert in front with young kids | got 27 mpg on 500 mile hwy trip at 68 mph with air on | Though around town stop and go 16 | 5 mpg | wish that was better | with 3500 miles noticed wind noise in around pass front window above 65 mph | dealer seen before change out blk plastic trim piece poor design | One blemish in paint from factory but living with it | Scary to hear issues with rattles brakes tranny etc | guess when you sell 125k vans some might have issues | Miss my easy to clean 17 wheels and power lift gate | Though Touring over price
 "words": Overall a great van | I had a 2005 Touring which performed excellently in a roll over not a scratch or bruise on me | That was reason enough to get a second | This time we opted for the EX-L w RN | There are a few things I miss like the memory seats I'm 6'1 my wife 5'2 auto headlights rear sensors and the rear power door some of which should be standard | We compared the new Chrysler van a relative has comparable one and they are by far more feature intensive at the same price but they just didn't have the same level of comfort and the gas mileage isn't as good | Would like to see some of the options at a lesser cost like Bluetooth | 800 a joke |
