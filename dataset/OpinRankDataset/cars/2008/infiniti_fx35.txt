REVIEWS
 "words": Started with an I30 then a 2005 G35x then 2008 G35x now the FX35 | Handles much like the G35's and not really much difference in gas mileage | Love the look the feel and handling | You do get used to the limited rear visibility really you do | It corners and accelerates well | Very comfortable at all speeds | 
 "words": My husband needed a new car so I did my homework and found the FX35 | I loved the shape and appearance of the car it's a strong sharp looking car | We test drove the Nissan Murano but the feel was different than the FX I like the fact that the FX iss a rear wheel drive | Now | I drive the car every day my husband drives the 2nd car | 
 "words": This vehicle has lived up to our expectations | The car continues to be a treat to drive to look at and own | A year later and I still enjoy looking at it and seeing other FXs on the road | It has a very solid ride and is surprisingly responsive | We love every detail and the vehicle in general | We are sold on the Infiniti line | 
 "words": I admire the unique styling on the FX35 it feels like you are driving a sports car with the space of a CUV | This vehicle has been very fun to drive and responsive when power is needed | 
 "words": Recently purchased the FX35 2008 after repeatedly admiring it's aggressive exterior on the road time and again | The car is everything it's penned to be | The equivalent of a G35 with an SUV exterior | Acceleration is responsive and immediate addition of iPod connectivity is nice although not perfect | The luxury features are impressive bluetooth NAV XM satellite radio | Gas mileage is a little weak I'm averaging in the high teens low 20's but that is somewhat expected with the V6 275 HP | The BOSE sound system is fun to listen to and all-in-all I am quite satisfied with the FX | A definite recommend | 
 "words": I've admired this car for years and finally bought one | Now I wish I had bought it years earlier | I have a 2008 with everything except DVD No Kids | When I am on the road and in traffic I feel superior to everything including the Range Rover Sport and BMW X5 | The only other car that I have driven that is even close to fun performance is the BMW X5 4 | 8 even then BMW just has power and cost substantially more | The Infiniti has a sports car feel | I'm still amazed today at how much it feels like a car rather than SUV | When you buy the car don't settle for standard get the full package | 
 "words": I loved this great looking vehicle on the road | Loved it loved it loved it | Until I purchased it | I was very disappointed the very first day | I could feel every tiny bump on the road the steering wheel is very tight therefore it's not very easy to maneuver | I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it | I am 56 and I guess this car is not for shorties | Moms beware | The metal anchors are so deep it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat | Right now I got used to the car love all other features Bluetooth tech pack back-up camera and keyless entry but will be looking for another one soon | 
 "words": I purchase on 9 08 a FX 35 with 42 miles | Three months later the check engine light turns on and has problems starting the mileage at this time was 4800 miles | After 2 weeks at the dealer they told that the camshaft went out | Very dissatisfied with this Infiniti | 
 "words": Over the years I've owned a wide variety of cars including Porsches BMWs a 350Z and a G35 | I must admit that I was concerned that the FX was all show | It looked too sporty to be a true performer | I finally test drove one after a disappointing test drive in the Lexus RX350 | I was immediately impressed | The vehicle has the tight and substantial feel very similar to the Porsche | The front fenders even have the same sloping bulge as viewed from the drivers seat | You truly have the feeling that you are in a serious performer and it doesn't disappoint on the road | If you like driving excitement this one delivers | Again I've owned many performance vehicles and the FX holds its own among them | 
 "words": I am in my second FX35 and really enjoy driving my 2008 model | My first FX 35 was a 2005 model with sport and touring packages | I found this to be the most comfortable fun and stylish car I've ever had and I've owned several luxury and sports cars | I test drove many crossovers and SUVs and felt the most comfortable being a big guy when I climbed back into my 2005 FX 35 | If you want a stylish and fun car to drive check out the FX35 | 
 "words": I bought this car yesterday late afternoon in Houston and drove it home 350 miles immediately there after | We own a BMW 325 I which is my wife's car | I wanted an X5 | I can tell you after this drive that I regret nothing | This is a supreme and finely balanced machine and is not even the top of the line | The sound system is second to none and kept me entertained the whole route | I checked out a MDX Acadia X5 X3 and this puppy is a breed above | The local dealer test drive doesn't tell you the whole story | Wow | 
 "words": Love this FX35 | This replaced the Volvo XC90 as I have safety stored the Carrera as I have the power performance and fun gave the MDX to hubby as I have the comfort style and loaded features all in one car | Handles like a dream very comfy beautiful as all get out | Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price | not bad | Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance | I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on | This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms | 
 "words": I LOVE the FX | It is so much fun to drive and I always get compliments about its appearance | Just the right blend of luxury and sport | 
 "words": I've been thinking about a FX-35 for 5 years | I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider | Love a sporty driver that is practical which defines an FX | Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI | Drove the BMW X6- nice but small heavy overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort size quality sporty drive high end finishes feel of the wheel and those seats | Big side mirrors enhance side visibility with backup camera I can park easily | Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new | If you don't put your foot into it you can do OK with gas consumption
 "words": Have had this vehicle for a month now and love the look of it love the way it drives and love the respect I get on the road | I was most worried about the visibility b c I read the vehicle has a lot of blind spots turns out the mirrors are pretty good about compensating | My one main issue is a personal one I am 5'5 and having a hard time getting the right fit in the vehicle I end up with knees dangerously close to dash in order to reach the pedals and see well through the windshield at the same time | If I move the seat lower the seatbelt is on my neck if I move it farther back I can't reach the gas pedal as well | I think it would be hard to find a good comfort level for shorties | 
 "words": The Infiniti FX35 combines the performance of a high performance sports car and the versatility of an SUV | The 2008 model is sleeker and more high-tech inside | Its performance luxury and technology equals a lot of fun to drive | Highly recommend it | 
 "words": I use my FX35 as a daily driver and my vette on the weekends | The FX has pep performance looks handlingand a nice balance between fun and function | With the high gas prices I've been using regular and don't notice any change in performance | I get 19 mpg in city highway driving | The vehicle is a 'headturner' since I don't see a lot where I live | The 6 cylinder is lively with a smooth 5 speed auto tranny | Styling is unique and built with quality in Japan | It is responsive whether driving aggressively or just as a normal commuter | You don't need a lot of options | I would skip the costly tech package but definitely get the sport package for performance and better personalize the exterior looks | 
 "words": With 8500 miles the FX looks like a keeper even though some of the techy stuff is frustrating | If the cruise is on and you are in a bend it will pick up cars in other lanes and stomp the brakes for you so you really have to watch where you have the cruise on | Bluetooth phone is garbage | Also the black chrome grill is all peeling off and Infiniti says they will change it once as good faith but it's my fault and not a supplier defect | 
 "words": One month in | No complaints | Everything it is built to be | Handling is heavy and stiff yet nimble | Great ride with spot package | Turns on a dime with decent radius | Great 30-60 pickup | As noted it is thirsty but know what you're buying | This isn't a Prius | Interior is sharp and sophisticated | It really only compares to MDX CX7 LR2 and Lexus RX | And there is stand apart | Car should still look great 10 years from now | Well ahead of its time | 
 "words": Owned for 30 days | Great car but front seating needs improvement | I weigh 215 and the seating area is too narrow to ever get comfortable | Everything else is well thought out | quiet ride and so far performed very well with no trips to the dealer | 
 "words": t's the nicest looking SUV out there it's a blast to drive and even the bare bones model comes with everything I need | The interior is wonderfully simple the seats are very comfortable the stereo is loud and the engine really sounds sweet | It does accept regular fuel a lot of it but performance seems to be a bit better using the recommended premium | Acceleration is smooth and reasonably brisk and steering is firm and sporty | I think it's a great value for the money | 
 "words": I'm 33 and I bought this car this summer have 12k driven already loaded with 20 rims every option | I beat on this car and its handling is great just like a sports car my customers and friends love the truck | Back seat very comfortable | I like the heavy weight and agility suspension sound of the exhaust | The roof rack helped with adding a snow board rack | I will lease this same car when my lease is up in 21 months and thinking of giving up my porsche boxster | 
 "words": I leased the FX35 12 28 | After logging 1700 miles I am overall please | Handling is super though could use a little more HP the 270HP is adequate | Recentlt on a snowy slippery day I engaged the snow full time AWD button was very pleased | Did not spin out or slide once | Cabin is comfortable | I am overall very happy with the FX35 
 "words": Was in the market for a new car and I was contemplating between BMW Lexus Audi and Infiniti | I am glad with my decision after driving FX35 just a bit bad in the economy department | Hurts when I'm filling up the tank but the moment I start to drive its all good puts a smile on my face everytime I pull away from others and it's real head turner | Technically it's good in almost every department | 
 "words": The FX35 AWD is an awesome vehicle | The sport suspension is firm but nowhere unbearable | The FX handles like a dream | Steering is precise and provides excellent feedback | I like the 350Z's smaller thick leather steering wheel in the FX | The interior quality has improved drastically from the early 2003-2005 models | Plastic and leather are MUCH softer | I have driven the GX RX X5 XC90 ML GL and Cayenne | The best overall value in the midsize crossover is the FX | 
 "words": The FX35 has everything you could ever want standard | It really does give you the feeling of driving a sports car | There are only 5 FXs in our town each a different color makes you feel very exclusive | I keep getting comments from strangers about how sharp looking it is and this is a 5 year old body style | I'm very happy I decided to drive 90 miles | 
 "words": I needed more room and had to give up the convertible | I was really surprised when I test-drove this car and fell in love with it | The FX35 has a great sporty look | It handles as well as my 2005 BMW 330 CiC with sport pkg | I really enjoy driving it | I have almost all the options sport pkg touring handsfree except DVD player | It's very luxurious on the inside | I haven't given up anything | I can't imagine driving anything else | 
 "words": I'm a confessed carnut and I think this is a great SUV | I've had a Porsche Cayenne S BMW X5 and Lincoln SUVs prior and I think that this one is the most comfortable and certainly the best value for the dollar | I traded in a BMW 745i and as great as that car was there is a lot to love about this car | Sporty fun to drive logical controls very comfortable seats I'm 6'5 and that is always a concern and usable options instead of gadgets just to have gadgets | I would say luxurious as well | I got the sport package and did not notice the ride vs the non sport which I test drove as well | The 20 wheels tires look awesome as well as the other sport trim items that are part of the package | 
 "words": Purchased car new based on analysis among Lexus RX Acura MDX and Toyota Highlander replaced RX | By far a better value great handling especially in windy road conditions tons of standard features options are reasonably priced relative to competition | Driving comfort is second to none | Back up camera is great feature as there is a blind spot in changing lanes looking out the rear sides | Car is quieter than anticipated on screen displays easy to use and make sense | Best of all can fit 3 sets of golf clubs in rear much like the RX so many SUVs today cannot fit golf clubs in the rear compartment without putting the seats down | 
 "words": My wife and I both were amazed at how this SUV handled | Coming from a BMW 3-series coupe and my wife from a Subaru WRX turbo wagon the FX handled turns like it was on rails | My brother has the X5 and it's on par with it | The 3 | 5 engine is adequate but if you want a rocket get the 45 instead | Fit and finish the vehicle is perfect | All the amenities for the price makes it all worth it | The comment by the editors about the interior being an elite Nissan I agree somewhat but it's definitely more appealing than my BMW | Engine is smooth | Suspension and handling are stiff enuff so the Sport Susp | would be unnecessary IMO | You won't be disappointed with this SUV | Pull the trigger | 
 "words": This car has everything I was looking for in a luxury sedan but it is a SUV | I took my time looking for a new car and test drove just about everything on the luxury market | I am about 6'2'' and about 275 pounds | It fits me like a glove | Nothing on the market can compare with the comfort and performance along with the luxury at this price | I purchased the FX35 in early September and have not regretted it one day | It has power performance room luxury and is still decent on the gas | I am getting right at 20 mpg right now and I am not a real gentle driver | I would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": Just picked up an FX and I am completely blown away by it | Traded in a G35 coupe for it and thought I would be losing a whole lot of sportiness in return for utility but that is not the case | The FX has great pickup and handles very well for a 4100 lb car | It has ample room for cargo and believe it or not people have asked me about it and commented how sleek it looks | All this makes me feel that I did the right move | I do miss my G coupe but I feel I will have just as much fun in my FX | Anyone who test drives one will end buying it | That is how good it is | period | 
 "words": My wife and I have always preferred sporty vehicles so up until now have resisted purchasing a SUV | The FX is a great blend of a sports car feel with SUV convenience | Handles great in mts | Some reviews complain about the limited storage space but we find it more than adequate for most applications | Some don't like the exhaust sound which we enjoy but if it bothers you simply turn up the fabulous Bose sound system | We were concerned about possible gas mileage issues but are getting almost 24 mpg on highway and close to 20 mpg in town | Over years we have owned a lot of vehicles but we feel the FX35 is the best vehicle we have ever owned | Goodbye Mercedes |
