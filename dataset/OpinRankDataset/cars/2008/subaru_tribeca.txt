REVIEWS
 "words": We have had this car for about a year and a half | It rides well drives well and has been reliable | Only two complaints | Windshield is very poor quality and breaks with the slightest touch of a pebble | Leather interior is mostly vinyl | After a small tear I found that the only part of the seat that is leather is the small section in the middle of the seat surface | The entire rest of the seats including the bolsters on the seat surface are made of vinyl | No happy about paying for leather and not even getting full leather seating surfaces | Contacted Subaru and they told me that customers like vinyl better | Sounds like a way for Subaru to save money | 
 "words": I usually don't write any reviews but this car is so bad I thought I owed you the reader some advice | Don't buy this car | We bought ours new and the engine eats oil | Dealer said the engine was 'breaking in' | I am now at 20k on the car and it eats 1 | 5 to 2 qts per 1000 miles | Dealer will not help | Also the A C is weak | It is barely ok for the front but on a 5 passenger there is no rear air | My kids hate it always hot | Numb steering brakes fade easily 'manual' shift is poor when upshifting interior clunks and rattles like a 30 year old Ford | There is lots of room for improvement here | Once bitten twice shy | There I warned you | 
 "words": I purchased the car in April of 08 and just hit 27k miles | Small gas tank but mileage not bad for an SUV | The fit of the interior of the car is disappointing loose pieces every where the rear hatch is not designed to strategically close when packing | Also what is the point of the rear blower if I can't control it from the front my kids cant reach it | The look of the car is great but I can't justify the looks versus the quality I expect for the prices | A on the handling and engine although Subaru wants me to change the tranny fluid already | C on interior quality and pointing out as another post did who scans on the radio any more let me change my presets from the steering wheel
 "words": I love everything about this car except two issues that I've had | I have a phantom energy drain that leaves me stranded due to a dead battery | It's random unpredictable and frustrating | I also have had to have the power steering fixed twice they actually needed to put a new pump | regardless at such low mileage I'm surprised | 
 "words": I purchased our Tribeca about 18 months ago and rated it very high | All of that has changed after being stranded 3 times and numerous trips to the dealer who can't or won't resolve the problems | From the beginning there has been a noise in the engine that the dealer and factory reps hear but can't pinpoint so it goes unrepaired also it burns oil but not enough to meet their oil consumption criteria | The steering column locks up and has stranded us three times you have to beat and bang on the column to unlock it the tow driver taught me that and because you can't duplicate the condition they can't repair it | This is our first Subaru and it will be our last | Maybe we got a LEMON | 
 "words": Have 12000 on my Tribeca and have been very happy | I was shopping for an SUV w 4WD AWD good reliability and resale and wanted some luxury appointments leather 6 CD etc for not much over 30k | I chose the Subaru over all others in class as I was able to get most everything I wanted without having to compromise too much | The inside and exterior styling are very unique and the interior is more luxurious and sharp looking that the other cars in class | I've had the car for close to a year and have been very impressed | The AWD system is fantastic in the Iowa winters | After having ridden in all of them I'm happy I chose this over Pilot Highlander 4Runner and Edge |
