REVIEWS
 "words": I am an early adopter of the A5 in early 2008 | After nearly a year of ownership the car is holding up well | I have had no mechanical problems except a burned-out LED light that was replaced and have noticed no rattles in the car after 12000 miles | 
 "words": The Audi A5 is a terrific diver's car | While I would prefer a little more horsepower I love the way the car handles the road | The nav sys needs to be updated but other than that the interior of the vehicle is first rate | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Audi and to say that I am sold on the brand is an understatement | I got the A6 new design when it came out in '05 and loved it | When I saw the A5 and drove it I had to have it | Yes we all have egos | It is OK to acknowledge that | I get more looks and thumbs up in this car than any other I have owned | Great car and beautiful design lines | Only thing I would change is transmission shifting as low acceleration it can be a bit jerky | If you haven't driven one do it | 
 "words": This car is incredible | You cannot look at it not be moved or inspired | Anyone who loves cars immediately gravititate to its inspiring curves and uniqueness a classic | People are just drawn to its stunning design | 
 "words": I have driven the A5 since turning back my S4 since May | Wow what an exciting car this is | I like it better than the S4 and find the power to be almost the same | This car is so well engineered with the weight distribution that it allows the 6 cylinder engine to put like a kitten | Gas mileage is reasonable the running lights are amazing the exterior design is nothing short of superb and the interior is both roomy and driver friendly | I could not be without the backup camera due to neck surgery that will not allow me to turn my neck | The backup camera and assistance in backing up are a life saver as well | I cannot say enough about the A5's drive | I am in love |

 "words": I've had my A5 for almost 4 months now and I still spend a couple moments to admire it before I get in to drive each day | I drove it through the mountains this weekend and had so much fun that I was actually laughing out loud | The handling is great it's totally comfortable and even has enough room in the back for a child seat | I haven't had a single complaint come up | And yes it definitely turns a lot of heads when I'm driving it through town | It actually took me a while to get used to all the stares not that I'm complaining | 
 "words": Having never owned a luxury car this is my first and it did not disappoint my idea of what Audi luxury or any other manufacturer for that matter is all about | It is also my first production coupe ownership as well if you don't count my replica kit roadster | The exterior of the car is in a class all it's own | It takes some sports car queues and blends them into the coupe in a way no other manufacturer has done as of late | The main attraction are the LED's | People stare point stay glued to their rear-view mirrors | The stance from the rear is elegant yet very strong with the 255 wide tires | Interior is simply first class for me | My first leather interior | I love this car | 
 "words": I have owned this car for a couple of months now and all I can say is wow | Though it is down on horsepower compared to the BMW 335 it completely makes up in looks | Two months ago I was at a stop light on a main road | A man was too busy looking at my A5 he drove into the car in front of him | I love the fact I got parked in front of the restaurant by valet | I love that I cannot go a night without a compliment I just love the car | 
 "words": After a few weeks of ownership I have learned that the A5 continues to impress and truly is the beautiful girl whom you can marry and live with | The most amazing epiphany is remarkable fuel efficiency that exceeds EPA estimates of 18 and 27 | I have averaged 26 in city 34 on highway | My weekly trip to Costco also revealed I could transport abundant cargo | 3 large boxes of diapers and baby wipes detergent gallons of juice and more | 
 "words": My first week with A5 reveals it's a well-made car | Exterior design appears even much more beautiful in real life than the pictures | Walter de Silva designer was right when he says A5 is his best design | Interior design is peerless controls perfect and intuitive fit and finish defines fit and finish | Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world | Performance of the V-6 is not as robust as the BMW 335i coupe which was the other car to choose from | However A5 is powerful enough for everything besides drag- racing | 
 "words": Drop dead gorgeous | Da Silva is a genius | This is my first Audi but coincidentally this is the 6th among my whole family | Almost bought the 3 series and then saw the A5 was coming out in the states | The outside is absolutely stunning the inside design is beautiful but ridiculously comfortable | I drive 3 hours a day going to and from work and my commute couldn't be any more fun than it is now | Audi's made me a fan for life | 
 "words": All I can say is if you are thinking about buying it and you have the money to do so do it | it is the nicest car I've owned and I own many cars including BMW's and Mercedes | When you drive down the highway the amount of brakelights you see in the opposite direction as the try to catch a longer glimpse of you is astounding | The car is amazing I love it | 
 "words": The A5 is a truly exceptional car | The finish and fit is perfect | Absolutely no imperfections | The suspension is firm but not harsh with very slight oversteer | It is comfortable fast and gets a lot of attention everywhere I go | The fuel economy is better than the ratings indicate | On a recent 1400 mile trip from Ft | Lauderdale to Gainesville GA and back I averaged 30 | 85 miles per gallon at 80-85 MPH | 
 "words": Forget turning heads this car snaps necks | I have only had the car 2 weeks but there is nothing I am not thrilled with | The value drive style and technology are all superior to any other car I considered | I originally wanted an S5 but just cannot justify the extra 90HP given the fuel economy difference | 
 "words": I am a huge fan of Audis and this one takes the cake | It's got a gorgeous body shape kudos to Walter de'Silva perfect watchmaker-quality interior and is oh-so-fun to drive | It's not a barnburner like the S5 but it's more than adequate for me and will save me a few speeding tickets | I've had so many second glances head turns and people stopping me in parking lots and traffic lights to ask about it | I actually like the fact that they're very rare and will slowly trickle onto the market over the next 1-2 years | For people who like to blend in the crowd and follow the status quo then go buy a boring BMW with crap interior and total crap stereo tech | This A5 is for me | 
 "words": This car is truly the first car I've ever been excited to own and to drive | The exterior design is breathtaking the interior quality is phenomenal | If you're looking to have adults ride in the back seat this isn't the car for you especially if you're tall like I am | MMI much easier to use that BMW's iDrive | iPod integration and Sirius satellite makes the 6CD changer almost an afterthought | Cellphone with Bluetooth integrates in seconds | Manual 6 makes the most out of the engine | I recommend it over the 6A the gimmicky faux manual in it isn't that exciting | Trunk is huge overly large for its class | 
 "words": I've owned everything from Porsche 911 to the Cayenne Turbo from Lexus SC430 to BMW 745i and Mercedes CLS | For the money this new AUDI Rocks | Don't sell the 911 but for everyday zips to work this new A5 not only saves a little in gas but offers on nice comfortable ride | If you like all the bells with true performance then this car is for you and if your luck to own you know what I mean | Thanks Audi | 
 "words": Owning and driving this vehicle is like a breath of fresh air | Despite the fact that it's a lot of fun to drive the positive attention that is received is unbelievable | I was surprised that certain people had no idea that Audi was launching an A5 model until they saw mine on the road |

 "words": With fuel prices the way they are I just couldn't see living with the low mileage of the 8 cyl so I opted for the 6 cyl instead | The dealer had an A5 with an Audi factory installed S5 option cosmetic kit so I have S-Line interior trim upgraded 19 wheels that I like better than the S and claimed mileage up to 32 MPG we'll see I do a lot of highway driving |
