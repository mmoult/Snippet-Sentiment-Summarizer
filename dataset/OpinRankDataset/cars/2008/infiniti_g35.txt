REVIEWS
 "words": This car was purchased from my company for 10000 less than blue book | I had my eye on a sports car but with a luxury look | This was it | I had an Infiniti QX56 but with gas prices I just could not afford to let the tags insurance and now gas eat away at my pocketbook | This car is fun to drive | This car is awesome | My G35 Sport has the automatic manual paddle shifters on the steering wheel which makes this car more fun to drive | The only thing is that since I drive this car fast I wish it had a bigger gas tank | 
 "words": I bought this car used thinking that it would be the best car that I would ever own | It turned out to be ok but was a big let down | Driving it off the lot I felt great I thought it was a reliable car for my wife | In the Arkansas rain my wife hydroplaned and ended up in on coming traffic | The so called traction that this car has is supposed to help it stay on the road but it doesn't and when the slip light comes on you are already all over the road I thought it was just my wife driving bought some 1000 tires to go on there to make sure she was safe and then it happened to me but I was able to keep control of the car | AC runs very loud | 
 "words": My wife and I bought the G35 as a retirement car in anticipation of taking long road trips | We have been extremely satisfied with the comfort and convenience of this car | We particularly like the navigation system and other technology features such as the color back-up camera and CD changer | This is our first luxury vehicle and we enjoy the feeling when we hand the car over to the parking attendant at our favorite upscale restaurants in Atlanta | 
 "words": Super impressed with this car so far | We've owned Mercedes S CLK E Class Jaguars and Audis in the past and are tired of paying 200 for a key-fob | Switched to Japanese for the reliability factor | and | there's not many of these on the road vs | 3- series BMW | Quicker 0-60 than my 99' CLK 430 | Would have paid another 20K for a similar model Lexus | 
 "words": I have had this car over a year and am still in that new car love with it | The 306 HP engine puts out TONS of power so much it has turned me in to one of those people who speeds anywhere and everywhere | I have driven tons and tons of cars and have never driven one this fast | As the dealer said it is a sports car with a sedan body | The interior of the car is equally as stunning as the performance | All of the functions including the navigation are extremely easy to use | We love the iPod dock in the center console as well as the ability to use an external flash drive to import music into the car's memory for playback | The seats are overly comfortable and roomy all around | 
 "words": I am very happy with this car | Solid ride quiet nice interior | Visually distinct lines on the car | Very responsive steering | Transmission shifts are smooth and close together | Coming off a 2003 Audi A6 the build and ride quality of the G35X seems much better | Averaging 20 mpg in mixed driving | 
 "words": I have been a Maxima guy for years and never thought I could afford a G | I've always liked the looks of the G35 so I decided to test drive one | It was all over after that | WOW is all I had to say | I bought the 08 early this year because of the rebates only paid 32K for it with the Sport and Premium packages | I still have my 03 Maxima which I like alot but I let my sister drive it for now because I just can't see letting it sit and sit it would as long as I have a car like the G | The VLSD vicious limited-slip differential and paddle shifters add to the FUN factor for sure | I'm 29 and feel like a kid in a candy store every time I get in my car | 
 "words": Everyone that is in the know about cars says this is the car to give the BMW 3 series a run for the money | Rubbish | This car is quicker sexier and cheaper than its German counterpart | Plus I haven't even got to the interior | Driving a BMW is like driving something an engineer built to a specification | Driving the G35 is like something a engineer designed and then an interior designer architect and artist redesigned | Its performance characteristics are superb but more importantly the car engages you | Its beautiful curves and attention to design and detail creates an experience | Remember we as humans like things that look like us | The car looks like a supermodel | 
 "words": Just hit the 5000 mile mark and love the car more and more each day | I receive so many compliments on the car with most indicating that the car must have been very expensive based on it's looks | People assume this car was very expensive even though it's priced at or below the price of the vehicle they are actually driving themselves | 
 "words": I looked at Audi Lexus no comparison when you factor in everything | 
 "words": Absolutely fabulous and a huge step forward from the 2003 G35 my wife drives | The interior is just below Lexus level but not by much | The premium navigation commmunications package is truly wonderful | The engine has rocketship thrust even if it's a little unrefined compared to BMW Lexus and Audi | I have been averaging 20 mpg on the highway and am driving like a regular guy nothing too crazy and not like Grandpa | If you can get the sports package just for the seats if nothing else | Bar raised | 
 "words": Superb acceleration and holds the road well | A good looking car with features you can't find at the price | I chose this over the Acura TL | The TL is a quieter driving experience but it doesn't have the raw power and machismo of the G35 | 
 "words": Having owned 2 BMWs 3 5 series along with an Audi allroad I have a frame of reference to compare the German ownership experience with that of the 2008 G35 sport premium and navigation packages | Nothing can touch a Bimmer coursing through the S curves but my new G 35S is a powerful sedan that hopefully will provide years of satisfaction | This car is simply gorgeous and packs more technological features that cars costing many thousands more | I am very satisfied with my purchase | 
 "words": I love this car | Drove BMW Lexus Cadillac this beat them all hands down | A great value | This car handles so great I never thought I would enjoy my daily commute | I have never had so many people tell me they love my car | Have to drive one to truly apperciate how great this car is | 
 "words": The G35S 6MT is one of the finest luxury sedans in its class and with attractive pricing comparable to the BMW 328 it certainly is closing the gaps in quality performance and affordability | My G35S is fully loaded with aftermarket chrome detail work | Since my purchase I have been ecstatic and have woken up everyday with a smile on my face | The interior is exceptional in both design and comfort | With more standard luxury options and equipment than the 328 such as HID Xenon headlights leather upholstery and keyless entry with push-button start | Bottom line if you can live without the prestigious German nameplate the best value for your money is the Infiniti G35 Sport 6MT | 
 "words": I love my New G-Ride I love all the added up grades | I was shopping around the car market and nothing caught my eye until I drove this car | I love the G35 it has everything I ever wanted in a car | The only thing is gas stinks but who cars we only live once driving a fast car pay off in California | LOVE It | 
 "words": I'm a little disappointed by my G35S | It's a great car with an excellent engine nice interior great exterior all the gadgets and a posh sound system | But it has several HUGE flaws horrible transmission and clutch | First of all it is VERY hard to launch it smoothly and quetly too much throttle and it surges like a bull too little and it shakes like its got an overdose | Let go throttle at 1st gear and instead of slow smooth engine braking you get uneven and abrupt deceleration horrible feeling and you look like a fool too | Second very LOUD drivetrain noise | Third under hard acceleration the car starts to shake violently as the tires gain and loose the grip very disappointing | 
 "words": I bought the 2008 Infiniti G35 with the Premium Nav Sport packages | This is by far the most fun car I've ever had the pleasure to drive | From the excellently designed body to the excellently detailed interior this car has it all | It has a wonderful balance of luxury and sport mixed together | The interior is fantastic with the sport package if you like the more modern feel | If you like the luxury feel more I would not get the sport package because the seats are firm but very solid | If you want a better performance you need to get the sport package | Either way this car is such a wonderful balance of both worlds | Excellent car | 
 "words": AMAZING engine with immediately ready torque and speed | With this comes less than average fuel economy and that is ok you can't have both | I think it's doing around 18 overall and for those of you who ride about 5-8 mph over the speed limit you'll be at 3200rpm at 75 mph | Like I said it's the trade off you get for such a hungry engine | I'm not sure if a 6th gear would fix this but I think that may make this car perfect | The tan leather with real wood trim is very rich looking | Easy to use nav controls | Simply put it's the most fun car I've ever driven and it's not even close add Japanese reliability for icing on the cake | Bravo Infiniti | 
 "words": I traded in my BMW 323i for this car and about the only regret that I have is that this car is a bit longer other than that what a car | It's also great that I got a great deal on it | You get so much for your money with this car | I got the Premium Package and the Nav | Package and think they're both great | I had debated buying the car without the Nav | package and then buying a portable device but I'm happy I went with the built-in as they tie in so many other things to it | Since I listen to music a lot I'm really happy with the music choices iPod Compact Disk radio or CDs | And this car has the power when you put your foot on the gas | 
 "words": I got my 2008 Infiniti G35xS with the navigation and sport package along with a spoiler | I am coming from driving a powerful Mustang GT with a V8 and a lot of horsepower | And I must say this car is hands down my favorite car that I have ever driven | This was my dream car and I found a way to get it | This car packs more features then any car I have ever seen and for the price completely knocks out BMW Lexus and Audi | I had test driven every single car in the class from the 325xi Lexus IS350 Caddy CTS and Audi S4 | I have to say without a doubt the G35 is hands down the best car | Infiniti rocks | 
 "words": Just took delivery on a G35x with Premium package and nav | Although I have only put a few hundred miles on it so far it is everything I expected and then some | I test drove a Lexus IS 250 AWD a Lexus IS 350 an Audi A4 2 | 0T quattro and the Saab 9-3 just to name a few and this car blows them all away in every category | So far I could not be happier with my purchase | 
 "words": I'm very happy with our purchase | Yes mileage is not that great but it's still better than my truck and there's more horsepower too | My lone complaint is that it's primarily my wife's daily driver and not mine | But that's hardly Infiniti's fault | 
 "words": I traded in my 2002 BMW M3 2 door for the 2008 G35x Sport needed a 4 door car for a baby | So far I really do like the car and coming from an M3 the performance is right up there | Other cars I looked at were the BMW 335ix and Lexus IS350 | Both were OVER 10k more expensive and the Infiniti had more features | I really like the interior of this car too far more than the 10k more expensive BMW | Seats are very comfortable and it has a nice high-end look to it without the price | I think you cannot go wrong with this car for 38k 300 HP great interior nav stereo keyless start etc | 
 "words": Just purchased my 2008 Infiniti G35S Journey on 01 24 08 | I don't have any cons to report except for the snug interior and narrow seats but that's why they call it a sports sedan | This car ROCKS | It is very fast and a very attractive vehicle | I traded in a 2007 Maxima SE and haven't looked back since | My G35 turns heads and at takeoff will pin your head back | I wish I could find a raceway so that I can really stretch it out | I would highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who's in the market for a car well worth the money | It's cheaper than a Lexus and the BMW | Neither one of them compares as far as price and performance are concerned | 
 "words": Everything as expected | No surprises | Lots of fun driving | 
 "words": After spending some time looking my wife and i bought the same G35 Sport 2008 | Comfort handling and technology | All superb | If your into music entertainment systems in your car youll find the technology package to be impressive | Not to mention a very quick 306 engine and race car like suspension | I can't wait to get past my 500 break-in miles to see what i really have | 
 "words": Dealership brought out our 2005 TSX lease and looking for something with more torque and horsepower | Came down between TL-S or G35x finally decided on a G35X w sport package premium pack and nav | We didn't want to go through the rattling problem with Honda cars | Love the sporty look of the G35X with the 18 rim and the safty of all-wheel drive living here in jersey | So far no complain we had three honda automobiles and this car feels much tighter build | No more rattle from my previous two cars tsx and accord | Looking forward to drive it everyday | Can't wait pass the 500 break-in miles and let the throttle open on the highway | 
 "words": I needed a reliable sporty family-friendly car to replace my Audi S4 which I loved from a local dealership and had ruled out the repair-prone German imports at least for this purchase cycle | This car fits the bill | Reliable | Stylish | Excellent performer | Unbeatable technology | Great buying and dealership experience | Highly recommended |

 "words": This is an extremely sharp handling and undeniably quick sports car that just happens to have 4 doors and AWD | Though it may be a personal preference but pictures do not do justice to the lines and form of this car like flowing water caught in an instant | Roomy inside for this segment and comfortable without excess | Premium and Navigation packages are a must | This is not a super-car but its highly capable and not overpriced | You can judge for yourself definitely take a test drive | 
 "words": There is no better value in the Entry-Level Luxury Sedan genre than the Infiniti G35 | I have the Journey trim with the Sport Package | Awesome | Better than I expected | Great ride powerful quick and a real head turner | Interior is beautiful too | After looking at Acura TL 3-Series BMW and others there is really no comparison | Only downside is MPG | I am getting about 19 living in congested Washington DC spending 50 of time in city driving conditions | German manufacturers beware | The G35 delivers luxury and performance that Lexus and Acura cannot match |

 "words": G35 value beat A4 TL Accord BMW 3 | Exterior design very seductive except black patches in front air dam | Keyless locks start button are amazing | Excellent interior design | quality and ergonomics | Driver memory system is awesome | Excellent fit finish | Accelerator a bit touchy but wow love the torque | Handling is amazing | Ipod interface is just OK | Lighting scheme very cool | Tranny lacks refinement with thump | from 2nd to 3rd under hard driving | Add a 6th gear 70mph runs at 3200 rpms | Getting about 18mpg in mixed driving 23 hwy at 75mph | This is a performance vehicle | Has room for improvements but for 10k less than Lexus IS350 or BMW 3 it can't be beat | 
 "words": Had a Mercedes ML500 that was dead in the garage 3 times with only 23000 miles on it | Had to change cars | I had Infinitis before and they were all great never any problems and great dealer service | This g35x is the best one yet | I love driving it and it has so many great tech items on the car |

 "words": Premium nav | I test drove both this car and the FX | Wasn't thrilled at the idea of 15mpg or the bigger price tag | This car accelerates wonderfully and I'm not worried about sway as I was with my SUV | 
 "words": In looking for a new sport sedan to purchase I knew in the back of my mind that I would probably get the new G35 | After I test drove it it was a no-brainer | Everything that I was looking for in a car and less expensive than other cars I was looking at | It looks good from any angle on the outside with a roomy and quiet cabin on the inside | The center console is logically arranged plus it looks awesome at night | The clutch is smooth and quiet the shifter is short and sweet and an excellent driving position is easily found with 12-way power seat | Back seat is roomy enough | Has plenty of technology if you opt for the NAV PREM and TECH packages |

 "words": Test drove the 335xi as a benchmark | It's a great driving car but the inputs are all touchy and the interior made me feel claustrophobic and it's pretty barren | G35 wasn't on the top of my list simply because I've never cared for Nissan products in the past | But I told myself to give it a try and boy am I glad I did | This car has a far nicer interior than the Bimmer more features for less money and achieves 95 of the performance without a turbo | Handling is spot on although steering could use some work | Ride is firm but body motions are well controlled and bumps are noticeable rather than jarring | This thing wants to be driven hard | I just wish we had no speed limit | 
 "words": Before everything else test drive this car right away | It feels superior to drive and handles excellent | Gas mileage is surprisingly efficient | Driving with the 6 speed manual transmission is a little tricky as the car feels extra responsive to your every move so it can take a little getting used to even though I've driven a manual for years |

 "words": Just picked it up today in liquid platinum | Wasn't looking into all the different packages | The journey comes with everything a person can need and despite not having moonroof a 6-disc in dash changer with mp3 capability along with a roaring 306hp was all I needed and wanted | Fell in love with back in april and finally made a great deal on it | Hoping for it to be a great car for a while to come | 
 "words": I have been eyeing the G series ever since the first one came out | My 1998 Accord finally gave me fits so it was a chance to hop into a G35 | I had a great deal on the 2008 vs | a 2009 so I decided to pull the trigger | I love the interior and the color scheme | The Premium package is a must | I like the G35S but at 2200 more I decided to go without | I love the way it looks and the manu-shifting is great | Not as instantaneous as a 6MT but I rarely race if ever | All in all would definitely do it again | Didn't care much for the navigation already have an awesome 200 Garmin and the CF slot | With an iPod and an MP3 CD player who needs CF |

 "words": Just hit 4K miles and got the 1st oil change | I got the Sport package | The car seems to now loosen up a bit giving it a higher FUN-TO-DRIVE | My 2006 6MT was more fun to drive but this 09 xS edition is slowly catching up 
 "words": Leased the 08 G35 Journey with Premium Package liquid platinum is the perfect color for this vehicle | My decision was between the '09 Acura TL and the G35 | There was no comparison between these two vehicles when evaluating features and performance for the money | The G offered 306 hp smart key upgraded leather seats | 
 "words": I admit I'm biased I wanted the G since I saw the first photos of the 2007 model | I waited out the lease on my previous vehicle then searched for more than a month to find a 6spd Sport | I live in upstate NY and took delivery in late November at the start of snow season | after nearly 2 months I have no regrets about buying RWD | A set of Blizzaks all around plus VDC and a light touch on the throttle and clutch and I haven't had a problem at all | The G is everything I wanted | stylish sophisticated RWD 6MT with all the tech gadgets I could ask for | A friend rode in it and commented Nice but not a BMW or Audi | Which is exactly why I bought it | 
 "words": I looked hard at BMW Audi and Infiniti when I was looking for a new car | Each had similar driving characteristics but I ended up with the G35 because of the value of the content for the price | Living in Minnesota the AWD feature was important and the addition of the Premium Navigation and Sport packages the price just couldn't be beat | Great linear acceleration with the right sounds | Sticky in the corners with the granny system on but easy hang the rear out when you turn it off | Beautiful looks outside nice inside | AWD is great in the winter with the all-seasons | The nav system is restricted from most functions when the car is in motion thanks to the lawyers really annoying | 
 "words": I am writing this review after 6 months of driving | I love the car and did a bunch of shopping prior to my purchase | I live in MN so an AWD or FWD vehicle was a must | I test drove the following vehicles prior to my choice of the g35x | Honda Accord Coupe Nissan Maxima Lexus IS250 awd Lexus ES350 and Nissan Altima | The G35 was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles | I drive in Minneapolis rush hour daily and the snow mode comes in quite handy when the weather takes a turn for the worst | I constantly try to lose control in this vehicle on secluded country roads and it's almost impossible | 
 "words": This car is for people who love to drive | Acceleration is fantastic | Handling and braking are smooth | Very tight turning radius for a car this size | Road noise is a little more prevalent than in competitor's models but not bad overall | You can feel the transmission shifts a bit | This car has a lot of power for a 5-speed | Likely corrected with the 7-speed in the '09 | For me the MPG has been trending at 17 over the first two months of ownership | I'm a little on the aggressive side but previous cars haven't penalized me as much as this one does | 
 "words": This G35S with summer tires would not survive in a snow storm | I'm battling with Nissan with a suspension steering or tracking problem as this car is way too sensitive to road crown compared to every car I've driven it drives straight in the right lane but would crash into the woods next to the left lane as soon as the hands are off the steering wheel after alignment done on it 3 times Nissan is refusing to acknowledge this quality defect while all 3 of their loaner cars I've driven drove without this problem I would trade it in for an AWD especially living in the NE a RWD just won't cut it in snow | It's worse than a Maxima SE don't waste your money
 "words": I am 16 years old and I received this as my first car | I got the black on black with navigation and all those nice amenities | This is for sure an amazing car | I only have around 2500 miles on it | It's a quick and cool car | I have one of the nicest cars and campus and its definitely a head turner for other teenagers | In the 4 months I have had it it has been good to me besides a few unfortunate scratches | Not a single dent when I got hit in the parking lot | Quality | 
 "words": This is an excellent choice for anyone wanting a performance sedan that's usable in daily life | The performance is stunning but it seats four comfortably and has a reasonable trunk | The suspension is more sporty than luxury | Selectable comfort sport suspension settings would be nice | Overall this is one of the best cars you can get on a normal budget | 
 "words": Hadn't planned on buying the G35 always lusted after it though | I bought an 06 325i | Frustrated dumped it in 08 too many trips to the shop | Looked at the Maxima never a fan but liked the new look in 09 LOVED it but couldn't pay 37K more than the G | Drove the G power kicks the 325 | Who needs this sort of power | The brakes lovely the growl exhilarating and no tranny lag when punched | Smooth sure footed though not as much on mountain roads as the BMW and quiet | The drive train hump encroaches into the foot-well so front passenger's left leg foot tilts at an odd angle | Front doors close solidly rear doors sound tinny | 
 "words": If you get this car I highly recommend the Premium Package | It includes the completely integrated iPod hookup Lexus does not a sunroof upgraded stereo and more comfortable seats with the seat assist feature | My first car was a Camry so the 306 hp performance is a definite upgrade | I love being able to pass and merge at will | MPG has been 20 mpg so far vs 30 with my 4 cyl Camry | This is not a full size car so if you are going to have frequent backseat guests you might consider something larger | A few of my friends have BMWs but they were very impressed with the look and performance of this car | For the money I don't think it can be beat | 
 "words": Purchased our vehicle last week the wife and I absolutely love it | It is very responsive and has a nice smooth ride | The acceleration is outstanding as well as all the bells and whistles | Love the voice recognition blue tooth and navigation | It is a bit annoying that you cannot input directions on the nav while on the move but we'll get over it | If you are in the market to purchase a car I recommend you take a look at this car | There is not a vehicle out there that has the features that the G35 comes with at such an affordable price | Awesome job Infiniti | 
 "words": I wanted a vehicle with reasonable performance all wheel drive navigation and adaptive or intelligent cruise control | After factoring in reasonable price Edmunds Incentives and Rebates section saved me thousands the list became a toss up between the EX35 or the G35X | I chose the G35X as it has been on Car and Drivers 10 best list | Great car | Infiniti offers more technology and performance for the price than any other make | My dealer experience has been very pleasant also | 
 "words": I researched cars for a long time | I did own a Passat and it was fine but I was tired of the Euro quirks and expensive repairs | I wanted an all-wheel drive car with good technological features as well as something that I could DRIVE | I looked at another Passat but the V6 4-Motion was as much as this car | Easy decision there | This has been a great car so far | Love the acceleration and the handling | The interior is first rate | When compared to the BMW 3xi or the A4 it hands down the best value | More horsepower more features less money | 
 "words": This is a great looking car with good performance but my main reason for buying it was all the gadgets that come with the car | The problem is many of these gadgets get locked out while driving | You can't make changes to the navigation system while driving | How crazy is that | Where would you use your navigation system in your driveway | The car allows you to sync your phone book from your cell phone to the car but you can't use the sync phone book to place calls while driving | When would you use this in your driveway again | Infiniti is doing this in the name of safety but a car company's job is not to play big brother | 
 "words": Researched and looked for almost 6 mos before deciding on the G35x | I drove the BMW 3 series Lexus IS 350 Honda Accord Pontiac G8 GT Toyota Camry | and by far the Infiniti G35x outperformed all of them | It was the only one I walked away from being blown away by | Also for the money compared to the 3 series it is a steal | You are not going to find a sports sedan with all this offers for a better price | Period | I'm 6'4 and I'm very comfortable in the G35x |

 "words": We test drove a lexus IS 250 2009 Maxima and the Infiniti G35 with AWD | Could not believe the feeling you get from driving this car | While gas mileage is subpar my feeling is that I did not buy this car with the gas mileage as the primary concern | Love the Nav system AWD as we live in the Northeast and the looks I get when I pull into a parking space | Highway driving is fun as the car has a tight feel to it and is very responsive | By far the best car and value in its class |

 "words": Trading in my 2005 G35 6MT that I upgraded from 298HP to 350HP for a 2008 G35xS was a bit concerning because I wanted the same horse power feel and was concerned the sedan would lack the 'feeling one' with the car experience | I also needed something for winter | I will say I'm really surprised by how responsive the automatic 306HP of the sedan deploys itself | Having said that I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this car to the G35xS which adds the 18 wheels and the paddle shifters | I will say the car comes to life when in manual mode much differently then just driving in automatic | With that I will say I'm quite happy and the car now provides the same confidence my previous G did |
