 "words": After driving an 06 SL55 AMG I traded my fully optioned and modified 04 CLK55 AMG for this fully optioned car with the 030 Performance Package | I had it less than a month when it was totaled on 12 31 08 | I am so impressed by this car I bought an 07 SL55 AMG with the 030 and all options after the insurance claims were settled | For comparison I tested the 09 Shelby GT500KR 09 Chev Corvette Z06 07 BMW 650i convt 08 BMW 550 Sport and an 08 SL550 Sport | I even considered an 08 CLK63 Black Series | Personally I think the SLs are great cars that can do everything very well | Although it is not as nimble as my previous 03 BMW M5 and 02 M3 its still my 1st choice | It's stablemate is a great 05 E55 | 
 "words": I never would have paid the MSRP for this car new but as a 2 year old lease return with less than 15K for 50 of MSRP it seemed reasonable | The balance of performance and luxury comfort is very impressive | It's very comfortable as a luxo- cruiser but only a short throttle stab away from a rear-end sliding beast | I've had BMW's and S-version Audi's before and this time I looked at used AM Vantage's poor warranty and M6's sorry just not very attractive and considered 911's as wellyes it's more of a sports car but as a daily luxo driver in urban traffic that is still capable of lots of hard-top down rip-snorting fun this is a very tough car to beat | especially for 1 2 off | 
 "words": The power of 510 ponies cannot be beat when you're behind a truck along side a slow poke or just dying to feel the wind in your hair | Tons of truck space all the bells tolerable gas mileage and fun fun fun | Just wish people didn't park right next to me all the time | 
 "words": Due to its active suspension ABC it can cruise like a S-class but it stiffens up for almost no lean in the fun twistees and corners-Amazing | The transmission senses when you need punch and adjusts to your driving style by the second-a great feature since your driving reactions can be so dynamic in today's crazy traffic | You can adjust the way the car handles from comfort to sport including ride height with a push of a button | The 7 speed auto- transmission can also be changed from comfort to sport for that all-out sports car performance | Great V8 engine- very smooth but has incredible low range torque and all the power you might want | 
 "words": Overall a great luxury sports touring car | Due to its active suspension ABC it can cruise like a S-class but it stiffens up for almost no lean in the fun twistees and corners-Amazing | The transmission senses when you need punch and adjusts to your driving style by the second-a great feature since your driving reactions can be so dynamic in today's crazy traffic | You can adjust the way the car handles from comfort to sport including ride height with a push of a button | 
 "words": I traded a '07 Corvette fully loaded it was a great American car but no comparison to my new SL 550 | Performance handling quality interior and exterior are beyond my expectations | I have had many MB automobiles since my first 1988 this is by far the best | 
 "words": This is my third SL-class car I have owned in the past 3 years | I would have never gotten an SL55 except for the large price mark-down from the sticker since this is a lease return | This car obviously has the most power 510 hp and thus the first time I floored the pedal I said WOW | This car does move | The motorized hard top is definitely cool and makes the car versatile | It is also luxurious inside | Finally this car is expensive | Thus fun fancy and frivolous | 
 "words": My 2007 is a much better vehicle than my 2003SL | While the styling is similar the new 7 speed transmition is fabulously smooth the additional horsepower of the 550 vs | the old 500 is very noticable and the handling greatly improved | Also improved is the breaking which has eliminated the annoying cluncking sound and hesitation experienced in the 2003 | Still a problem seems to be the computer system operating the ABC active body control system | It was a constant problem with my 2003 and unfortunately has once more shown up on my 2007 | The car was in the shop for 2 weeks while the computer part was flown in from Germany | Aside from this one electrical problem the car is fantastic | 
 "words": I say near because the audio and nav system perform and look like equipment several generations old | Programming involves unnecessary steps the screen is bland with minimal color levels and it completely washes out in sunlight which obviously is a detriment in a convertible | The system won't even provide street labeling unless fully zoomed in to max detail | The radio functions are only average and sound is mediocre | The system needs more speakers with improved sub woofers and tweeters | To make up for these deficiencies the interior and exterior is a work of art | Coupled with the increased power and improved handling it's near automotive nirvana on a warm Sunday top down drive | 
 "words": This is also my 3rd SL of this series prev '04 and '06 | Tried to swith to either XKR or 650 | Just not comparable | Love the improved handling firmer brakes and increased power | Quality still perfect | Note to other buyers | Make sure you get the Michelin Tires versus Continentals | Better ride |

 "words": I had a Lexus SC430 leased for the last 4 years and I had been looking for a relacement | The Lexus was my first experience with a Non North American car | It was fun for a long time but did not give me the real sports car feeling | My Silver red int | SL550 with AMG sport pack and Pan Roof is a dream | Great power very responsive performance and handling is superior | The gas mileage is about the same as the SC430 but I have almost 100 more HP much better handling and it's more fun to drive | I had tried the Jag the BMW 6 and the Porsche but settled on the SL550 | After 4 months I know I made the right decision | 
 "words": This is absolutely amazing | To integrate total luxury with total performance in an automatic is an achievement | The handling is exceptional particularly in sharp turns | 
 "words": This is my first SL and I love it | The car moves like it's connected directly to my brain | Steering is smooth and responsive | The engine and tranmission deliver loads of power and braking is firm but well controlled | When you add in the superb fit and finish of the car the amazing hardtop convertible some of the sweetest exterior looks on the road and this car is just fun to drive | Sure there are a couple of things that could have been designed better but they really aren't bad they way they are now | 
 "words": This is the best roadster I have ever driven | I've owned Lexus Corvette NSX BMW and most recently the '07 Jaguar | The SL 550 is vastly superior to them all | The SL has an incredible combination of sport and luxury | The interior is as nice or nicer than anything out there | The car handles superbly and yet still has a very comfortable ride | The seats are among the best I've ever seen | You can easily drive all day without killing your back | The only drawbacks to the SL are the price poor mileage and inexcusably a very mediocre stereo and outdated NAV | But the superior driving experience more than compensates for these shortfalls | Drive one it's worth the money | 
 "words": I picked up the silver SL550 with the AMG sport package panoramic roof and red interior Thursday Aug | 17 | 2006 | I turned in my leased 02 Lexus SC430 which was the best car I ever owned for quality and fun | At this point 1200 miles I am still pinching myself | Awesome performance and I love just to stare at it | The gas mileage I had read was bad but already I don't notice any difference from my Lexus 430 V8 | The only thing I miss from the Lexus is the tilting down rear view mirrors when reversing | 
 "words": Traded 2005 SL500 on 2007 SL550 | As nice as the '05 was the new '07 is more powerful quieter' and has a much better steering feel | 
 "words":  I previously owned a 2005 SL500 | The car is indeed more powerful reflecting the increase in horsepower | I actually do not like some of the minor interior changes | For instance I do not like the change in the hard-top controller handle-switch | The previous switch had a red light incorporated in it to indicate when the up or down function was complete | The current switch no longer has this light indicator and now you must turn your head around to look | I cannot figure out if the current model has voice control or not while the '05 model voice control was standard | I do like the bluetooth module allowing use of your personal phone | 
 "words": Terrific automobile | Only dissapointment is the technology used in the navigation system | It is at lease two generations behind Lexus | 
 "words": The 07 SL 55 has subtle but great improvements over prior model years | The paddle shift is much better than the button set up on the prior AMG | The ride with 19 inch rims is very smooth for a performance car | Best of all it is somewhat stealth at least here in So Cal as there are so many SL's running around | My only disappointment is that the navi is still somewhat behind that of Acura and the sound system is good but not great | In a 130 K car you would think the sound system would be as good as the exhaust sound | All in all this is a dream car and feel lucky to own one | Prior car was an 02 E55 and still love it but not a much as this SL 55 Duh | 
 "words": The addition of 50 HP has made a huge difference in this car | I owned an '05 SL500 and the second you touch the gas pedal you can feel the difference | This car moves and handles perfectly | There have been slight alterations in the body style mostly to the front grill and the interior feels roomier | It remains a car for the ages |
