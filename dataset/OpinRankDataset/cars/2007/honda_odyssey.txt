REVIEWS
 "words": It has almost been three years as we purchased this in 11 06 and this is our 5th Odyssey | We normally trade after 24 months but we felt we drive this one until the wheels fall off | Well we are at 104K and its still drives like a brick | Sure gas mileage could be better but with all the conveniences that the van offers | If I wanted el cheapo I'd get a KIA | Yeah brakes shutter as the brakes get warped quick | well it is a 4000lb tank | I have NO regrets | 
 "words": I own a 2007 Odyssey with 20000 miles on it which I purchased new | I've had two mechanical issues so far | The first was with a noisy power-steering unit | The noise was caused by a faulty power steering fluid reservoir which allowed air to get into the system | The second issue is with the transmission | It shutters at 20 40 mph under very light pedal applications | I had it to the dealer once so far without a fix | I believe it is an issue with the cylinder deactivation system | A friend had a similar issue and had their active engine mounts replaced | I may start there with the dealer on my next visit | Fuel economy is poor | Avg | 16 17 around town 18 on vacation trip loaded down | 
 "words": I've owned Hondas in the past and found them reliable so I blindly chose the Odyssey when it was time for a minivan | Big mistake | This huge mini van drove like a bus was difficult to park and had problems the dealer was not able to fix | At 20K miles the rotors warped the front tires had to be replaced and the front wheels were constantly out of balance | At 25K miles the engine mounts failed followed by the torque converter and the A C | It vibrated all the time while driving and the dealer could do no more | Reading the reviews on this model year I found I'm not the only one with these problems | I just traded it in on a Sienna and have never been happier | 
 "words": We leased a 2004 and currently leasing again a 2007 Honda Odyssey | The 2004 Odyssey never gave us any mechanical or electrical troubles | So far the problem with our 2007 Odyssey was a shorted electrical fuse which led to replacing the factory-installed battery | And since then everything is perfectly okay | My family and I love this car because it possess enough power comfortable to drive roomy and has an excellent safety features | Generally Honda Odyssey or any other Japanese cars are very reliable | 
 "words": We've had this ody since July 2007 it is our 2nd ody | We have had only minor problems problems with the back bumper after dealer installed trailer wiring and that's it | Only changed the oil and rotated the tires | No shaking pulling hesitation etc | just a good all around vehicle | I average 19 | 2mpg city and hwy | The vehicle's traction control works great up here in Alaska but I do use dedicated studded snow tires | Road noise is much better than the last model 2002 ody but still noticeable actually it's not much quieter than my 2005 ford diesel | Kids love the car too we put an alpine dvd player in it which is easy for them to use | So this vehicle is easy to like | 
 "words": Van drives like a truck | Bad front end | New tires did not help | Dealership just makes excuses | Brakes squeak and factory rep and dealership say to read the owners manual and it will say you may have squeaky brakes | They will not correct them | Owners manual comes after the purchase | How dumb is that | 
 "words": Like many other owners we too are having transmission issues | We just had to the dealer for the transmission judder fix but guess what | It's worse than it was before | Vehicle shakes at 25 MPH while transmission hunts for a gear especially on hills | There is also an intermittent shake at highway speeds 70 MPH that I no longer believe has anything to do with tires or alignment but with the drivetrain itself | Like others when entering exiting ECO mode there is too much noise from the transmission | The VCM system does not seem to improve gas mileage so I say Honda should eliminate it | We've had 7 Hondas now and this is the first and only Odyssey we will own | 
 "words": We purchased this van brand new without knowing that the tire system was different | All four tires unevenly wear out after 20000 miles on it e | g | they wear out on one edge of the tires but not the other side | I brought it to Firestone and it was said that the alignment was bad which killed the tired | I brought it to Honda's dealer and all they said was that they were not responsible and I had to pay nearly 1500 to replay a new tire | It's sad | We have purchased 4 Honda and surely this van would be the last one | In addition this van is not very fuel economy e | g | 20 miles on freeway and 15 miles in the city bad | Don't purchase it if you don't want to pay more than it's worth | 
 "words": Sorry to blast a vehicle that is so highly rated but mine has had recurring problems and they appear to be electrical | When I turn the lights on the dash lights go off | the cruise control only works on occasion | have been to Dealer 3 times to correct a bad tire pressure sensor-still not working and light still on | the battery has been replaced twice in a year | All in all this is my first and probably last Honda product because it has left me stranded 8 times in one year with a dead battery | My 14 yr old Quest never stranded me once | 
 "words": This was my replacement for a domestic van we had owned | I think the American brands will return to the top soon if this Honda van is any indication | Van has 23k mi currently and has a series of issues | Bad fuel economy trans problems engine pinging | My service reps all respond to these problems like its news to me | However once you inform them of the tech serv bulletin TSB they relent | I think Honda needs to get back in the game with superior eng and quality | This is my 5th Honda and possibly my last | I hope Honda steps up to the plate with this warranty | 
 "words": If you need a minivan | this is definitely the one to buy | so practical high quality | it carries so much stuff that it would be difficult to go back to a sedan | We had an Accord | then we had a baby | if you need to cart babies and baby stuff around its great | I'm a bit disappointed in fuel economy | I can't squeeze better than 23mpg | even when I try really hard
 "words": We recently purchased a 2007 Odyssey to replace our 2002 Odyssey which was totalled in an accident | We have not been as happy with the 2007 as we were with the 2002 | The 2007 is bulkier to drive harder to park shifts rough between 20-30 km h and uses way more gas | 14-17 mpg in city driving is what we are getting and we were told it would be better than that | We are truly disappointed with the gas mileage of the 07 | How can a vehicle be fun to drive when you can literally see the gas gauge moving towards empty as you are driving | 
 "words": After owning a 2000 Odyssey definitely wanted to own 2007 model | When it comes to comfort and convenience this is the best van out there | Car and driver rated this van 1 in its category | Smooth and quiet excellent ride great handling for a van | To me it's like driving a big Accord | Definitely a winner in my book | 
 "words": We just bought this 07 Odyssey and have only had it 1 week but so far this vehicle is very well built extremely comfortable and performs and handles very well for a minivan | First tank of gas I averaged 20 mpg with mostly city driving | I'm expecting this to improve as the engine breaks in | I read one review that said they got 14mpg on a tank and I couldn't believe it how were you driving | In fact most of the negatives I read about this vehicle was on gas mileage but I guess those people never owned SUV's | I traded a Mitsubishi Endeavor SUV which was a great vehicle but we wanted the extra seats and better fuel mileage | So far so good | I'll write another review when I get more miles | 
 "words": Mileage on the sticker is a pure lie and cheating | In growing family the gas expense is burden now | When asked dealer they said 16 for city and highway combined is good | Per dealer can get sticker mileage if driven without A C heater radio navigation DVD and at smooth 55mph | Sure why do they have these feature than | Why are they selling in cold Chicago | If DVD has to be off why put it in | Minor touch of metal or so creates dent due to thin paint coat | No MP3 format player no iPod outlet for such an expensive vehicles | Does not have mileage calculator built into Nav system | Same software used in Acura and others should have throwns into this | 
 "words": Bought the Ody after test-driving the Ody and the Sienna | Love the handling drives like a large Accord | Fuel consumption is a major setback | Getting approx 14 gallon with 60 40 highway local driving | Lack of quality control when leaving plant | Had to bring the vehicle back to dealer to correct manufacturing defects and imperfections | 
 "words": Pleasantly surprised at handling and comfort of this minivan after trading in my Lexus GX470 for it | Need seating for grandkid visits | 8 passenger option a real plus | Would have bought the Touring model except for the run flat tires | 
 "words": Except for the driver's armrest it's a fairly comfortable car and we really like it but it could be better | I get the feeling Honda tried to save costs at the expense of consumers' comfort and convenience | Honda took out the revolving tray in the floor space and the adjustable armrests which were features in the 2006 Honda EX | The driver's armrest is not very good | For the exterior they should have racks with the roof rails | 
 "words": Honda Odyssey rides better than my 05 Dodge Grand Caravan | Engine is smooth fuel economy is great | Small amount of road noise not serious | Overall very satisfied | 
 "words": Good acceleration steering and suspension for a minivan | Minor creaking and body flex noise when starting from a stop | Also when stopping transmission is clunky and feels like it is pushing you forward | Overall by far the best reliable performance for the money | Was surprised about the clunky transmission for a Honda | Highway mileage so far 24 | 5 at 75-80 mph-not bad for a 5200lb | vehicle loaded with a V-6 | Rear DVD is worth its weight in gold for kids | Radio signal reception is poor | More road noise than I expected | 
 "words": Purchased minivan as the family was growing | Anyone who rides in the van especially the kids find the van to be comfortable for long rides | Found good value in van due to the number of options available in the EX-L | 
 "words": I bought my Odyssey by using Edmund's multiple dealer quotes method and easily got mine way below the invoice price | It was so much fun driving this vehicle | And my kids now see car ride as an entertainment thanks to the onboard DVD | I personally love the voice commands that I can use to control pretty much everything so that I can keep my eyes on the road | 
 "words": We were sold on the first test drive this is a beautiful car to drive | Wish we'd stepped up to the Touring for a couple of reasons | 'XM ready' means a 600 installation fee which really annoyed us as frankly false advertising | And it doesn't have automatic headlights | This is not only annoying any old GM car has them but dangerous especially when the dash lights are so bright it makes you thinks the lights are on when they're not | 
 "words": Traded in our 2004 Odyssey for the 2007 version | Love the improvements in design of rear seats driver seat electric 12 v | outlets and usage of space |

 "words": Purchased to get better gas mileage than the SUV did NOT happen | Gas mileage is terrible and we seldom drive over 70 mph | Usually get about 20 mpg on the highway and about 17 in town | Almost identical to SUV | Features are nice and easy to use | Really like the control panel | Ride is comfortable but very noisy | Considering the price would not purchase again due to gas mileage | 
 "words": This is our first Honda | Fortunately we leased the vehicle and it will be going back to the dealer | Nice exterior more than enough power better features over the same priced Toyota | Main complaint the window sticker says MPG 18 25 and we get 14 22 under normal driving conditions 12 MPG in summer when air conditioner is running | We lease vehicles and then buy since we do not trust manufacturers | Honda should be ashamed that they mislead consumers with MPG ratings | This only confirms our suspicions are true | 
 "words": 3 factors led us to buy a minivan | The first was we were expecting a 3rd child and needed a car with more room | The second was we wanted a vehicle that would make our numerous long roadtrips more comfortable than our existing cars Prius and S4 Avant could | And the third was we didn't want a SUV | When considering which minivan to buy we took the advice of so many auto reviewers in the press and plumped for an Odyssey | After more than 6 months of ownership we are largely impressed with the car | 
 "words": We recently bought an 07' Odyssey EX which was replacing a 2004 Tahoe and we're so happy with our new purchase | Much more useable space easier entry exit better gas mileage safety with all of those airbags | We love being able to walk thru b w the front seats to get to the kids in the back | Great acceleration handling for a minivan car-like driving | A few improvements would be larger cup holders in center console minor | Better base stereo system sounds ok but signal not strong- probably weak antenna | Sometimes when slowing down and transmission is downshifting it feels like you get bumped from behind kind of pushes you forward even with the brakes on | All in all very happy 9 10
 "words": We just bought the 2007 Honda Odyssey and I love it | I was driving a 2003 Chevy Tahoe which I thought I couldn't live without until I drove the Odyssey | This van handles wonderfully and is very comfortable not to mention the excellent gas mileage | We traded in our Tahoe because we were so tired of pouring gas into it | At about 70 to fill it up | we were dying | The Odyssey costs about 45 to fill it up | We couldn't beleive it | The road noise is worse than I had hoped our Tahoe was very quiet but was also high off the ground | It is very easy to get my 18 month old in out of the van no more climbing up to load him in his car seat | I love it | even though I said I'd never drive a van | 
 "words": So far 800 miles and enjoy the car | Very roomy with good added features like AC power outlets magic third row | Car is not sporty since it lacks the low torque power but still can handle the roads when needed | Kids love the car with the nav and can't get them to get out | Drives well considering it's a minivan and road pavement is more pronounced since it has pax run flat tires basically a steel tire inside a tire | The ex model is much quieter | 18in wheels are low profile and looks aggressive | The Sienna looks docile | Since we just purchased it will update review when it snows since we live in northeast | Wanted awd but not an option | Can't believe Honda doesn't have one available like Sienna | 
 "words": We have had this van for almost nine moth's and the transmission has had to be rebuilt | The lights in the dash go out evry once in a while when you hit a bump | It rattles | Doesn't want to start when its cold | We were going to buy a Chrysler Town And Country | Wish we did | 
 "words":  had been researching and fallowing Odyssey for last 5 yars and heard nothing but good from the owners and mechanics | Finally I got my own and I love everyting about this van | After having cChevy Astro for 6 annoying years there will be no more GM's in my family | I had the Odyssey for almost three month already and 2600 miles | No complains yet except for the poor gas mileage but I was told it improves with more miles | If you have kids recomend to get a van with DVD player | I bought van without DVD and my wife and I suffer during the long trips | 
 "words":  We have 5 kids and our Pilot was getting too small for the big kids so we looked at the Odyssey | After the first test drive all of the kids were upset we left without buying one our 4 year old cried but we wanted a different color and a little better price | We really love everything inside the van the backup mirror dvd storage space and comfort of the seats in the rear are the best features | If you decide to get accessories for the Odyssey look online first as the exact same ones we were going to get at the dealer are much cheaper online floor mats trim | 
 "words": We have a 2004 Sienna and we thoroughly investigated buying a 2008 Sienna or the 2007 Odyssey | We are glad we chose the Odyssey | The interior and exterior of the car had no defects | Everything in the car works perfectly | My husband likes the smoother acceleration of the Ody over the Sienna | Seats are more comfortable and easier to take out than on the Sienna | The navigation system is excellent | The car handles mountain driving with no problem handles steep grades better than the Sienna |

 "words": This is one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have ever been in | It is noisya constant hummm the transmission runs very rough and the dvd screen constantly squeaks | The van also has a vibration problem which you can feel and easily see when looking at the seats and the steering wheel | It never goes away not even when a c is off | The inside of the van is very nice and roomy | The front seats are way to high for short people though | I am 5'3 and only the tips of my toes touch the floor | Hard to reach pedals Wish I bought something else | Maybe that new toyota that didnt even start at the dealership would have been a better buy | at least then I would have no vibration worries
 "words": We traded a Toyota Tundra double cab for the Odyssey | I was very hesitant to trade my pick-up for a more family friendly vehicle but I couldn't be happier | Our highway mileage has been a bit dissapointing but we do push the speed limit and have been around 21 mpg on the highway | Our first tank of gas was the dealer tank and went about 17 mpg | The room is amazing | All the amenities are smartly done | The RES is an excellent option | With an adaptor my son's video ipod can hook up in the back to watch videos he has on the ipod | The PS2 is also a fixture in the rear of the vehicle | The drive is excellent and the quality is outstanding | I would highly recommend this vehicle for a family | 
 "words": I love this car | I have been driving sports sedans and SUVs up to this point and this is my first minivan | We bought it and immediately took a 9 hr | trip up to Lake Tahoe with the kids and all the gear | This thing has a ton of room | It is very comfortable and actually fun to drive | Drives very much like a car | The engine is great with a lot of pick up for it | s size and engine type | Read the reviews here at Edmunds and sites like Motor Trend and you will see that this is the best in the class | Some people are complaining about gas mileage being less than stated | that is true for every car including and especially hybrids | Just keep in mind that the numbers they give are their best | 
 "words": Driver seat is for dwarves arm rest is for people with 20 waist the navigation is a joke | If you do not know where you are this thing will not tell you as it has very low resolution and streets are not seen on the display just a grid of lines nobody knows what streets they are | Icons only appear at 1 8 and 1 20 better take a look your self trough the windshield you do not need the GPS when you can see it trough the window | Voice activated | turn on radio and the system will turn off the A C | All orders are confused seems only speaks Japanese | Air conditioner is to be used in the North Pole or so not in Miami or the tropics does not cools enough in resume no worth the money | 
 "words": We priced and looked at all minivans | Owned a Dodge which was fare | Could have bought others for less | But we are extremely happy with our decision | Everything about our Honda is great | Could never go back to something else even with the more money we spent | 
 "words": The 2007 Odyssey with the variable cylinder engine sacrifices city mpg for hwy mpg | As we use our vehicle predominately for city driving the average mileage of 14 mpg is significantly worse than our 2003 Odyssey average of 19 mpg | If we had known we wouldn't have bought the vehicle | Sorry in CT with 2 1 2 years to go | 
 "words": Sienna was close but was priced higher for similar features | Quest high price plus shape appears to be done by bubble blowing machine | Caravan looks uglier with each new generation and resale value should equal price of a decent TV in a few years | My Odyssy is pretty good inside and out engine is very quiet ride is smooth and overall structure is very tight | Combine that with a roomy interior easy access to 3rd row and a decent list of standard features | Lastly since it is a Honda you'll know that resale value will fare better than others I should know I traded in my old Caravan | Lastly with end of model year you should be able to get pretty close to invoice price |

 "words": We bought our Honda after looking at the top three rated this year Toyota Honda Kia | The Toyota didn't have as much bang for the buck as the Honda not as many creature comforts | The Kia has terrible depreciation so would have to have a big-time Gap Insurance and is cheap looking | The Odyssey has been great | We've taken it to 3 dogs shows tons of room for crates grooming supplies luggage with room to spare | Comfortable ride and GREAT mileage | It gets much better mileage than my little Malibuand there's hardly any road noise | We've owned the big Dodge custom vans a Ford Aerostar etc | so we're not newcomers to the van market | 
 "words": Quick notes 1 How can this car be without day time running lights | 2 Some of the interior feels cheap | 3 The passenger side armrest is an ergonomically AWFUL and skeletally unfriendly design you will need muscle relaxers on a long ride | 4 This car guzzles gas | Driving just a mere 14 miles cost me a quater of a tank | You can practically see the fuel gauge move | 5 The second row middle seat is a poor design and the storage entry below seems not thoughtfully designed | The hand sized opening is ridiculous in view of the cavernous storage area | You cannot possibly reach items that are not within a few inches from the opening but there is no way to keep items close to the opening | 
 "words": Really no other minivan has the same well balanced list of virtues | Easily the best handling minivan we test drove | Interior is well appointed with excellent build quality | The cabin abounds with thoughtful touches such as the cabin view mirror built into the sunglass holder allowing you to keep an eye on everyone in back without having to turn around | The engine is flawless true to Honda's reputation | We went with the EX to get the standard 8th seat and dual power sliding doors | Unless you are looking for an ultra cheap stripped down minivan the Odyssey is the only minivan you need to consider | 
 "words": Very pleased with the seating and leg comfort | It is important to have good seats and leg room in the second and third rows which Honda offers over the other two competitors | Having driven Lincolns for years comfort was 1 priority and the Honda Touring gives you all and more | Gas mileage has been in the range of 20 22 town hwy and 25 26 hwy on recent 4000 mile trip | Use of cruise control does give better mileage | I am impressed with the mileage as this van is 235lbs heavier than a Lincoln TC | 
 "words": I have put approximately 10000 miles on the van since I purchased it | It has a smooth ride and more than adequate power | The DVD and nav systems have been great | I have noticed that gas mileage is not as advertised 3-5 mpg less than on sticker | Also as time goes by the driver's seat has become a problem | As I come to a stop slow or fast the seat slightly shifts forward with an audible click | As I hit the gas slow or fast it shifts slightly back and clicks again | Dealership serviceperson states that he felt the shift and click but tested another van in the lot and it did the same thing so it must be normal | What | 
 "words": Just received the EX-L on July 2nd | First gas mileage was 19 MPG mixed | The first highway MPG was 28 | 8 | Air temp 70F speed 62-66 mph small rolling hills with a light load | Starts and stops can be much smoother than with my 2000 Subaru Outback 220000 miles | The all-windows-down when unlocking and many safety features are great | For example if the sliding door window is down the door will only open 75 | I plan on the van lasting 250000 miles | 
 "words": We have 4 children and needed a family vehicle to replace the Expedition which is not family friendly | The Odyssey is perfect for our needs | We have 2 children in car seats and the two captains chairs in the 2nd row make it easy to get the kids in and out of while the two older ones can easily get to the 3rd row not so in the Expedition | Traveling is great | It's quiet and the remote for the DVD makes watching movies a breeze | I love the remote sliding doors | I'm pretty satisfied with gas mileage averaging out at 22 mpg | 
 "words": We took delivery of our 07 Odyssey only to be greeted by a dead battery the next day | The battery was found to be defective and the battery was replaced | The van is currently back at the dealership for replacement of the rear brake discs with 300 miles on the vehicle | THe service advisor defined this situation as lot rot | I will presume that these are just issues that need to be worked out with delivery but so far this is the least reliable initial quality for any vegicle I have ever experienced | This is our first Honda but we have previously purchased new 3 Fords 1 Saturn 1 Chevrolet and 1 Saab and have never had any delivery issues like we have experienced with this vehicle | 
 "words": Great fuel economy 20 mpg | Great ride only some road noise due to choice of Bridgestone tires | Great finish and paint | Great handling and braking | Great acceleration and power | Great interior | Great safety ratings | Great value for money | Great resale value maintained in future | Great reliability 
 "words": We bought the van due to our growing family | Everything is what we expect in a Honda other than MPG on sticker says 18 25 MPG | We get 16 22 MPG | We do not drive fast and we are not heavy people | Other then this the van is just fine | 
 "words": With 2 kids and their grandparents' visiting about every 3 months we needed a versatile comfortable safe and reliable vehicle | A crossover was not an option since we needed a vehicle that allowed us to walk not contort crawl to the back and take care of a newborn | Test drove the Odyssey Sienna Quest and Entourage | Sienna-drive too trucklike and more expensive for same amenities | Hyundai drove well but interior looked and felt cheap | Quest was not well builtexpensive | Just bought this so no report on the MPG but the overall report thus far is great | Smooth quiet car-like ride | Lots of room for storage and kids | Thoroughly tested everything in it B4 buying and all works great | 
 "words": My new 2007 Honda Odyssey drives and performs relatively well but there were two key areas where I am simply not satisfied | My biggest disappointment is in the Odyssey's horrible gas mileage far less that what is quoted by Honda | I only get 15 mpg in city | At over 3 per gallon this is outrageous | I can almost see the fuel gauge dropping as I'm driving down the road | In addition Honda Co | decided to save money at the consumer's expense by no longer including basic items like cargo netting middle row compartment lazy Susan etc | in their 2007 models as they have in previous years | It was a let down to find this out after purchasing the vehicle | 
 "words": The van itself is really good | However the PAX tires are HORRIBLE | Paid extra to get the touring edition after 29000 miles tires were worn out | Had to wait over a week to get new tires in cost over 200 per tire to replace | Brushed one up against a curb and the part of the brand new tire peeled off | Honda would not replace it | I feel like I was ripped off by the PAX tire and by Honda's lack of willingness to take responsibility for the problem | The tires wear out quickly and are difficult to get replaced in a timely manner | This is the only tire available for the touring edition | 
 "words": My 2007 Honda Odyssey with 8000 miles started taking my sleep away | Within a month of buying this van transmission of sound from DVD system to wireless earphones failed for which internal wiring had to be replaced and rewired | Within a week from this incident DVD system started malfunctioning and it was replaced | Soon after this the CD radio was replaced to cure a fault | Next was a passenger seat in the middle row which was jamming | it was replaced too | Front wipers were waiting to break next | My van is with the dealer now to fix them | I wonder if anything in the van will remain as a factory installed equipment at the end of three-year 36000 miles warranty | 
 "words": Pros It's a Honda well built well designed | Mileage is a blend of city and highway and averages 19 | 2 over life of vehicle | Tons of cargo space | Decent versatility with seating cargo arrangements | Cons One delivery defect deep scratch on dashboard | Unlocking rear side doors is very confusing | Exterior green paint looks like they forgot to add enough green pigment | Option packages too pricey | 
 "words": Recently traded in my old mazda minivan for the new EX-L model | Love this car so far | Much better than Mazda MPV | Very stable fun to drive | Feel much safer with 10 airbags installed | The rear entertainment is a must-have | Playing the movie keeps all my kids quiet even in a long drive | The sliding door however did not function well | It won't latch completely | Went to the dealer three times to fix it | Make sure check all your features and fix them right away | Overall very happy with this purchase | 
 "words": Absolutely terrific family vehicle especially with 2 young boys who are only growing | We finally took it on a longer trip this past weekend with the grandparents as well and all 6 of us were very comfortable during the trip | Hard to beat the value when compared to other mini vans and some SUVs | We compared it to our friend's LX470 which is 2x as expensive | Only things that vehicle had on our Odyssey 4 wheel drive the DVD system and silly wood grain accents | 
 "words": Purchased on a Wednesday took on a road trip Friday 750 miles round trip | Overall very comfortable ride and QUIET | Wind and road noise were minimal compared to our 99 Grand Caravan | Tons of luggage room fit family of four luggage and dog comfortably | On its maiden voyage we achieved 26 | 5mpg on average round trip | Used cruise control kept speed at or below 70 | Kids love the back seats compared to the Dodge stow and go which were very uncomfortable | In-floor storage is cavernous tons of cup holders easy access to back seat | Seating for 8 but don't do more than 7 | The 3 | 5L V-6 has tons of pickup | Very impressed with accelleration | 
 "words": 2nd Odyssey replacing one purchased in 2000 | Honda fixed my previous complaints with the '00 including having a 5 speed leather heated seats is much quieter moonroof and a exterior temperature display | The folding rear seat is improved with headrests that don't come off and the whole thing collapses easier | Spare tire relocated to the back cabin making room for extra storage in the second row floor | HWY mileage improved tp 27 MPG with variable cylinder shutoff despite the engine horsepower now at 255 from 210 in '00 | All that said what I like most about the Odyssey is its car like ride | It simply drives wonderful with hardly any body roll | Drive a GM van and you'll understand | 
 "words": I was finally able to convince my wife to upgrade our '03 4Runner with an '07 Sienna LE-8 Pkg 4 for the added convenience space and comfort | But before heading to the Toyota dealer we thought to give the Pilot and Odyssey a final look | We ultimately left the Honda dealer a couple hours later in an Ody EX-L w RES NAV because of the trim level's standard features and equipment | Aside from the significant gap between actual fuel economy we have experienced over 2K of mixed city hwy driving versus | EPA ratings our other main issue is that access to the 3rd row requires folding or completely removing the PlusOne seat in the 2nd row when our girls' carseats are installed on the outer seats | 
 "words": Horrible gas mileage | noise rattle in door panels from speakers even when radio volume and bass is low | Transmission shifts very hard |

 "words": This '07 Ody Touring is a great upgrade over our '01 Ody EX in design performance and ride quality | The Ody Touring is the best package by far | The Touring has better ride quality better comfort and less noise than the EX-L | So far we drove about 900 miles in a little over one month | Mileage is only 17-18 mpg for 50-50 local and highway with A C on and some waiting at the takeout lines | Considering the weight of the van it's acceptable | Parking sensors and a TPMS that tells you the actual tire pressures are great additions | 
 "words": The Black touring van rides great | Previous car was Cadillac CTS-V | I love the size of the DVD and Nav screens | Easy to enter with the automatic doors and lift gate | Not getting more than 20 mpg with 10000 miles on it |

 "words": We purchased the van at the end of December and have put a little over 3000 miles on it | I had a 2005 Toyota Sienna which I traded in that was probably the most annoying car I've ever owned with its transmission problems and clunks clanks squeaks groans etc | So far the van has done very well with the following exceptions 1 | It has a chirping scraping hissing noise that isn't real loud but it is annoying especially at 30 mph and 1500 RPM-louder when you first start out | 2 | Gas mileage is poor-17 combined city and highway and 19 on the highway | 3 | It misses when idling and jumps a bit when the AC compressor goes on off |

 "words": Shortly after purchasing our Odyssey we loaded 4 adults two kids two large boxes into the van for a trip to the park | Not only were we all comfortable but we could have easily fit another 2 adults | The ride is smooth and the van corners like a coupe | 
 "words": This van drives like a dream | Everything is great from the quality of the paint to the quality of the cloth interior | We looked at Nissan Toyota Hyundai Ford and Dodge didn't even consider GM It was down to Toyota and Honda and we chose the Odyssey because it was the most bang for the buck | 
 "words": This is a disappointment after owning a 2001 | Fit finish are not as good | Cabin noise is only slightly improved | Fuel Economy with the variable displacement has been about 16 mpg around town | Max mpg of 20 on a 200 miles trip | 
 "words": We researched the Sienna and this one and finally went for the odyssey because it drove better and looks better overall than the Sienna in my opinion | On the inside they are both pretty competitive and I did not find anything that stood out that was better than the other | The Sienna had all these confusing package options with not all option packages that you like available in all regions | This is a mess | On the contrary Honda has implemented a simpler scheme where you have 4 or 5 basic packages and individual accessories on top on them to choose from | A nice van overall | 
 "words": I've only had my Odyssey for 4 days but already I love it | It's a great drive handles just like a sporty car | Everything is so lush and classy looking | 
 "words": I drove my van off the lot once after the papers were signed | Big mistake | Bad vibration in the steering wheel | Service Director is great but after 7 service visits I'm a little irritated | Oil leak still trying to determine from where | Engine backfired today | The tires and wheels have been replaced once working on the second time | I wish I had better things to say | OH my gas mileage finally improved when I hit 5000 miles I average 19 in the city | I think the steering is a little to sensitive so I seem to oversteer a lot | It does great in the snow | The seats are very comfy | The interior plastic scratches really easy so I tell the kids don't kick it or let the seat belt hit it | 
 "words": Great look ride performance | Former Dodge minivan owner Interior very nice comfortable seats good sound system | Road feel is solid stable | Bought this one in Colorado and immediately drove it to Louisiana | I look forward to a pleasant ownership experience | 
 "words": Bought first of year and have loved it so far | Extremely comfortable for all passengers drives almost like a car and the build material quality makes it feel like a bit more expensive vehicle | We have friends with a 50K Lexus GX470 which is nice but doesn't feel like it's worth twice as expensive as the EX-L | We added our own DVD system so the only thing missing is Navigation | 
 "words": I have put 12000 miles on our 2007 EX- L and so far it's been a very reliable and enjoyable car | The car drives smoother and has better performance than the Sienna | Interior features are well done and laid out | They went cheap on a few interior parts being made of cheap plastic | Overall interior comfort is really nice and it's a great car to take on long road trips | The floor storage is also a nice feature but the the thing that got me to buy the Honda over Toyota was the way the seats folded and set up some much easier than the Toyota | I also notice the steering rack is not as smooth as the Toyota but I just got it replaced and it's much smoother | 
 "words": I was one of those | I'll never own a mini-van | But after having 2 kids and adopting 2 more I had little choice | I eventually got up the nerve to drive it to the bus stop | I got plenty of I told ya so's | from the soccer moms and rightly so | This is an awesome van | I had no idea how convenient these things were | We are VERY impressed with the features ride CONVENIENCE and drive | The seats are comfortable the interior spacious and it looks sharp | The rear entertainment system is a dream come true and I love the stow away 8th seat | This van replaced an '06 double- cab Toyota Tundra which I dearly loved | However the gas mileage I now get sure softens the blow | 
 "words": The MPG is deceiving | It said 20 in city and 28 Freeway | I got overall about 19 to 20 MPG | I hate the DVD player | Intermittently it scratches my DVD | I took it back to the dealer to have it fixed to only have them do nothing | They blame on my DVD | My DVD is just like any DVD | If you can't reliably play my DVD then you can't play 99 | 99 of the DVD's out there | It seems like the player does not hold the DVD snuggly | I had that similary problem with a DVD player at home it keeps scratch my DVD when I got a new player it solved the problem | 
 "words": Great Vehicle drives like a car but you know your in a van | I own the EX with 8 passenger seating | It has lots of power to pass | I live in Buffalo New York area the traction control is great for driving in the snow but learned quickly why you to shut it off if you are stuck in deep snow | Can't wait to take it on a long drive | And if you have little ones like me Car seats are easy in and out and the remote rear sliding doors are helpful | 
 "words": We just traded our 1999 Honda Odyssey and brought the 2007 touring | There are tons of options added in the touring and the ergonomics is perfect on the touring | We resaerched the Sienna but based on the price and features offered on the Touring it was value for the money | 
 "words": I really enjoy this mini van | I have had Dodge and Chrysler previously- after a while problems with engine and electronics | So I decided I would buy either Honda or Toyota | I really enjoy the easy access front seat to back to attend to baby | I like that both doors slide open and the back door window go down as well | It drives very smooth and it gives a family of 5 plenty of room | It has been great when we travel | I do not feel squeezed in | I feel that I have plenty of room | I would recommend this vehicle | The AC and heat work great | I live in Texas so the AC is a BIG deal | The stereo system that came with the model is very good as well | 
 "words": I researched every domestic minivan on the market | By far the Honda was built the best | It has the smoothest ride plus it doesn't feel like I am driving a bus | The Toyota felt cheap and don't get me started on the Chevy | Honda must have gone to great lengths perfecting their van | It's a Ten | 
 "words": My husband talked me into buying a minivan because it would be more economical | Out of all of the minivans we test drove the Honda Odyssey was the best with the Toyota Sienna in a close second | However if you are wanting an economical car with good gas mileage do not buy this van | There is many cool features such as the rear view camera Rear Entertainment Center the fact that you can open and close the doors and hatch | But overall I do not think it is worth the money | Therefore we took it back and are getting the GMC Acadia | Seriously check the Acadia out I think it is the best crossover on the market | 
 "words": We bought this van at the end of January after being torn between this and the Toyota Sienna | I must say that I usually agonize over large purchases and this was no exception | We went with the Honda because we got a great deal and because frankly I've always wanted one because of it's fine reputation | It was probably a bit more than the Sienna but Honda's new car financing rates were better | I feel that the interior reeks of quality and the body style is much more appealing than any of the other vans out there | I was not disappointed and I don't think you will be either | 
 "words": Purchased in early December and took a 2000 mile road trip averaging 23 | 5 mpg on the hwy | Handles extremely well
 "words": Finally went back to Honda van because of good gas mileage for a van rear comft seats that went into well | comfortable other seats leather moonroof great driving ability for van classand great hauling capability for two going-to-be retired coupleplus low platform and again comfort for the aging population | Also excellent design to see outside windows and to park | We had the original vanthen went to a Nissan quest and then to the Villager Estatemercury | We wanted to leave the seats in and have the back like an old fashion 70's station wagon but front comfort of a van | Honda filled the bill again | I have been driving a Honda Accord beginning in the early 90's | Love Honda drive ride interior | 
 "words": We just moved up from a 2000 Odyssey | The difference is absolutely astounding | The 2007 is quieter has more power and is significantly upgraded on the interior | We've only had the 07 for a few weeks so gas mileage etc | has not been really checked yet | My only complaint is with the IPOD Music Link system which is just awful | We were told the Music Link would work through the radio and Nav system this turned out to be a false statement | The only good news is our dealer has agreed to pull the Music Link system out and give us a full refund | 
 "words": This van is a pleasure to own | It drives very nicely | There is plenty of room and the fit and finish is top notch | The engine is very powerful and we have been averaging approx 20 mpg for the first two tanks with a mix of in town and hwy driving | Overall I have no complaints and would purchase an Odyssey again
 "words": Don't be fooled by those people that say the gas mileage is bad | They are probably jealous for buying a Sienna | The gas mileage has been superb for me 23 MPG city and 27 MPG Highway | My van has 12000 miles and has had no issues | Interior is Acura-like and 255 HP engine is very reponsive and smoother than 266 HP Toyota Sienna's engine | I love the Odyssey's styling and its Luxurious feel inside | 
 "words": We Love this Van | Kids have so much room | More comfortable than our previous 01' Dodge Grand Caravan | Don't know about the gas mileage yet but it doesn't seem to be horrible like other reviews suggest | If you live in snowy conditions like we do definitely pay a little extra to get the rubber floor mats and cargo tray | This van has so much get-up for a van that I catch myself speeding often | Love the back windows the cargo storage area the 8th seat the heated seats the moonroof THE RIDE | Test drive everything else and then get this Van | 
 "words": I guess we are actually parents when we sell the Jeep to get a minivan | If you are going to drive a minivan this is the one | The Odyessy handles like a car and travels like a family room | 
 "words": We researched minivans for years before we finally bought one and without a doubt the Odyssey has met all of our expectations except for one | To us it looks the best but it truly shines in all the important areas | Its ride is awesome | Plenty of power and handles like a dream | The fit and finish are impeccable and everything is where you would expect to find it | The leather is fantastic | It is the best vehicle we have ever owned | 
 "words": Researched minivans and did test drives till I was on the verge of a breakdown | With safety and reliability as primary concerns my wife and I could not find a better vehicle to suit the needs of our family of 5 | The ride is superb and the solid road handling manners and minimized road noise are nearly identical to our much pricier 2006 Toyota Sequoia | VCM Variable Cylinder Management is my only knock | Adding cost to get an extra 1 MPG is odd but standard in the EX-L Platform | If you drive a million miles with gas at 5 a gallon perhaps it would pay for itself | maybe | 
 "words": We have owned this van for a month and LOVE it | It's our first minivan but it doesn't feel like one | The whole driving experience is sooo great | We're an average family with two little ones and a teenager and we all enjoy going for rides together |

 "words": After owning several Honda products including a'01 Van there have been a lot of changes in the '07 model Touring | The ride is fantastic and the performance improved a lot | Fit and Trim is tops and inside design has improved a lot but could use a few more minor improvements | 
 "words": Purchased Ody EX on Dec 14th and took a 600 mile trip to Kansas City with the family | There was some pronounced noise on very course pavement but overall much quieter than our 1999 Honda Ody | The overall gas mileage was 22 mpg | not bad with headwinds to and from our destinations | The engine has lots of power during acceleration onto freeways or in town | Cornering is great even on tight turns | Seats are firm but comfortable | Instruments are well positioned | Really like the small light that shines on the tray between the front passenger driver seats as it allows you to see your cell phone or whatever in on the tray without turning on the reading dome lights | Kids love the window shades | 
 "words": This is a excellent riding vehicle with many worthwhile safety features | Although the engine has an ECO mode the overall MPG is only 15 | The lowest mileage has been 12 and the highest is 22 during the three months we have owned this vehicle | Our previously owned 'O4 Sienna got about 5-6 mpg more for the same type of driving | Access to the third row seat was easier in our Toyota Sienna | The PAX run flat tires are nice to have but will cost significantly more to replace that conventional tires | The navigation system is easy and fun to use but frequently comes up withentering unverified area on some of our routes | We liked our Sienna better but this is still an excellent minivan | 
 "words": This is my second Honda Odyssey that I've purchased as a new vehicle from the dealer | After about 30000 miles a problem developed with a noise sounds like an old clunker | It sounds like a transmission or a valve noise on acceleration especially on the highest gear when the car is under even slight load | Honda is stating per Honda Engineer that this is a normal noise even thought Honda dealer already replaced shields transmission torque converter and other parts but they refuse to actually fix it | They have done about 3000 worth of repairs and they refuse to replace a transmission which is probably cause of this noise | I Will Not Buy Honda ever again | 
 "words": I purchased in July 2009 a used 2007 Honda Odyssey with 30k miles on it | After driving for two weeks realized it has vibrations and skipping from the transmission | Will NOT keep a constant speed and vibrates at 40mph | It had no prior warranty claims and clean carfax | Love the van but I have a transmission on order and haven't even made the first payment | Thank God for warranty | If we continue to have problems we will seek help from the dealer to get us out of it | Honda needs to recognize this problem | I am sick to my stomach but thankful for the Certified warranty | it is covered til 100k miles | 
 "words": I have gotten 30 000 miles on the no flat tires by driving longer than I should | 1200 to replace | Car hesitates at 60 65 mph | Dealer says this is normal | Air noise is bad in the car | Brakes have been replaced twice | They finally got it right at my expense | The gas mileage is no better than 14 mpg in town driving | I have owned many Hondas and this is the first one that has been a total bad experience | 
 "words": We really like the Odyssey mini-van but the fuel mileage is absolutely horrible | I agree with many other reviews | I knew we were not getting good fuel mileage and finally checked it on a beach trip | We averaged a very poor 17 | 2 mpg | My parents averaged over 18 mpg in their Chevy Tahoe | Other than fuel mileage being much less than advertised we really like the vehicle | 
 "words": Wonderful van with the exception of the steering issues | Read all the problems with alignment and steering with these vehicles extreme pulling memory steer difficulty aligning steering clucks steering resistance etc | etc | I don't know how this vehicle got such high ratings in all editorials without anyone noticing the irregularities with drive and alignment | Don't buy it | Seems as though some must be OK but more than one would think have issues | believe me and the others when we say this | 
 "words": I would not consider another Honda until they fix the excessive road noise | Too bad because the vehicle is excellent in many ways | On a rough surface noise will prevent normal conversation with rear passengers 
 "words": Don't buy one with PAX tire system | Class action lawsuit against Honda in process | Tires wear out between 20K- 25k | Expensive to replace | Can only be done at authorized location which is usually Honda dealer | No spares | Ours went flat traveling on Sunday and had to stay over until next day when Honda opened | New tire cost 298 because old could not be fixed only 16k miles on it | Hotel cost 100 | Honda said so sad too bad | We are going to get rid of ours even though it is a great van | Don't want to get stranded in middle of nowhere | 
 "words": My Odyssey is built very well no problems through 25000 miles | My complaint about the car though is the fuel mileage it's as bad as a huge SUV | Car gets 14 mpg city 22 mpg highway | Dealer first told me to wait for it to break in now he states it's normal wow | I am shocked and disappointed with the mileage | Beware if you buy this vehicle you'll spend big bucks for fuel | 
 "words": The van is surging or hesitating around 60 m | p | h | so we brought it into the dealer and said that is normal for the van | Said it's the overdrive system and ECO saving gas | I just don't believe that and they also said every new Honda with O D system will do this | Please if anyone else is experiencing this and have actually had it fixed please let me know or tell us what they did to fix the problem | Everything else is great about this van but I don't believe the surging is normal | I just don't think they want to put a new transmission in it | 
 "words": Two issues with my Odyssey | First it shakes when you are slowing down | The dealer stated it was due to tire pressure | Took it in and it still shakes | Second my van was steaming and hissing one day | I took it into the dealer | The service guy did a 15 sec | look over and informed me that it was probably a hole in the condenser caused by a rock | He said they would have to perform a check that would take an hour and that this would not be covered by my warranty as it was not a factory defect | Guess what yep the check revealed that it was a small hole caused by a rock | How he knew that was beyond me | Cost with the check was over 1200 | I found out that many many people have had the same issue | 
 "words": If I had known prior to purchase this vehicle runs rich I would never have purchased | I cannot not afford 13 mpg in the city | And until I hit the magic of 6500 miles on the van that is the best I can expect | It does about 21 on the interstate | I gave up some nice features in my Pontiac Montana for the privilege of paying more in payments insurance and gas | not a good thing | 
 "words": This will be my last Honda or Japanese product | The build quality is terrible on this thing | It rattles and squeaks with only 4000 miles on it | I had to have the whole Nav system replaced | Every bump in the road makes the cd player skip | My other car is a honda too 2004 Accord | It has already had the transmission replaced on it as well as not wanting to run in the wet or cold weather | Japanese quality | Never heard of it | 
 "words": This is a first impression only | but so far the new 07 Honda Odyssey has me very impressed | We just upgraded from a Subaru Forester | The Odyssey gives us lots more space seating flexibility comfort safety and creature comforts | I am dreading to find out what the actual mpg will be but that's a sacrifice you make by getting a van | Initial impressions include solid craftsmanship nice interior design solid pick-up great rear camera feature nice drive | 
 "words": Why did we buy a 07 Odyssey Touring RN well the VALUE of HONDA doesn't decrease like it does with any other van available on the market | SAFETY is the number one reason why you should buy an Odyssey We get decent mileage considering that we drive a 4000lbs tank | We have a 06 Odyssey EXL NR with 33K miles and it drives and rides like it just came out of the showroom | So the 06 will have 150K in another 4 years | We could have gotten a ford product since my dad works for them but they would never hold the value | If they ever come out with a VOLVO Van we may consider it but until such time Its the Odyssey | Yeah it might be a tank but it can do so much for so little | 
 "words": New in 2007 1 Telescopic steering wheelgreat if over 6' 2 Tire Pressure Monitor which alerts the driver if one of the tires experiences loss in air pressure 3 Coin Holder in center dash cup holders | The leather seats are very comfortable and the front captain seats offer electric heating for those in colder climates | The instrument panel is very intuitive the design lighting is the best I have viewed | Odyssey is filled with safety features from the front side curtain airbags along with sliding side doors that will stop if they encounter any resistance | VCM feature shuts down one bank of cylinders when coasting thus increasing fuel economy | I highly recommend the Odyssey
 "words": Honda continues to build a great vehicle with so many features plenty of power and comfort necessary for those long trips | The ride is smooth and quiet but yet there's plenty of power in reserve when you need it | All the leather seats are very comfortable and actually fit an adult over 6' tall a major selling point for me | We didn't purchase the touring because the additional features were not needed and the consensus was that there are still issues with the run-flat tires that need to be worked out | I think the parking sensors should be standard instead I will be purchasing them from Bernardi Parts | This van has the same turning radius of my '95 accord | 
 "words": Only had the Odyssey a couple of weeks but I'm very impressed | The Nav | is Awesome | Haven't had a chance to check the gas mileage out yet | One this extra that the nav | does that the book won't tell you is you can pull up Religious Organizations | Under Places go to Advanced and put in Religous Organization | We have a small Church and it was even listed | That's good for Church goers | 
 "words": This is our second Odyssey | We cannot believe the difference in refinement and performance over the '99 which we thought was a very good vehicle | Great drivetrain smooth powerful engine drive by wire throttle is very responsive excellent shifts | The audio system is not great but if you want to spend a bit more money upgrade with aftermarket stuff | Very cool NAV system voice activated | XM radio was a nice touch | The interior is very well laid out high quality | Would have been nice to have a 110volt outlet but we'll make do | Also I prefer the cruise control on my '97 M3 why do you need 4-5 buttons to control it when one stalk will do | Great job Honda | 
 "words": Great minivan | The RES is A | We have a Dodge Grand Caravan as well and this vehicle is far superior | Test drove a pilot as well | This Van was more flexible for getting people in and out of it than the pilot | The leather interior is very nice and the heated seats are great | The car has a very tight turning radius compared to our Dodge | The interior controls are laid out nicely | The steering wheel radio controls are a bonus | Opted not to get the touring model because of the required run-flat tires | Costly to replace Did not have a need for the navi so I opted not to get it | Me and my wife now fight to drive this vehicle | The stereo system is weak and the speakers are lame | 
 "words": this is the best van i have ever owned | i had a mazda and this honda is ten times better it is quieter smoother more powerful better made and fun to drive I have five kids and they love it and fit very comfortably
 "words": My wife and I drove several different vans and had it narrowed down to the Sienna XLE and the Odyssey EX-L | I decided that I wanted to drive the Odyssey Touring to see if there was much of a difference | I couldn't believe how much nicer of a drive the Touring model was | I love it | There are a ton of features that are all useful | This is one nice van | 
 "words": I am single still for a little bit longer and have no kids but have a lot of friends | I drive an 96 accord sedan with 216k miles and still running strong well it only sit 4 comfortably and when we ALL go out we always end up driving several cars Well with this new van We can pile them in no problem | 
 "words": It took me over a year to finally convince myself to buy a minivan instead of my usual SUVs | But when comparing gas mileage type of gas price and all options I wanted the Odyssey came out on top every time | With 2 kids the auto doors auto rear hatch have made my life so much easier | Navigation is tops very smooth ride more interior room than my Suburban and my husband enjoys playing with the navigation center while I drive | A all the way |

 "words": Car rides smooth | Plenty of power for a minivan | Handles well | Honda navigation is great but voice activation is not very good | Great car | The storage is great and there is plenty of room for everything | 
 "words": Just bought the new Touring model after owning a 2003 Odyssey | Loved the 2003 but this one is amazing | Too many features and all are great | Navigation system is too good to be true more room and I still feel like I'm driving my Accord | Thought about the Sienna for a day or two due to the AWD but made the right choice with nthe Honda | 
 "words": I love the honda mini van because of it's comfort | My mom's car is much more bulky and hard to view things she has an old toyota sienna Lastly I got my odyssey a little while ago and have had no problems at ALL

 "words": The Touring model is vastly different in ride handling and drivability than EX | Took home an EX-L w dvd on Saturday and the van had a shimmy in it and front end groaned on slight bumps | The tires were noisy and the radio was the pits | Not too hot for 35K | Back to the dealership on Monday and drove the Touring light years ahead | Was able to upgrade for more money and am very happy execpt for the so-so speakers | It drives as well as my S420 Mercedes | If you can afford the Touring drive it last and you'll take one home | Don't be fooled by the run flat sticker shock | 190 if you have to buy one from the dealer | Michelin will warrant them for 2 years no cost if 50 tread left | 
 "words": We bought a 2007 Odyssey EX-L during Honda's annual clearance event in October 2007 and saved about 4K on MSRP | The EX-L has the VCM variable cylinder management feature that shuts off up to 3 cylinders when not needed | It is very unnoticeable to all but the most expert drivers and adds up to an average fuel economy over 25 mpg with every tank of gas for our family | We added an Alpine Overhead DVD system for the kids and saved another 1K versus getting the EX-L with factory DVD besides the Alpine has a bigger screen mommy controls and game playing features that the factory DVD does not have | We added luggage racks and use our Thule Roof Box for cross country trips for added comfort | 
 "words": My car has 19000 miles on it and I noticed a hesitation when RPMs are around 1500 | I could hear it in the engine noise as well | I brought it in to dealer tech figured it out right away | Said he'd seen several of these | He ordered the part will drop the transmission and fix it | Or so I hope | I'll soon find out | Everything else about the Odyssey is great | Though I do wish the Touring model came with a third seat in the middle | It is so great to be able to open the doors in bad weather as I'm approaching the car just plop my smalls and groceries without getting soaked | 
 "words": Honda failed to compensate for the added weight of the pax tires and the results are continual steering wheel vibration longer braking distance tire balancing issues road noise and a poor overall driving experience | 
 "words": I did not have any transmission problems until I had my Odyssey for about a year | I have had it into the dealer three times and they tell me that there is not a problem | Apparently they hook it up to a computer and it tells them there is not a problem so no problem exists in their mind | My vehicle chronically searches for a gear at low speeds | It also has a shake to it when trying to maintain a lower speed | The dealer looks at me like I'm crazy but I have 2 other friends with Odysseys and the same complaints | I wish Honda would stand behind their product before their reputation is ruined for good | This is SO disappointing | We traded in our Toyota van for Honda and wish we hadn't | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle for the many features my Honda model offers such as storage capability number and placement of cup holders GPS Navigation system DVD player and the list goes on | One feature I thought I was going to appreciate was the run flat tires on this model | I was wrong thinking that | I have had three flat tires in 18 months with two repairs costing about 125 with the third requiring replacement of the tire | That bill was about a car payment in value | Lucky for me I had purchased the extended road hazard insurance for the tires | It takes the dealer about 4-5 hours to repair the tire purely outrageous | 
 "words": Have owned several Honda vehicles | Top of the line always satisfied | There's a resonant vibration problem inherent to the Odyssey vans based on blogs I have checked since the dealer has not been able to resolve the issue | I have bought new tires balanced etc | Check websites for honday Odyssey vibration problem before you buy | 
 "words": After owning many vehicles I decided to take the Minivan plunge | Thought I was going with the best after all my research | Odyssey has been in shop four times for transmission problems | Seems to surge at specific times and speeds | Dealer has said this is normal but it is to the point it is so noticeable I can't drive this vehicle | Other than this issue we have not had any other problems | Road noise is an issue but it is a good family car | So much for the Honda Quality | 
 "words": The only knock I can give this fine vehicle is the road noise | This probably from the tires | No problems except a broken A C radiator which was hit by rock kicked up on the freeway | The dealer fixed at no charge even though it was not a equipment failure | I don't know how much VCO helps mileage but it must since it is active even while cruising at 70 mph | 
 "words": While this is often rated the best minivan I have found some critiques that are real | First the pulley on the crankshaft cracked at 22k miles | We also have been having funny shifting patterns at 1500rpm and 35-45mph that the dealer claims is 'normal' 'Grade-Logic' nevertheless it sure is not smooth despite 2 attempts for them to evaluate | Too bad since I waited to buy this 2007 model when Honda secretly changed the transmission without telling customers since the older one was failing also | The ride is noisier on the highway than we hoped | Wish mileage was better than the 17-18 we average | It's big and you can feel it twist and hear rattles in the doors over bumps | I expected more | 
 "words": I raised my two babies in a Caddy DeVille | At ages 5 and 8 it was time to trade into a minivan | Uggg | After months of research Honda kept coming up on top | My mom has a 2002 with 155k miles and still drives like new | So decision made | It is no where near as comfy as the Caddy | But I cannot compare it to a Caddy because well that wouldn't be fair | The van drives tight | It has good acceleration when asked | The interior has so far been kid-proof | The automatic side doors are a must for kids | No worries of them flinging a door open into other cars when parked | I put almost 20k miles per year on it | It is doing well and I hope to run it for many more years and still profit 
 "words": We've owned our Odyssey for about 1 year and have put about 15K miles on it without any issues | We kept our 2001 Mazda MPV and I use it as a work vehicle | There is no comparison between the two how we survived for 6 years in the MPV is unknown | There is now way we could go back | The Odyssey is stylish and a joy to ride in | It's bit clumsy to drive at times but for a vehicle of this size and weight its no bad | I'm amazed at the complaints about gas mileage | How anyone could get 12-13 MPG on the highway must something mechanically incorrect that needs to be evaluated | We have experienced MPG as high as 27 | 5 on the highway and as low as 16 in the city | 21 overall and I track every tank
 "words": Have had my van over 2 years and I love it | On interstate trips I have gotten 30 mpg I was impressed | Around town I get almost 20 mpg | And I tell you I live in a hilly part of western PA This is the most comfy vehicle I have ever driven and my friends have no complaints with the RES | So far everything has worked fine | I've only had it to the garage for oil changes and routine maintenance | Perhaps those complaining of the poor gas mileage on trips going 70-75 mph should obey the speed limit a little more closely | 
 "words": Researched and researched minivans | I flip flopped between this the Sienna and the Kia | I only considered Kia b c of editors' reviews but it wound up being the same price as the Honda | No way on that choice | I opted for Honda b c I got a great deal from the dealer | I couldn't love this car more | I plan on keeping it for quite a while | It's just such a pleasure to have | So far servicing is very reasonable compared to out Volvo | and the car continues to drive smoothly | 
 "words": Prior Toyota Sienna owner | Sienna was good but like the Honda better due to the handling ease space utilization | A lot of whining about the fuel consumption | We get just about what EPA states | If you want fuel economy buy a Honda Civic or Fit | You cannot expect great fuel economy in a 4500 LB vehicle | 
 "words": We are new to the mini van world coming from the large suv gas guzzling world | After 3 months of research and 6 months of ownership we are very glad of our purchase of the Honda Odyssey | This is truly the vehicle that honestly is the best way to travel with children from ages 7 to 11 | The RES is a savior on the highway and the Navi is an argument saver between me and the wife | Fuel mileage is a best of 27 | 6 on hwy and 19 | 8 in town | I was hesitant on the PAX tires but a local retailer will sell them for 160 tire | whew Recently went on a Vegas Vacation to see the in-laws and loved the trip because of this van | 
 "words": I have read some of the reviews | one side more outlets however my Touring edition has four I don't understand complaining about more outlets if Honda already offers a model with more | As far gas mileage I get about 22 on the highway not the 13-15 people state here | Of course I am careful to keep the ECO light on | I like the versatility the Odyssey offers and it is a great vehicle for the family especially with my little boy and getting his car seat in and out and hauling the sttoller | Plus I like the roof rack on the touring so I could mount my roof box and haul some additional stuff | 
 "words": We bought our Odyssey primarily for long road trips | It's been fantastic | Plenty for room for everyone no one complains about being cramped anymore | It's so comfortable inside that long drives are much less fatiguing | The main reason I picked the Honda is because of its great handling | It's seriously better than most SUVs and even some cars | There have been a lot of comments about the fuel economy | The vehicle is heavy so its city mileage is poor | But on the highway with 6 people 4 bikes on a hitch rack I get 22 to 25 mpg on the highway | Better than my 4 door sedan with bikes on the roof | In summary I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a minivan especially if you like to drive | 
 "words": I read several of the previous reviews and had to comment | I am surprised at how many Odyssey owners are so disappointed | I guess we are lucky | I think its perfect | The fuel economy is never going to be what the sticker says on any vehicle | We all bought the van because we had to haul multiple people | The more you haul the heavier the van and the lower your fuel economy | Improve your driving habits properly inflate your tires etc | and you'll get better fuel economy | It drives smooth handles well strong engine good looks luxurious and storage is great | I've driven Sienna Grand Caravan Uplander Freestar Sedona SUVs in the last two years | Hands down winner is Odyssey | 
 "words": I put on 2000 miles a month | I get about 20 mpg in town and 23-25 on the highway at 60-65 | At 70-75 on the interstate it's about 22 mpg | Nothing to complain about there | The car is more comfortable than the Grand Caravans I've owned or than my son's 08 Sienna | The feel on the road is much better than the Sienna for me as a driver or passenger | I'll get about 35K on the PAX tires and then I'll dump them and the rims | WheelMax has the replacements and various Honda dealers online have the tire pressure sensors at 35 apiece | The whole switch will cost what new PAX tires would and then anyone can repair replace a blowout | 
 "words": This is my first minivan and I love it | It is also my first new car | I did a lot of research before I decided on this car wanted 8 passenger and roll down windows | I have been across the country and back yet in the last year i have also had 2 power steering pumps replaced an O2 sensor and now its in for an odd noise around 40 mph | They have no idea what it is | I still love the inside features | Could use more outlets and compartments | But I think it still beats the Toyota out on interior feature | 
 "words": I just traded my 07 van | The in town economy is 16 mpg | The road noise was more than my 02 same van | Highway economy great 26 mpg the van had 6500 miles when traded | Both bought new | Window sticker said 19 mpg in town
 "words": I have mixed feelings about my Odyssey | I love the convenient features but I have had a few problems | We had vibrations noise from the driver's side front area | After a second trip to the dealer it seems to be fixed | The steering column needed to be lubricated | I guess there is a bulletin out about this problem | Also I had to have my rear bumper repainted because paint was peeling off | I had my front grill replaced due to a paint bubble | I hope this turns out to be a reliable vehicle after all these problems are worked out because I didn't expect this when purchasing a Honda at this price | 
 "words": We love our Odyssey | It very comfortable sportier to drive than you'd think and we expect it to last a long time | The third seat has proven comfortable for adults on a 1 | 5 hour ride | What it doesn't do so well is haul cargo | The cargo floor is not perfectly flat or smooth | This seems to be a trade off for the easy to fold third row parts of the hinges stick up | It's impossible to slide things in and out and if you have to crawl in and get something you are sure to scream when you land a knee on one of the hard plastic hinges | Likewise there is a lot of exposed hardware in the floor around the middle row than can get knees toes and fingers | 
 "words": I have seen many suggestions of a class action lawsuit in reviews regarding Honda's claim of MPG and the actual MPG that consumers have noted | I too am extremely disappointed that Honda claimed 26 MPG on the road for this vehicle | I am lucky to get 12 13 on the highway | Also the shift is not smooth nor is the ride comfortable on a long trip | The lift gate is incredibly difficult to manage | I am constantly asking for assistance in the grocery store parking lot | No excuse for a door to be that difficult to lower especially since an automatic was not an option on this model | I was so pleased with my Toyota Sienna and definitely went downhill with this purchase | 
 "words": Three of the seat belts have a nick on the edge of the belt | I can tear the belt material with my hands at the nick | I understand these belts are design for tension force but should any belt develop a nick I sure the tensile force would be reduced | Honda quoted 385 to replace belt | 
 "words": My wife and I purchased a new 2007 Honda Odyssey | It has been in the shop several times | Recently after having service completed for a defective steering pump my wife lost control of her van when the steering wheel locked up | The van was towed and the service department claimed they accidentally replaced the defected steering pump with a defected steering pump | All that said be careful buying a Honda Odyssey the so- called Honda Quality is not all that it's worth | Please Be Careful | 
 "words": Can't complain about the build or interior | Very poor gas mileage at 12- 13 MPG city | Been trying to drive like Grandma to see if it improves but even then it barely makes 15 MPG | And yes I'm on my 3rd oil change so it's broken in | It's a minivan so didn't expect 30 MPG but it's no where near what the sticker promised | The transmission is real chunky shifts are not smooth and doesn't handle hills well which doesn't help the MPG | And handling isn't at all car-like more like a truck | In this era of 4-5 gas the Odyssey just doesn't make sense I would have been better off with a Sienna or a Caravan | I am really ticked off that Honda lied about the MPG first and last Honda I buy | 
 "words": I called myself researching extensively prior to purchase and overall I am pleased with many aspects of my Odyssey | the things I am most unhappy with seem trivial but I find annoying | My 1998 Explorer had more features than my 2007 EXL | Cannot charge my phone with ignition turned off | the radio is horrible and believe me I am not one to complain about radio sounds but this is very bad | The lights do not come on or off automatically | No MP3 or bluetooth I just assumed most of these features would be present- purchasing the next to top of the line would have bought the touring except did not have option on tires | the bumper is scratched i see this with most I see on the road | 
 "words": My wife and I think the Honda Odyssey is the nicest car we have ever owned and plan on buying another one in a year or two | The only complaints we have are the difficulty of strapping oneself in with the seat belts as it seems to be too tight of a fit and we wish the second row seats folded into the floor as they do on the Dodge Caravan and other minivans | Minor complaints on an otherwise excellent car | It's extremely quiet and comfortable to drive on the open highway | We love the rear view mirror and Navigational Aid which we use often | It has good get up and go when you need it | An overall excellent choice if you like minivans | 
 "words": My Odyssey drives well The driver seat is good and supports the driver's back Driving a Toyota Sienna for few hours every day caused me back pain the Odyssey is much better | Gas mileage is poor 17 mixed city hwy 40 60 and 18 | 5 hwy | with or without Air 70 mph Driver only | My other vehicle is SUV with 4 | 5L engine much heavier with 340 Hp does 14 city and 19 Hwy | Sales sticker 19 26 | Honda dealer found that the Gas mileage is within spec | Another problem is the paint that peals of the bumpers | My 2004 Odyssey had a similar 3 | 5L Engine but gas mileage was 20 city hwy
 "words": We bought Odyssey after driving a 2001 Caravan to 138K miles | The Caravan rode better than the Odyssey and got better mileage | Sorry but it's true | We've taken a couple of long road trips 3000 miles and the Ody does well but it does seem louder than it should be and the mileage is very poor | The 3 cylinder fuel saving pitch is a joke | Why can't it beat my 2001 Caravan in MPG | I'm very disappointed in the mileage | My wife an I are Realtors in our 40s and she wanted navigation because the map books are becoming harder to read when getting around | We do like the navigation but it seems to be 2 or 3 years behind in the streets included | Most newer neighborhoods are not in the GPS | 
 "words": The Odyssey is a great van but Honda has misrepresented its fuel economy | The window sticker indicated the van would average 19 city and 26 hwy for mpg | After 10000 miles the best I've seen is 22 mpg on the hwy and my average fuel economy has been 17 to 18 mpg | I anticipated my average fuel economy would be 22 | 5 mpg when purchasing the van | The reduction to 18 will cost me 5700 if I drive it for 150000 miles at 4 | 00 a gallon | Can I suggest class action law suit | 
 "words": We've had our '07 Honda Odyssey EXL-RES for about 6 months | Like everyone else says the MPG is horrible | In the third month dealer had to replace the fuse box because the wipers would only work on high brights would not work and car alarm would not arm major annoyances | The exterior and interior of the van are nice | The shifting is VERY uneven and like another poster said is very pronounced when coasting | I never thought I would miss my Grand Caravan but I do | 
 "words": The main reason I came here is to say that I was able to avoid a head on collision and the Odyssey took it all in stride | An approaching car doing about 40 crossed into our lane as we were doing 40 driver was texting | Two adults a child and an infant were on board the Ody | With a palm on the horn I swerve HARD right towards the curbing and then swerved HARD left to avoid the woods | The oncoming car missed the front left by inches and the van actually DRIFTED cleanly around the nose of the oncoming car as it passed within inches to our left flank | The van was totally composed with no roll tendency and the drift was corrected by the stability system | 
 "words": Very very disappointed with the gas mileage | City is 15-16 | haven't done much highway but it was 18 once | As I approach 3rd gear around 38-40 mph there is a surge forward with the van even if I don't have my foot on the gas at the time | Asked service person and he said that unless the red light comes on the dashboard they can't diagnose it | I wish I could trade it in but I need the room for carpool for my grandchildren | My husband has had 5 Accords but this is my first and last Honda | Bring back my Toyota 4-Runner | 
 "words": I hit a deer on the right front side on the interstate doing 70 mph | It hardly felt like I hit anything | The kids were to busy watching the dvd in back to notice | It's a credit to how the van was designed | The front bumper hood right headlight and right passenger door had to be replaced with a pull to the unibody frame by the headlight | 9k bill to the insurance company | 
 "words": We are a older couple no kids | It's great to get in and out of | Handing is outstanding | Lots of power-wish gas was cheaper so I could use it | At 5500 miles our gas mileage is 26-28 hwy only at 70 mph | We don't drive in city very much we use a scooter for that | Only problem so far has been soft brakes twice to dealer ok now | Had a olds sil | Before Honda was a great upgrade | Ride is smooth quiet and controlled | Best looking minivan inside and out | Great dash lots of nooks and crannies for storage | Seats in 1st and 2nd row are very comfortable haven't tried 3rd row yet | 
 "words": This is a great minivan | I don't know why all these people are complaining about gas mileage | I usually get 20 MPG | 
 "words": This van has too many design flaws when I compare it to my 8 year old Dodge Caravan which I traded in | I could tolerate design flaws but I cannot tolerate transmission bumps when shifting up and down shifting | The dealer's expert mechanic says that this is how all Honda minivans shift | Not comfortable to feel sudden bumps when going from 60 to 70 mph | Many Honda user forums also complain about this bump | The engine also makes a lot of noise when driven between 40-60 mph | The dealer again says that this is how it is | Unacceptable | The bumps and noise make driving experience horrible | 
 "words": This van turned out to be very noisy and hard riding | On the test drive the car performed well had a good ride and didn't seem noisy | After arriving at home I checked the tires as is my practice and found that the tires wee inflated at 28 psi although the door sticker says 36 is the recommended pressure | Think the dealer did this on purpose | I keep 32 psi in my tires | We took a 2000 mile trip right after the purchase and found the road and tire noise to be very bad and the rough ride made the trip very unpleasant | Gas mileage is 16-18 | My 99 Chrysler TC got better mileage and had a far more comfortable ride | It's a good looking vehicle but not the superior all-round on that I expected | 
 "words": We have NEVER been so dissatisfied with this purchase | Traded a 2002 Sienna w 60K that had better gas mileage and was TROUBLE FREE | Tried trading this unit back in to two different Honda dealers now with 8K | BOTH will only offer 4K BELOW TRADE | Must be because of the maintenance history | Engine throttle appears low was reprogrammed still the same | Windows fog on wet days takes forever to defog | Headliner coming apart at windshield | Sunglass holder broke | Stone dead battery at only 5K | Have had SEVERAL electrical issues shorted out headlamp switch and relays | Sometimes doors don't unlock | We wish we still had our old Toyota | What a mistake buying this van | 
 "words": Purchased this vehicle to replace horrible Dodge Caravan | Very happy with Honda except for the use of very cheep interior plastics and poor fuel economy | 12-15 city 17-20 hwy | The plastic around the glove box cup holders and floor boards have many scratches and look worn | 
 "words": We have bought only Honda and Toyota since 1976 | This Odyssey makes a loud noise after driving on the highway for a few hours | Maybe power steering | Don't know and the dealer says they would not be able to find it till it is happening which is never when I am in town or when they are open | I am thinking to trade it for a sienna | Never heard of not finding a problem like that | Don't they have computerized systems that find problems | Not happy with service at Springfield Honda so may trade | If I do I will never buy another Honda | Want this dealt with before my warranty is up | 
 "words": Well I wish Honda had been a little more truthful in their mpg est | the sticker said 16-22 mpg | real life 14-16 | just awful | I also tow a pop-up trailer w this van and even though it is rated at 3500 lbs | w the tow pkgit still has a difficult time pulling 1400 lbs | Am currently looking for a different vehicle | But for someone who doesn't care about gas efficiency this van would do fine | It is comfortable w a car like ride | However the handling is a bit sloppy | 
 "words": The car tends to pull to the left on the highway | This makes it less than comfortable to drive long distances and rather unsafe | Otherwise interior and exterior design are solid | 
 "words": Great vehicle so far no problems | Excellent gas mileage for a van avg | 17 | 5 city and just got 25 on the highway during a recent trip | A little road noise on some pavement | Excellent handling much more agile than the Sienna | 
 "words": 14000 miles so far MPG is crap all highway driving no matter how fast or type of terrain no better than 21 far cry from 28 on sticker | Going in tomorrow for power steering issues transmission that is slow to respond when starting out | Had problems several problems with an 05 so traded it for an 07 should have traded for a Domestic | Honda should be held responsible for the misrepresentation of the gas mileage | 
 "words": Salesman told me I would do better than the Toyota Sienna I traded in which was a lie | Toyota Sienna got 19 combined city highway and 28 highway | Honda Odyssey gets 16 1 2 combined city highway and 21 highway which is a big disappointment | 
 "words": Loved this car at purchase now five months later its problems are obvious | Gas mileage for city driving is the worst low teens at best | Couple this with a transmission that is way too eager to downshift the car will not coast at low speeds foot must always be on the accelerator | and you have the king of all gas guzzlers | The brakes are too soft and getting softer by the day really emphasizes the car's bulk when your leg hurts just trying to get it to stop | These flaws make it impossible to enjoy driving this car | I would expect these kind of issues from a so-so vehicle but not a Honda | Won't be getting one again | Can't believe I miss my old Caravan | 
 "words": Getting on average 19-21 MPG with mixed driving including hills | Most of the time the ECO light is on and I don't jump on the gas not that you need to | Power steering pump and left front ball joint had to be replaced w in 1st year but dealership stepped up | Overall we are happy | My wife liked it b c it drives and interior feels like her 2003 Accord | 
 "words": Impressive overall but does not shift as smoothly as the Caravan although mileage has held at about 20 mpg about the same as the Dodge | The controls are confusing especially for a person accustomed to driving American-designed cars are you listening Japan | Power doors should have a disconnect feature to allow you to open them easy to open without power assist like the Dodge | Plush interior is on a par with my father-in- law's Avalon | Auto climate control for the rear zone variable heat setting for the seats roof rack bars should be standard equipment at this trim level like on the Dodge | Love the van but do not feel it is worth a 4000 to 6000 premium over the Dodge | 
 "words": Loved our old Odyssey but it started having problems | Now we get in our brand new Odyssey and the first thing I think is I HATE THIS VAN every time it rains all the windows fog up so bad we cant see takes over an hour before they defog told it's a common complaint | Gas mileage is worse than horrid | Impossible to get feet warm unless you sit on them heated seats work | Can't put anything under the console between the two front seats | If something even lightly touches the arm the tray goes down has only happened when the coffee cups are full and of course hot | Can't drive with the windows down the noise is ear piercing | I'd trade it in for a different Make if I could afford it | 
 "words": Be sure you need a van the bulk gets to you after a while | On HWY and or snow its unbeatable | On hills low speed it is not great | If you do town driving and like good MPG then buy something else | MPG will get better after 15000 | Transmission droning sound especially at 1500 RPM which is where it likes to stay is true or 1500 RPM gets rid of the drone | Pay extra for rear parking assist | VCM works well but the 08 model had 34 or 6 cyl operation | 
 "words": Overall the van is OK but the mileage is awful | Nowhere near the EPA posted rating even with the 3mpg | We found this shocking having owned a Honda Accord in the past and the gas mileage was one of the things we were happy about | Honda needs to investigate this issue and correct and not have the dealers tell the customer it's hot in the summer or it must be the way you drive | Spring summer fall or winter and irrespective of how you drive the gas mileage in the city will barely crack 14 mpg | 
 "words": This is my second review | My first was right after the purchase | I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the mileage especially on an EX- L | I own a EX and when it was new the mileage was a little disappointing | Live in Chicago Took a trip to Michigan with it | With the Van full of people and luggage doing 75mph on cruise I Got 23 | 2 mpg | My best in the city after first oil change was 19 mpg I was pretty impressed | I noticed that now it has 6200 miles the mileage has improved | I keep my climate control on auto all the time and idle the van because of the cold before driving | 
 "words": Never should have traded in our 2004 Odyssey | This car maybe gets 13 miles per gallon no matter how we drive | The automatic doors need to be repaired | There is a radio antenna in the window so the reception is poor at best | A tremendous amount of interior noise | Problem with transmission | Van always bucking when you decelerate | Unable to duplicate they say | All in all a piece of crap | Please do not buy this Van | Honda should be ashamed of themselves | 
 "words": Great van so far never have any problems yet | A little road noise compare to 02 odyssey | Sliding doors hard to open also when closed especially from outside | Handling and steering very nice | Poor gas mileage average 16 in town dealer said after 5000 miles will improved | Only like style changing from 02 model | 
 "words": I traded a 2004 Ody EX for the 2007 Ody LX because I was really taken by the new design | I know am of the impression that I could have kept my 2004 and been just as happy if not happier | Overall the 2007 model design is an improvement over the 2004 model but the execution has a lot to be desired | I noticed an engine drone noise at 180 miles | Honda says its characteristic of vehicle harmonics | What nonsense | At 400 miles noticed whining buzzing noise from power steering pump | I took it in to the dealer and was told that they could not duplicate prob | Drove the vehicle myself and brought back to dealer while making noise | They finally acknowledge issue with 05-07 power steering pumps | 
 "words": We bought ours new in March 2007 | The interior heats up very quickly however hardly any air comes out down by your feet | Can't even feel it | It will blow a little harder if you turn off your side air vents but then your side windows start to fog up | My sunroof leaks while in the car wash have been sprayed right in the face many times | The windows will sometimes roll down by themselves whether you are driving the van or in the store shopping | I was actually locked INSIDE the vehicle once | Everyone else got out and when I tried to the door wouldn't budge | The locks were all up | I had to lock and unlock them to get out | Very scary if you have small children and most van owners do | 
 "words": Has both 08 Sienna limited and 07 Odyssey EX-L Navi | Like about Odyssey- stereo brakes and handling | Dislikes- rough ride | 2nd row seat is too firm | 3rd row seat is too narrow | Navi-screen is big but has less resolution and color | Plus the rear view camera uses cheaper CMOS sensor | Which makes rear-view camera useless compare to Sienna | Don't like all of the door switch is on the driver side | No door switch on the b- pillar | Biggest gripe- Gas mileage is horrible | Averaging 14 | 3 | My Sienna gets 20 | 7 | The old 04 Sienna we owned averaged 21 | 3 through 70k miles | 
 "words": Bought 07 EX-L as compliment to our 08 Sienna since cost is so cheap | Things i like about Odyssey- handling and steering response is great | Excellent brakes | Audio is better than 35k Sienna | Things I hate- Rides too stiff | The power sliding door control is located on the driver side | No sliding door control on the b-pillar | Honda also cheaped out on the rear view camera and LCD screen for the navi | The rear view camera is not as clear nor as colorful as the Sienna it is almost totally useless | The gas mileage is just horrible | At 1100 miles Odyssey is averaging 14 | 3 mpg | The Sienna at 1500 miles is averaging 20 | 7 mpg | The old 04 Sienna i had averaged 21 | 3 mpg through 70k | 
 "words": We turned in our 2004 Odyssey LX expecting to get better performance from the re-designed 2007 LX | It turned out to be one of the worst vehicles I've ever owned over the last 43 years behind the wheel | It seems like we visit the gas stations every time we take it out | And as you can seewe only travel an average of 7500 miles per year | I would estimate the true MPG to be around 10 MPG CITY and about 18 MPG highway | Pathetic | I should have opted to keep the 2004 LX | Another factor to stay with the Odyssey was the convenience of the side door windows that can be opened | We hardly use them because of the excessive pounding thumping wind noise that occurs when you're going over 15 MPH | 
 "words": Traded our 05 Pilot because we needed the convenience of a mini van | Tested the Odyssey and Sienna | Althugh we liked the features of the Sienna more the Odyssey drove and handled much better | Biggest dissapointment is with the fuel mileage | With our AWD Pilot we got about 19 overall | With the same type driving in our Odyssey we get 16 | Also some minor interior rattles and creaks which are annoying | 
 "words": We went to the dealership to look at a used Pilot | The Odyssey was sitting next to it so it was easy to compare them side by side | The Odyssey must be 50 bigger inside with 3 rows of very roomy comfortable seating for full- size humans and the 07 van was only a couple grand more than the 04 Pilot | Adults wouldn't last long in the Pilot's 3rd row | The Odyssey sold itself on the test drive | There's lots of storage cubbies and cup holders galore | We had to give up 4WD but you can't have everything | We're averaging 18 mpg about what I hoped for | The certified used car warranty beats new car coverage | My wife loves driving the Odyssey so it looks like we made the right decision | 
 "words": The Odessey stands out from all competitors | Terrific ergonomics high quality interior component design materials and performance great styling considering it is a minivan and lots of fun to drive | I was surprised at how well it handlesve preferring this to our Mercedes for in town driving | We are large dog people | An 85lb | lab lives like a king in the back with the center row seats in on long trips | I often use this rather than our pickup to haul loads | Expect 20MPG combined unless you drive at 50MPH average speed with infrequent stops | All EPA estimates are overstated | This is no exception | 
 "words": I bought this van to replace a full- size Chevy Express conversion van with an 8-cylinder engine | I was hoping for much better gas mileage with the Odyssey than I got with the big van | It hasn't happened | The very best mileage I've gotten with the Odyssey is 14 mpg combined highway and city driving | I usually get around 12 | 9 mpg in the city | I got better average mileage with the big conversion van and also with two previous 6-cylinder Acura Legends a 1989 a 1993 | I'm hoping something is just wrong with the van and they can fix it | It's a fine van otherwise | 
 "words": Looked long and hard and having owned a 2001 ODY for past seven years we got our fifth Honda product a 2007 ODY Touring | We drove Chrysler T Ctop of line 2008 Sienna 2008T O L Hyundai Entourage 2007 Limited Ultimate Pkge | Entourage would have been second choice but it couldn't match Honda's tight turning | The 2007 Honda reliability and fit and finish is still up to high standards | Handling is superb | Our old ODY was a really great reliable inexpensive car to operate | I assume the 2007 will be the same | We are just Honda people | If you are one you'll know what's special about these vans
 "words": Well despite reading about the MPG problems the family bought an 07 Odyssey | We have owned 5 Hondas and have always been very happy with them | In fact right now we have an 03 Accord and love it | With that said the Odyssey is a comfortable vehicle | Unfortunately the mileage is absolutely terrible | Over the course of 3k miles we have averaged 14 MPG | The Ford Explorer we replaced ave 16 MPG | We just can't seem to do better than 14 MPG regardless of how we drive | You can literally see the fuel guage going down | It stays on F for about 25 miles | All I can say with the price of gas going up make sure you explore your other options and know that the MPG warnings are true | 
 "words": I have kept a log on my gas mileage since purchasing my Odyssey in August of 07 and bought the Odyssey for its advertised gas mileage | I owned a Chrysler Town and Country for 10 years and my 10 year old van got better gas mileage than this Odyssey | I'm getting 15 city and no more than 19 | 5 Hwy | My sticker advertises 19 26 | It is very disappointing | Also I have had trouble with the transmission being slow to change gears from Park to Drive | Took it in today and they put a computer update on the van to speed the delay but it didn't work | It is also sluggish from 10-40 mph with the so called Economy feature kicking on and off to save gas | Poor engineering for gas mileage and transmission | 
 "words": We purchased our 2007 Odyssey to replace a 2004 Toyota Sienna and I wish I could trade back | Fuel economy is unbelievably bad | We live in the country about 30 miles from anywhere and have yet to exceed 16mpg | I've tried setting the cruise on a relatively flat road and then reset the mileage calculator it still won't get better than 17 | The instant fuel economy often drops to below 10mpg on level roads and seems to get worse when the 'ECO' light is on | The dealer said it's within the stated range so too bad | This performance should be embarrassing to Honda | The Odyssey is only marginally 1-2 mpg better than my full-size full-time 4x4 Expedition with a 5 | 4 liter V-8 |
