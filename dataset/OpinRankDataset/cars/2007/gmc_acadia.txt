REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased one of the earliest Acadias April 2007 the top of the line version with all the features AWD etc | Truck was great for about 8 months and then I had one of the software updates applied and it changed something about the transmission in a significant way | I could tell immediately upon picking up the vehicle | Car can't find right gear to be in sluggish up the slightest hills poor gas mileage 13mpg max poor acceleration wheezing | Well 2 weeks and 3 days ago at 37800 miles THE END | Tranmission crapped out with my whole family in the car | Guess what | No Acadia transmissions available at all because GM's suppliers have cut back production | Who knows how long I'll wait | 
 "words": We had 3 engine failures in about a year | s period of time | For no apparent reason the engine would just stop | It didn't matter if we were in traffic on a major highway or making a turn | When the engine quits you no longer have brakes or steering that the average person could use | We ask GMC to get us into another Acadia since our lives were being put at risk in this car but all they did was offer to extend our OnStar | 
 "words": I have some serious quality concerns regarding the reliability of my Acadia as it accumulates miles | First the odometer failed and just got it back from the dealer | had to replace the transmission after 25k miles | Plan on trading it in for a more reliable brand model | 
 "words": We purchased the car in 2007 and noticed the acceleration was poor especially when A C is on | Hit 36000 miles memorial day weekend and since then the waterpump and transmission sensor have been replace | Now car is whining and was told in normal cars they have power steering but this car doesn't and it is electrical and you not what that means more money | Overall this is not a reliable vehicle | Service department now knows my name but they are good at making the repairs | 
 "words": I have had my Acadia for over 2 years now and I still really love to drive it | Gets good gas mileage for me 20 combined stereo is amazing tons of room and plenty of power for getting around town | The only thing I will say is that even though I am meticulous about maintaining it it is starting to develop some creaks and rattles and the dealer cant seem to be able to fix them | Nothing major but still slightly annoying for a 38K car | I have heard about problems with sunroofs and radios but luckily I hate sunroofs so I don't have one and my radio works great | Also for everyone that complains of it shifting alot who cares | Its not like it noticeable since its so smooth | 
 "words": Purchased used w-15204 miles Aug | 2008 | Really enjoy taking a road trip in it | extremely comfortable quiet w-great visibility optioned out | Even has a console cup holder night light | Vehicle has had a constant front end problem-pulling to the right | Front end has been re-alinged twice and today dealer advises 2 front tire eaten up 1 down to the core on inside edge hidden | Still at dealer attempting to find out what the problem is for 2 days | Mileage is not good even though recall and service bulletin issues have supposedly been fixed | Gets a little better after being serviced but goes back to bad days later | We love the car but wish these two issues could be fixed | 
 "words": We have had numerous repair issues with the ignition sunroof leaking windshield wiper motors replaced several times lumbar supports power locks power steering gear box and today electronics with brake light beeping and park assist malfunction and cruise out | Buyer beware not a long term reliable vehicle from our experience
 "words": We purchased the Acadia in Feb 2007 and 2 1 2 years later the transmission failed | The dealership admitted to a bulletin being issued about the transmission | We had a recall repaired with the transmission like most a few years ago but it is now completely shot | Thank God for the extended warranty because GMC is not willing to repair or replace this defective transmission in my two year old car | I am disappointed to say the least | The radio is defective as well they have replaced it twice | I loved this car even though it was in and out of the shop for recalls but this is a lemon | I will be speaking to attorney | 
 "words": We have had this vehicle for 3 years and love it for soccer mom duty and ever family trip | The gas mileage posted on our window was 28mpg highway | Which is not even close | I was say 22 at best and we have the front wheel drive only version | We average 16mpg | The stated towing is 6000lbs | We tried towing a 5000lbs trailer once this vehicle could not do it | I will never tow with it again | The transmission is a little shifty also but this was improved with an updated last year | We do love it and it is one of the best vehicles we have ever owned though | 
 "words": I have been driving my 2007 Acadia for 2 full years and I still love it | I commute 30 miles one way and spend a lot of time in the vehicle on trips | The comfort and features make it a joy to drive | I had it in the shop only one time before warranty expired for very minor issues and one recall and it has not needed any other repairs | I get 18MPG in town 24MPG on the highway very close to what is promised | I prviously drove a 98 Oldsmobile minivan and a 2003 Chevy Tahoe | This Acadia has as much room as the minivan but is much more stylish and comfortable and it is much more roomy and functional than the Tahoe | Highly recommend to families with small children or teenagers | 
 "words": Had this SUV for about a month now and already put on 2000 KM | The fuel mileage is about what I expected getting about 25 mpg hwy and 17 mpg city not too bad | Love the way this vehicle handles and is able to carry lots of stuff | 
 "words": Purchased approximately two weeks ago so far not disappointed at all | Interior design is excellent but I have also noticed the glare on the A C vents mentioned in other reviews but not a serious issue for me | The motor and transmission are extremely smooth and I don't have any problems with the six speed it wants to get into 5-6 gears as quick as possible but a slight tap on the accelerator down shifts it quickly | Mileage overall is aveaging about 18 | 5 mpg in a blend of 50 city highway | A 100 mile interstate trip did deliver 22 and I averaged 75 mph | You can't do that in my '03 Tahoe which I traded | 
 "words": Just took a 1300 mile round trip with the Acadia filled with 3 people the dog and all our luggage etc | Drove through pouring rain and up north through the mountains and never skipped a beat | Best part avg over 22 mpg round trip driving about 75 on interstate and varying through 2 lane mountain roads | Very good family vehicle | 
 "words": The Acadia is basically a good-looking well performing comfortable reliable stylish fun to drive minivan thats actually a crossover | Comfortable back rows are surprisingly big enough for an adult to sit comfortable for a 5-hour trip | It has been problem free craftmanship A | So sharp looking along with the brick red leather interior A | Fuel economy great | The HID headlights LED taillights just make it seem like it is a good looking minivan that's actually a crossover so it performs like a car made by a luxury brand | A | 
 "words": The vehicle handles extremely well and the features make it a car worth having | 
 "words": Previous to this purchase the last GM car I owned was 1963 Corvair given to me by my father | Since then I have owned a Honda Prelude a Madza RX-7 an Infiniti G20 and a Jeep Grand Cherokee a very good SUV | This GMC Acadia is the best road vehicle I have ever owned and proves that Detroit is back on the block | Now I need GMC to create a sports car for my short city drives although I might consider the Pontiac or Sky | 
 "words": I got my 2007 Acadia 7-7-07 I am very pleased with this car | I read many reviews and took 2 months to decide on a car that would suit my family of 6 | Children ages 451012 | This car is fun to drive we get lots of stares and compliments from strangers | The kids really enjoy the DVD player and the Sky Scape I like the sunroof and the auto headlights | It's super comfy to ride in | I got the 7 seating with 4 captains chairs so it would be easier for the kids to climb into the back although you can slide the seats back and down they usually get to the car before me and I didnt want to have a 3 rows of seats all muckied up by their footprints so this was better for us | 
 "words": Fun to drive vehicle | Convenience of a very large SUV packaged with the drive handling accesories amenities styling of a premium luxury sedan | We were set on buying a competitor and imported SUV vehicle but the Acadia had everything we wanted and more for the price | Safety was a key point | Good gas mileage for an AWD optioned car too | 
 "words": Would like more hp when accelerating to get onto freeway or pass another vehicle vehicle is a little sluggish in that area | Fuel economy is o | k | 17 mpg city | Otherwise overall excellent ride so far | 
 "words": I was very impressed with the drive and style of my new Acadia | I feel that the transmission would run more efficiant had it been larger | Sometime the transmission dosent know what to do | I took it for a 15 hr one way road trip to Tampa Florida and it drove great other than giving me the advertised fuel mileage | Overall I get many looks of impressed people when I drive it | GMC has to be commended for a job well done makes you want to keep buying American | 
 "words": I love this car | I can convert the seats easliy to carry cargo or the kids for carpooling | I can leave my cargo in the car and still carry 5 kids | Very versital and fun to drive | The low gas mileage is an issue but the space and handling make up for it | If you need a minivan but don't want to drive one buy this car | It has the space and features of a minivan without the stigma of it |

 "words": It drives good could use more power | Nice size | Has had 3 recalls | When driving at noon the reflection off of the ac vents will blind you | I have 7000 mi and mileage is not what is on the sticker | Love the XM and OnStar | 
 "words": Traded the '07 Caddy Escalade | Almost identical interior and options | However the Acadia is better more storage easier to adjust the rear seats back seats fold down | Miles per gallon need I say anymore | Improvements over the Caddy pricestoragedouble moonroof rear seats move back an forth for taller passengers amazing leg room for thrid seat passengers and easier to use options | 
 "words": Just took delivery of our new Acadia in the medium brown with black leather | Drives a lot better than our previous Pathfinder | If the reliability is there I may have to continue with GM | The styling is great and the practical use of space is perfect inside | We were very close to getting the Buick Enclave nicer style and more luxury inside but my wife and I are just not ready to drive a Buick | Maybe in 10 years or so | 
 "words": I have not purchased a new domestic vehicle since my 1974 Camaro SS | The Acadia is the first vehicle since that attracted me enough to make the switch | While the MPG isn't quite where I hoped it would be I am averaging around 20 mpg with a combo of heavy freeway stop and go traffic | On a recent road trip to Arizona I averaged about 24mpg which I was quite satisfied with | I am very happy with this vehicle | For a versatile all around utility vehicle with style and comfort I don't think that you can beat it | 
 "words": An excellent family hauler | I love the remote start feature where it turns on the heater and seat warmers or AC depending on the temperature | Drives great rides great excellent steering nice interior touches and the great exterior appearance | Very comfortable seats | Tows our camper with ease but there is always a need for more HP and torque | 
 "words": We have enjoyed our Acadia and having over 1000 miles we are ready for the road ahead | The engine noise a little noisy on heavy acceleration the dash imperfection is anoying but I had the dealership take care of this | I could not have abuilt a better vehicle myself |

 "words": This is the perfect car for our family | It is comfortable easy to drive and perfectly arranged inside | The fuel economy is decent for a vehicle of this size and it drives so well | In the last month I haven't been able to find anything about this car that I don't like | 
 "words": Before you take a trip read all details in the manual | Lots of buttons to learn about before you push them | Do not rely on the Park Assist horn to warn you | Watch the amber lite and stop dead when three lights are lit | 
 "words": I've had the truck for only a couple of weeks so far but I've already noticed the gas mileage is way below advertised | I'm only getting about 15 mpg | It looks great though it rides smooth and the kids love the sunroof and DVD player | The chrome trim does reflect too much sunlight in your eyes | It's my first GMC so we'll see how reliable it is | It rides more like a sedan than a truck very comfortable | 
 "words": This new SUV CUV or whatever you want to call it is simply outstanding | I can only add my voice to the hundreds of positive reviews | Everyone wants to check out my vehicle and thanks to the versatility of this vehicle I can take 7 of them with me in comfort | Finally real 3rd row seating for adults or cavernous cargo capacity if required | Awesome utility aside the vehicle is gorgeous and has GMC professional grade all over it | Cannot recommend this enough | A true joy for both driver and passenger | the ultimate family vehicle | 
 "words": The Acadia is one great vehicle | Gas mileage is averaging about 21 mpg combined city and highway driving which is great for that size vehicle | I love the way it looks and handles | Easily makes sharp turns and parking is a breeze | Go GM | 
 "words": I just took a 1000 mile trip and was miserable | I kept hitting my head on the tilted head of the seat and had a crick in my neck my entire trip | The seats are so firm they feel hard | The lumbar support feels like it never releases and both drivers on my trip had backaches | The only positive was the front window has good visibility in the rain | I am sorry I bought this car since I travel frequently | The FM radio has poor reception so you must pay for XM | The car is slow and the gas pedal is hard to push and you must lift your foot at a severe angle to reach | I can't believe I read so many good reviews | This car is slow eats gas and is just plain uncomfortable | 
 "words": I love cars and have had a lot of nice ones | This is by far the best I've had for some hauling use of space comfort and quietness | For the first time in many years I find new reasons to drive somewhere | We also have a Mini S convertible which is a very nice car but I'll choose the Acadia to use over that | GM really did their homework on this car | 
 "words": Great value and mileage for such a big vehicle | It does everything I need it to do | I love it | It will turn heads as it looks great

 "words": Congratulations GMC this car blows away the competition | The styling is excellent and unlike others complaints I see about inital gas mileage I am averaging 20mpg in heavy Chicago area traffic where my average speed is about 17mph with many starts and stops | I am sure I could make it average a lot less like some of the complaints here if I really tried by accelerating hard | This is a great alternative to gas guzzling large SUV's or mini-vans | The ride and quiet interior are better than the Acura we own or the Volvo we used to own | Best in class legroom for all three rows of seating without sacrificing cargo space | 
 "words": I really enjoy it and hope to stay in the GMC family for a long time | This pretty much summed up all I wanted | It has the space of a full size SUV yet the class of a luxury car and the styling of a sporty SUV | Like i said everything I could have possibly asked for | 
 "words": Really enjoy the comfort and features of the Acadia | Only complaint is the transmission could be smoother a problem I anticipate them fixing for the next model year | The leather seats are very comfortable | The suspension is very smooth | Highly recommend the parking assist | 
 "words": Really a great vehicle | Beyond my expectations | GM is finally getting it right | Should have no problem getting market share back from Toyota | 
 "words": I've only had it for a little over a week but so far loving it | The only negative is the fuel economy | My kids love the dual moonroof and the DVD player | I love the way it handles | I loved my Honda Odyssey but I was ready to not have a Mommy Mobile and this fits the bill | I still have room to cart around my children's friends without having to drive a van | I have never purchased American but so far so good | I was also deciding between Mazda CX-9 and Acadia and after talking to my mechanic he pushed me to the GMC | He said Mazda parts are hard to get and American made vehicles have come a long way over the last several years | 
 "words": The Acadia handles well and is doesn't handle or float around like a large SUV | It has received multiple unsollicited compliments in parking lots and several impromptu tours | 
 "words": Expecting equal or better fuel economy to my last vehicle which was a Jeep I was disappointed to only get about 14mpg average 30 lower than expected | The ride is smooth although after 3 months rattles with the doors and undercarrage have started to appear a few features like the rear wiper switch being on the highbeam switch which easily gets turned on by mistake when switching the highbeams | and chrome accents that reflect the sun in your eyes | But for the little amount of snow I drove it in the handling and traction was great Don't let anyone lean on your Acadia as the panels dent easy | For a GM vehicle it was better than expected but still not great | 
 "words": An outstanding presentation by GM | The fit and finish of the Acadia brings GMC to the level of the Asian or Europeans | Attention to detail and the overall driving experience has been outstanding | The capability and size of the Acadia is masked by outstanding agility fabulous ride and wonderful driving experience | The second and third row seating ae designed in a manner which is well thought out | Clearly the third row was not an add on as it is in many smaller cross overs | Adjustable seating in the second row is a sign that GM took the overall needs for 7 passengers seriously | Excellent storage space ergonomics and overall design | 
 "words": I have never owned an American vehicle but really liked the looks of the Acadia | Incredibly the other vehicle I was considering was the Mercedes C class | After 7000 miles 4 months I still have not heard one squeak or rattle and the car drives possibly better than my original test drive | 
 "words": Took delivery a couple of weeks ago | We chose the Acadia over the Mazda CX9 because of the additional interior room and ease of access to the third row | So far we are very happy with the overall purchase except for the terrible gas mileage when compared to what is stated on the sticker | The first tank of gas which was a combined city and highway was 15 mpg | The second and third tanks were 100 city driving in Houston Texas and we are getting 12 mpg | a huge dissapointment because we get this same 12 mpg with our Yukon XL and Ford Expedition | both of which are V8s | Hopefully this will improve | 
 "words": I was very concerned buying a new GM vehicle after owning a Honda Pilot for the last 4 yrs and picked this over the new MDX | This vehicle is much quieter on the hiway is larger inside more HP and same gas mileage as the Pilot | Love the dark carpets even with the taupe leather very comfy seats and hidden receiver hitch chrome door handles | Wish I could've purchased front moonroof only | Tranny can't decide which gear to pick on hills at hiway speed nature of the 6 speed beast | Highly recommend backup sensors due to small tailgate window | 
 "words": My last car was the Cadilac SRX | The new Acadia is vastly better in all aspects | I can not emphasize how much I have enjoyed driving the car in the first 30 days of purchase | The only correction that needs to be made is the acceleration at high speed and initial fuel economy | Going in for an adjustment this week | GMC has made a car that my friends call a big Lexus 350 | Top quality and a great ride
 "words": We were trying to downsize and I glanced over and saw this vehicle | As soon as I found out it seated 8 with center bench I told the dealer to bring it to the house | My wife wasn't sure at first but after driving it and seeing the Acadia in white she loved it | We ordered one which took 6 weeks but was worth the wait | What a class vehicle | Before buying an import do yourself a favor and check this one out | The only thing we left off was heads up and nav system | I will use a portable nav | Had a Z71 sub and this drives like a Cadillac in comparison | Our first road trip is coming up will keep posted | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle | The ride is smooth as befits a large car | It is responsive and it is very comfortable in all three rows of seats | Although there are a lot of controls they are well laid out and intuitive to use | For a large vehicle it is quite maneuverable and fairly easy to park | The power rear lift gate is surprisingly handy | While gas mileage isn't great it is pretty good for such a large vehicle | Bottom line I don't especially enjoy driving but I actually look forward to driving my new Acadia | 
 "words": Very surprised by quiet interior even on interstate in windy conditions smooth ride and very comfortable seats | Transmission can't decide when to shift at times making for less smooth drive then the Pilot or MDX | So far so good after leaving a Pilot and picking the Acadia over an MDX | GM has done their homework | 
 "words": The Acadia has more than lived up to my expectations | Handling is terrific and the 6-speed performs better than anticipated with the software fix GM has applied | A fun functional and very comfortable vehicle | Turns a lot of heads | 
 "words": I bought this after comparing a Tahoe Pilot Edge Sequoaya Highlander Outlander CX-9 and Explorer | I can't be happier with my decision after several months | I got the brick interior heads up display and huge sunroof | it catches everyones eye | The captain's chairs are nice and the third row seats are much more spacious than other full size SUVs | The fit and finish of the interior is finally on par with European vehicles | Forget the comments about the plastic it is fine | The tranny downshifts sluggishly but that is to save gas | I average 20 | 5MPG with city congestion driving | There are some comments about rust on the exhuast this is the stainless steel discoloring
 "words": We have had our Acadia for 3 weeks and drove to South Carolina and back from NY without any problems | Very comfortable 15hrs of driving straight | We drove through snow sleet wind rain and sun | It handled great in every aspect | We have two young kids | They had plenty of room for all the toys and things to keep them occupied for 15hrs |

 "words": I don't know if it's the smell of a new vehicle or that I'm driving around town in an Acadia that has put a smile on my face | We sold our reliable conservative Honda Odyssey for a bit of luxury in the fully loaded minus Nav SLT2 Carbon Metallic with Ebony leather interior | It's a great looking vehicle inside and out causing it to be a looker on the road and sitting in carpool | We bought the extended warranty to give us more piece of mind regarding reliability | Expected a little better fuel economy | 
 "words": We purchased this car after comparison of Pilot and CX-9 | Our expectations were exceeded | Family members are very happy with it especially kids | Acadia is very roomy and styling | Ride is quiet and very comfortable | 
 "words": I am a BMW fanatic however I decided to take a look at the GMC Acadia and I was pleasantly surprised | Amazingly doing 60 MPH feels like you are still around 35 | It is a very solid and smooth crossover vehicle | 
 "words": I expect the Acadia will sell very well because it has nearly everything a family w 3 kids is looking for if you vehemently opposed to driving owning a minivan | Most of the features of a minivan without the ridicule from your friends and family | Hard to put a price tag on that | We researched and looked at nearly every third-row SUV and kind of stumbled upon the Acadia and were pleased to find that it had all of the features that we valued | Roomy enough trunk space with the third row up easy-in and easy-out with the captain's chairs and better mileage than the very large SUV's | Overall we've been very happy with the Acadia | 
 "words": Leased the vehicle thinking I would get close to the the MPG listed as I mostly drive at highway speeds and few if any stops | Best MPG I have gotten so far is 16 | 4 but avg only 14 | 7 weekly | I was told this engine would break in and I would get better MPG but after 1200 miles I doubt this will come up that much to match the sticker claims | I love this car as it meets every other need I have but to suffer at the pumps is getting the best of me | I also have a problem with the transmission not always being in the proper gear on grades | This could be a major factor in the low MPG | I recommend GM look into this further | I grow more angry at every fill-up 
 "words": I just bought this car for my wife | Carbon Metallic with Ebony Leather the DVD player and dual sunroofs everything is on it | I have to say the car is great | Tows well drives like a car and my wife loves it | No doubt it will be in my garage for another 5 years | If crossovers SUVs are what you are looking for just don't bother and buy this car |

 "words": This is a remarkable vehicle with almost every feature a luxury vehicle should have | I traded in my Infiniti QX4 so I had high expectations from the beginning | I | m used to a bit more luxury with leather surrounds on the doors and dash but have tried overlooking this in favor of the 7 passenger seating which is very practical with the grandkids | It | s one of the easiest vehicles to get passengers into the third row seat and I | m guessing that other manufactures will follow suit soon | It | s also the quietest vehicle I | ve driven in years | It | s so quiet that you can | t hear the engine shifting gears unless you mash the accelerator | 
 "words": We were impressed with all the supposedly included features until we actually bought the car and found out many of them do not function in all the models | ie the drivers information center on the base models | We felt the features could be changed to meet our needs | After having the car truck for a week we have found out that while they are there and functioning they only function the way the engineers at GMC choose to make them function | In particular is the door locks | They lock as expected when you put the car into gear | The problem is they unlock automatically when ever you put the Acadia into park | ie waitng at a train crossing in the worse part of town |

 "words": Let me first say that I have never owned any General Motors product and at last count have owned at least a dozen new cars and several used cars | This CUV has chcanged me though what a vehicle | GM has done their homework and provided the best of SUVs and Minivans in one sharp looking and fun to drive vehicle | Our family is headed out on a spring break vacation so I hope to write more about our impressions from that trip | Look out all other SUVs CUVs and minivans the General has a winnder on their hands |

 "words": After looking at number of different CUVs SUVs we chose the Acadia | Partly because it is a new vehicle and American made but mostly because we felt it was the best vehicle in the category | In case you are wondering I do consider this vehicle to be in the same category as the XC90 RX350 MDX 4Runner and Pilot all of which we looked at carefully and considered buying | The GMC name certainly does not carry the prestige but the style features and initial quality of this car meets or exceeds them all although time will tell in the reliability department | This is a great riding vehicle and has outstanding interior space similar to Tahoe for its deceptive exterior size |

 "words": We needed a larger vehicle as our family is getting bigger and sold a Honda Civic for this family room on wheels | It fits everything from baby seats a dog tons of luggage coolers and gets you from A to B comfortably | We knew gas would be more expensive coming from a 32 mpg Civic but the size and comfort level are well worth the sacrifice | The funny thing is that people don't realize that these are like minivans on the inside and can accomodate many passengers with the utmost comfort | The truck has taken up a bit more space in the garage than expected but we'll get by | This will be in our family for a long time and I would suggest this vehicle to anyone consaidering a minivan |

 "words": I researched this vehicle for several months before making the purchase | In the 1 yr that I have owned the vehicle it has been in the shop multiple times for various reasons | The first 3 times was because the passenger side floor board was flooded because the drain from the sunroof was not installed and when my dealer did install it it was done incorrectly | Then carpet had to be replaced | Transmission in the vehicle is not what it should be | I had the software update but car continues to shift up and down with little regard to terrain Now it is in the shop related to what they say are body seam cracks | I love this car the way it rides the looks and the interior comfort | 
 "words": Excellent ride and plenty of room | Have all electronic features except back-up camera and find them all useful | Major complaint is the number of bugs that had to be worked out on the 2007 model | Average mpg is around 20 with significant highway driving | Cannot drive above 40 with rear windows down vibrations feel like car is going to shake apart | Major flaw in otherwise great sound system is that it has only a single-CD DVD player

 "words": It has been a great SUV with spacious smooth sporty look | I have been happy for the decision that I have made to purchase this crossover SUV over soccer mom minivan | My whole family especially my kids loving it | They don't want to ride on other vehicles exception this one | My kids ususally have nice sleep and they wouldn't get tired when wake-up after a long trip | I got average 16-18 in city and 22-24 on highway | I really don't like its 6-speed transmission shiftings | It easily gets into low gear at high RPM when going up hill even at 10 degree upward | It has made me feeling that there isn't enough power | 
 "words": I've had my Acadia for close to a year and a half and still absolutely love the vehicle | For the first year we were extremely disappointed with the mpg | I drove a country road to work with one stop two stop signs on it-18 milesand about 10 miles driving in- town | I now keep my speed under 60 mph out of town I don't pass anyone unless they're driving under 50 mph like farm equipment I accelerate slower and coast when approaching a stop sign I always shut the car off and walk-inno drive-ups at the bank McD's etc | and wow what a difference | I've gotten on average 24 mpg in two months it's been between 22 mpg and 28 mpg | A savings of 4 gallons per week You do the math | 
 "words": The car is fun to drive once you reach 20 or so mile per hour but until then it seems to be hesitant to shift into lower gears to give the needed power for moving around in City traffic | I have had the transmission calibrated a couple of times and it helps for a while then it goes back to hesitating | Also the fuel mileage is not even close to what was advertised on the window sticker | The sticker said I should get 18 City and 24 Highway MPG | I get 14 City and 18 to 19 Highway | I asked the service reps about it and they kind of shrug and say thats about normal | Otherwise I like the car a lot and have no real mechanical problems | 
 "words": I bought my Acadia the day I first seen it | It is safe and fun to drive not to mention easy to get into and out of | Only complaint is the interior isn't easy to clean or keep clean | I am a school bus driver and safety is number one with me so believe me when I say the Acadia is tops | In the ice and snow this past year going to work was easyThe kids hate it when bus drivers make it to work So if you drive it once you will fall in love and if you purchase one you will not regret it | 
 "words": I've owned an SLT-1 FWD Acadia for about 8 months and have not regretted the decision one bit | I went with the black metallic exterior with brick interior and can't believe how nice that combination looks | I continue to get compliments in that regard | The 20 tires rims really make the vehicle stand out | The ride is rather smooth especially on the open rode and the handling is very nimble | What I really find impressive is the roominess of the interior | It is very easy to move around and and change the seating positions having captian's chairs is particularly nice | I considered buying the Mazda MX-9 Volvo XC-90 and the Acura MDX | The Acadia is a much better looking vehicle imo | 
 "words": I wanted the space of a full size SUV but not the bulk | When GMC came on the scene with the Acadia in 2007 I knew my prayers had been answered | This crossover SUV is absolutely gorgeous | It's perfect for me and my family | I also ride a sport bike and the tow hitch on the back is perfect for pulling our enclosed trailer as well | You can't go wrong with this truck | It looks good you feel safe and secure with OnStar and XM radio and the rest of the bells and whistles | But just like most vehicles this size it could be better in the gas mileage category | Fortunately I kept my 96 Mazda Protege when I got this so my Acadia is strictly for the weekends and leisure | Way to go GM | 
 "words": I've had my Acadia for one year and I love it | I did the transmission software update and it made a big difference | Unfortunately the dealership goofed it up when they did it and it was registering 3 | 1 miles on the odometer for every one mile I drove | I checked the mileage with with the highway milemarkers | The front end makes a clunking noise when just starting to take off | I learned from another review that the clunking noise is the anti-lock breaking system engaging | Other than these two issues I love my Acadia | I hope everyone else's issues are resolved quickly | 
 "words": I just love this car and I am very pleased with the quality and service I have received | I get in the car and it seems like the car does all the driving for me sometimes I forget where I am going and I miss my destination | Only thing I wish I had was XM radio but other than that it has everything that I need | I am gonna upgrade with the same vehicle in a couple of years | GMC has once again out done themselves | Great job | 
 "words": We like our 2007 Acadia | It would be love if not for the annoying vibration of the steering wheel column and the constant whiny sound coming from the transmission or steering wheel | Gas mileage is terrible even worse after we had the computer software update | Moving east and will soon be shopping for AWD | If GMC doesn't get its act together with this steering column transmission issues the Honda Pilot might be our next new vehicle purchase | 
 "words": Traded in a Yukon SLT for this vehicle | Very happen with the driveability of the Acadia | Mileage is not as advertised nor all that much better than a Yukon | Drives more like a car than a truck | Have had mini vans this has almost the same amount of storage space | Have had seals replaced on transfer case already for leaking | Also had a time on freeway where I had to kick it down to passing gear and absolutely nothing happened could have been a potential hazard | Update to vehicle electronics afterward may have rectified problem |

 "words": I really like this SUV because of the size and special features | We did have the power steering pump replaced within the frist three months Which wasn | t really a big deal | In the fourth month of ownership this SUV became demon posessed | Brake light comes on with a very loud beeping that does not stop and the park assist light flashes that the park assist is off | Three trips to the dealership and they still can't fix this problem | The only way to stop this is to pull off the road set and release the park brake | the plus side to this is that it only happens when it rains | four resets in one trip from NJ to NC | There is also water in the passenger floorboard when it rains |

 "words": First let me say that I absolutely love my Acadia but hate the performance and mileage | I thoroughly researched and special ordered one | I have to admit that I did not heed prior reviewers' warnings about the mileage and the sluggish transmission so I take responsibility for my disappointment | I test drove 4 different Acadias and rented one for a weekend and never experienced nearly as bad mileage or the very sluggish response when it is needed most | The closest I can compare it to is a clogged air filter or fuel line | I had it checked and was told it was operating perfectly | If mileage and performance are high on your priority list you should look elsewhere | If not you'll love this car |
