REVIEWS
 "words": Well I'm not satisfied at all | I bought a 2007 Lexus IS 18 months ago and I took a chance on this because there is no local dealer I live 2hrs away | Unfortunately I've had nothing but problems with it | I've gone through 4 tires breaks and a factory recall on the exhaust system in that time | I've been to Springfield twice and to the Toyota dealership 5 times now | I bought a car almost brand new I shouldn't had to bring it in | I brought my car in last week to get the breaks looked at the local Toyota place and the rep told me I had another bad tire 4 so I called Lexus and told them | When I purchased the car I got the tire warranty but they said they wouldn't pay for the tire | 
 "words": The car has almost 45000 miles on it and I still love it | I previously owned an Audi A4 and this car is superior in every way | After the Audi I could not imagine owning a car that was not AWD and was so happy that Lexus made the IS 250 AWD | I looked into the BMW 3 series and a new Audi A4 and concluded that the Lexus offered more for less | The car comes standard with many airbags sun roof excellent stereo memory settings for both the driver and passenger seats and superior leather quality | I opted for the luxury package and this car feels beyond luxury | The car is very sporty but a safe and solid ride | I have a long commute to work and am so happy every day that I have this car | 
 "words": My baby gets 26-27 miles per gallon with premium gas | Had it for 2 years and still runs like brand new with routine oil changes | Everywhere I go it still turns heads | A friend of mine bought one when he fell in love with mine | Here on Guam the dealer provides free car washes so the tire dust isn't an issue | The dealer said the dust is normal because the brake pads are softer than regular pads in order to help the car stop better at high speeds my car can stop on a dime | A friend recommended replacing with ceramic brake pads when the time comes | So I'll be trying that to see if they work the same with less brake dust | 
 "words": This car is very nice however The interior is very cramped the reason being the car was built very narrow the same issue with the GS although the GS has more head room than the IS | If you're driving alone the car's feel is a little better but for the most part it's very cramped inside the interior is built very solid but there was rattling in the dash that was eventually fixed by the dealer | The front rims are always extremely dirty faulty break pad design | Not sure | Handling around tight corners is OK but not great | 
 "words": Totally fun ride with awesome factory sound system | Previously drove an 03 Celica that I loved and was hard to get rid of but this car is like the Luxury Celica Handling and reliability if the Celica with a little more room and luxury and I love it | 
 "words": For a 6 cyl car gas mileage is terrific | Very comfortable especially the adjustable heated and cooled seats | I don't drink coffee in the car so cup holders are not an issue however I definitely would like to see a decent coin holder | My IS 250 now has 12000 miles on it and the dash sounds like it is going to fall off in my lap | The squeaks and rattles in the dash are very very annoying and not expected in a vehicle of this supposed quality | Overall I do like the car however I don't expect that I will keep it the 3 years I initially thought I would when I bought it | 
 "words": I traded in a 2003 Infiniti G35 and was kinda of sick at first but as I drove the 250 even more it was awesome | The only gripes I have had about it is they have 18 inch low profile tires on them and after 15000 miles I had to have a new set of tires | They should have gotten at least 30000 miles before a new set and the brake dust on the front is horrible | It needs a little more room in the back seat | I have owned BMW Infiniti Acura Maxima and Hondas | This is one of the best driving cars I have ever drove | Very tight steeringm can hang a curve and has a lot of get up and go too | I have 3 speeding tickets to prove it | 
 "words": I searched for months for the perfect car | I wanted a small good looking luxury sports car that was safe reliable decent gas mileage and had a good smooth drive | I am so happy with this car | The Lexus definitely drives the best of all cars I have owned including Mercedes and BMW | 
 "words": Had this car over a year | Always driven imports and this is by far my best import car yet | Gas was at 4 dollars and this takes premium so I went with 2 | 5 instead of 3 | 5 | This has a lot of power still and zips through traffic phenomenally | I enjoy this as a daily driver and now have 20K on this clean ride | Love the S curves and everyone loves the interior when they sit in it for drives | Little crowded in the back but hey its still a sports sedan | I use my mp3 player in it all the time | Great leather seats and navigation is a must with reverse camera | The tail is high when reversing without a camera | Slight road noise with Potenzas | I love the sport steering great U turns and stops on a dime | 
 "words": I shopped for an IS 250 AWD for about 5 months before getting one | I have had it for a little over a month and still love it | I have done a 1300 mile road trip and drive it to work every day | I am 27 6 feet tall and my previous car was a 2001 Toyota Celica | Here | s what I think of the IS with reference to the other reviews on here- first yes there is brake dust on front wheels but if you wash your car weekly it | s no biggie | Pops from the dash | Some but it | s usually only when the car is cold after it warms up they stop | I am guessing this is different from car to car | Basically I wanted a luxury Celica- I got one | It | s fast enough for me but I | m no racer | 
 "words": I love driving this car | Looked at Audi BMW Infiniti Acura and Honda and this by far was more to my standings | Yes the back seat is a little small but if you're the one driving who cares | I was torn between the IS 250 and G35 | I liked how the G35 had more room but after doing a cost analysis the IS 250 turned out to be a better purchase | 
 "words": Love driving my 250 after 17 months | Occasionally wish I had bought the 350 but I would rarely use the extra power | The 250 and 350 handle great on freeways country roads or around town | The 250 is a little slow out of the blocks but has great pulling power at higher speeds | I didn't buy the car with safety in mind but this is one solid car | Someone crashed into the back of my car at high speed on a freeway yesterday resulting in one totally written off car and one lightly damaged Lexus | At the time of impact I was pushed into a sideways skid but handling was phenomenal and the car was brought under control easily | 
 "words": I have had my Lexus for a little over a year now and I still love it | It is beautiful extremely comfortable and so fun to drive | My fiance is currently looking for a new car and loves driving mine so much he wants to get one for himself | 
 "words": So this is the most sporty offering from Lexus save for the IS 350 but that's another ballgame | This makes me seriously question Lexus' ability to build a sports car | The ride is great the interior is comfortable the options and gadgets are perfect the exterior looks beautiful but where's the power | Where's the handling | Where's the fun factor | Sure coming from a Honda it's greatly powerful and fun but after recently trading it in and looking at offerings from BMW and Infiniti this car feels like a slowpoke | For not much more a 328 or G35 would be exponentially more fun to drive | Sure the luxury is there which I love and appreciate but the sporting characteristic is not | 
 "words": Car is capable of very good gas mileage | Engine response is delayed and acceleration is weak | However very strong and capable once up to speed on highway | Suspension a little stiff but good on highways | Steering is quick and you need to get accustomed to it | Some break noise from front and terrible brake dust situation with front wheels | Very solid and fun to drive | Test drove a 330i and decided to go with the Lexus | I am satisfied with my decision | 
 "words": The most fun car that I have ever owned | Few minor flaws such as extreme brake dust on front wheels loud popping sound from dash | Overall a great little car | Wish it was a bit bigger on the inside | I have two small kids and even they are cramped in the back seat | Makes me feel young again | Head turner | 
 "words": overall great car | The exterior of the car is sleek and sexy but not nearly as sleek as the interior | The interior is very comfortable and i love the touch screen navigation very user friendly | Only my second car but I like how the seats are heated and cooled | The handling is also phenomenal I can make turns at speeds and make tight U turns I never could have with a 5 series | So far I've gotten the car up to 130 mph and everything worked perfectly including the handling | 
 "words": After 6 months still love the car | 
 "words": I really like the ride | Reliability is really well and as a previous owner of a BMW I prefer a vehicle that is more reliable | Too many problems with BMW 328i | Great car in and out and the women love this car | Great nav Bluetooth and rear camera is a must | Love the performance and the 1 2 second lag is not as bad as others say | Added a short air intake and feels more responsive | IS F-sport coming soon and looking forward to upgrading brakes all the way around | HID Xenon lights are wonderful and the ride is great and responsive | Again this is not a Cadillac it | s a sports car | 
 "words": I shopped the IS with the A4 and the 3 Series | Didn't like the way both Germans' headrests actually touched back of my head in normal driving position | The Lexus trunk was wider better able to take 2 golf bags | I really like the styling of the IS | The build quality is good but not great | My car did have the center dash nav rattles that others complained of but my local dealer seemed to fix it | I am disappointed with the way the car drives | Mine has sport susp | and tires | Handling is great but the ride is too harsh | Sport tires VERY road-noisy | The steering is the major flaw | Very fast and tight but no road feel or feedback | It feels sticky and dead | Very strange | Brakes grabby | 
 "words": It's been a year now since I bought my IS 250 and while it doesn't blow me away I really do like the car | I had a rattle problem with my dash it came from the center speaker | The dealer ended up replacing my whole top dash and now it's much quieter but I'm also getting those loud pops that others are getting | I find the ride very bumpy on bad LA freeways | The suspension seems way too tight | Had a BMW 328i before and while this doesn't handle as well of course it has more interior comforts | I still love the styling and get lots of great comments | Gas mileage is perhaps better than stated | On smooth roads fun to drive | For the it's still hard to beat but I was expecting more | 
 "words": I have owned the IS 250 AWD going on a year now and I still love driving this car | Performance is great and I find that the AWD version handles very well and living in CT the car has done well in the snow | For the money the 250 has many luxurious features but does have a some flaws | I had to have the car seviced twice to try and fix the popping noise from the dashboard and the rattle from the sunroof | Dealership was great and had a fix for both issues | The others would be the jumpy transmission at low speeds first and second gear and the lack of room in the back seat | Overall the IS 250 has delivered and I'm very happy | 
 "words": I've had no problems with lumpy seats or rattles but have heard the pop noise coming from middle of dash | only happens once per trip | Heated cooled seats are great | handles like on rails | plenty of punch but wish the 350 came with AWD | has been great on snow and ice | ride a tad rough but an OK compromise for the handling | very quiet | love the LED interior lights | back seat is cramped but front seat is fine for my 6'4 frame | averaging around 25 mpg | many more features and much more reasonable price than BMW or MB | 
 "words": I love the design all the great luxurious features like the headlights that turn and the cooled seats | The car handles like its on rails rides unbelievably smooth and is quiet and fast | Its by far the best and most reliable car I have ever owned | I'll take it over a BMW any day and for the price | how can you say no | 
 "words": This car has single handedly deteriorated my impression of Lexus quality | My car has 1800 miles and has had to have the brake pads replaced due to excessive constant squeeling after normal flat terrain driving | The front dash has an irritating popping noise constantly that sounds like expansion which I'm told is normal and to simply accept it and we had to bring it in twice to try to find address a rattling noise in the front driver dash | While the service dept is great wouldn't it be better if I didn't have to go in unnecessarily to begin with | Very disappointed will likely not buy a Lexus again | 
 "words": Overall car has been great but I am concerned over the interior quality of the plastic and seats | Lots of rattles coming from the dash area around the navi and entire dash | Have been to several dealers to fix the squeaking and one dealer lifted off the entire dash and reset | Now the rattles are even worse | The front seat has developed a large lump where the fan unit is located so sitting is very uncomfortable to say the least | I am really shocked over all the issues with a 40K car and to make matters worse Lexus Corporate has not responded to my concerns and the dealer has stated this is the best we can do | I hope they will resolve but I am doubtful now | 
 "words": Bought my IS 250 because of great exterior looks although it is starting to look a lot like a 4 door Scion to me now | Inside has tighter width than other cars in its price range and there is not much leg room in the back especially with the drivetrain hump | There's only a single cup holder on console and it is only large enough for a dixie cup | No place to put wallet or BlackBerry either | Why have an ash tray no one would want to ruin the interior with cigarette smoke | Brake dust is more than an annoyance impossible to keep wheels clean | Underpowered | Honeymoon over | My lust for exterior went away when I sat inside and could only see flaws | I will be trading this car in soon | 
 "words": I've had Lexus products in the past with no rattle issues however my IS 250 has been in the shop 21 days with 3 unsuccessful repairs regarding 6 squeaks and rattles with a car having fewer than 3000 miles | Both left and right air vents rattle | Cheap trim around NAV GPS squeaks pops when ambient temperatures are above 80F 27C | Rattles in doors | Rattle in rear deck area | Moonroof rattle | 
 "words": The car is fun to drive | Silky smooth engine | Acceleration is adequate and the car is a good daily driver | Nice stock audio system has iPod hook-up | AWD is yet to be tested in the real snow | Rear seats are extremely tight and are not suitable for adults | Seats do not fall down to expand the trunk but do have an opening for long items in the middle | Paint scratches and dings easily | any minor road rock will break it to the primer | Overall I am happy with the car | 
 "words": Coming from an A4 and BMW 328 not a really performance car it has great looks this is what sold me | I have the car for 2 weeks already and I'm thinking to trade-in and go back to BMW soon | Has no power and the noise of the engine is loud not to mention the rattling noise coming from the dash | Not really happy with this car | 
 "words": Edmond's reviews and ratings convinced me to look into IS 250 | Drove both BMW 328 and IS 250 and decided on IS 250 | Much better value for the money | It was 10-15 lower cost with more options | 328 did have more power but something I rarely need | I've had it for 2 months now and it's a fun car to drive | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle a little over two weeks now and I absolutely love it | So far I haven't had any major problems with it but it does gather a lot of brake dust | Other than that I just enjoy everything about it | The ride is smooth and the interior is super quiet you can hardly hear anything from the outside | Great vehicle overall | 
 "words": I own an IS 250 with some extras | I got the larger wheels and the upgraded interior but without the nav I know my way around town thank you very much | I get more looks in this car that my buddy in a Porsche | This is a truly beautiful car and it has top notch quality | Power luxury style and name brand all in a great price range with everything | You cannot beat this with a stick | This kills the BMW 3 Infiniti M3 and the Audi A4 | I drove them all and this car was hands above them all in nearly all aspects | Great job on the IS Lexus guys | 
 "words": Great overall | Love the style both inside and outside | Love the navigation system and the bluetooth | Smart access system with push button start is a great feature | Hearing some road noise but this should be expected with any sports car | Also you will feel the bumps on the road | 
 "words": The car has 2k miles and already had two problems | Loose air vent in the footwell area rattling and defective hand brake assembly | There are some minor interior squeaks here and there | AWD attributes to a poor cornering even with stiff suspension | On a good note the interior is very quiet and the engine is very smooth | Lots of luxury options for the money | 
 "words": All I can say is WOW | This is the best car in this price range period | The perforated leather air cooled heated seats are wonderful | My Birds Eye Maple trim is top notch | I have the X-Package and love it looks sharp and ride quality remains superior w greater performance | Very satisfied with all aspects of this car | If there is a weak area I haven't found it | 
 "words": Purchased this vehicle about a month ago and couldn't be happier | Had been driving a 2007 Honda CRV test drove a few Lexus models and decided I could not go back to my Honda | You don't even notice the so called lack of horsepower and adults can sit comfortably in the back seat | 
 "words": This car is fun to drive | The ride is smooth and quiet and I find it amusing when I use the horn and it does not sound loud because of the interior sound reducing qualities | Backup camera is great too as I live on a cul de sac and there are many kids that are playing | My wife and I have been on some road trips already and do not feel tired or achey when sitting for an extended period of time | Lexus logo that lights up blue on the door scuff plates is a fine touch as well | Overall interior refinement with the clean lines give it that final touch | 
 "words": Absolutely love this car | Purchased it on my birthday and I fell in love with it during the test drive | The leather seats are so super comfortable and having a rear back up camera is a major plus | The leather heated ventilated seats are also wonderful | A couple of things I don't like 1 not enough console space to store things and 2 the brake dust is ridiculous and it is impossible to keep the wheels clean | I would definitely recommend this car to anyone | It has great pick up and provides a very comfortable ride | The backseat isn't super roomy but it is functional | Would definitely buy it all over again | I love my Lexus | 
 "words": I drove the 325i G35 TL A4 and needless to say this car takes the cake | Luxurious fun to drive great interior insulation a semi can pass and you hardly hear it excellent sound and navi system cooling seats etc | Very user friendly car excellent workmanship and the red with tan interior gets the looks from all | Valet drivers park it in the front for you | I love this car | 
 "words": Great style performance and mileage for a 4-door sedan | Many luxury features and comforts | The BMW and Audi certainly have this car on pure performance | But if you are looking for a great mix of comfort and performance this Japanese designed car beats the utilitarian design of the German cars | Nicely priced | 
 "words": Driving this car is a pleasure | I had to get rid of an impractical sports car 2005 RX-8 6MT and needed true 4 doors more space and comfort and I got it without compromises | Yes the shifter is easy the Lexus doesn't make you work for a shift like the Infiniti G35 coupe 6MT did nor is it as precise as the RX-8 but it is more forgiving allowing you to focus on the road and enjoying the great interior rather than focusing on making the quick shift | Yes it could use more power but I like the thought of my suspension being able to handle anything the engine can throw at it | Great car in and out love the 6MT and love everything about it | Lexus has me sold for life | 
 "words": I just purchased the IS 250 and all I can say is I love it | I was used to more horsepower owned a 2005 Maxima and thought I would miss it but the ride in the IS 250 is so luxurious it makes up for it | The body style is beautiful and interior is equally as stylish | Best car in its class | 
 "words": I drove the G35x but I just couldn't get past the styling of the IS | The G35 greatly improved the interior materials but it still didn't compare to the Lexus | Great touches and features like interior lighting auto dimming of the nav at night tied to the dash lights and light sensor and not just a manual nav setting easy bluetooth buttery leather etc | 
 "words": Looked at the BMW and Audi and made the only decision after driving all | The Lexus is not only better equipped it's a luxury car in all aspects | The fact that it is backed by Japanese reliability and build quality nailed the South African BMW out of the equation | particularly as I am extremely fussy about my build quality | That left the A4 which is also a superbly built car but after driving all three and in particular drive both and I was left with no doubt the Lexus is superlative | I should say Germans be very scared | but it's obvious the horse has already bolted | 
 "words": I used to drive a mercedes C230 | I recently made a switch to the IS 250 Lexus | The car drives and handles excellent | The road noise was much less than the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 I drove | The interior is about as nice as I could find in the market and the car has not had any problems | It feels more like 240 horsepower even though it's rated less | It's very fun to drive | They really built a great car with the new IS | I'm never driving anything but a Lexus ever again | 
 "words": I've owned this car for over 4 months and love it | Don't buy this car if you need rear passenger space | This car is comfortable for driver and one passenger only | It has performance brake pads which make the brakes a little jumpy | 
 "words": At first we're hesitant to lean more towards a Japanese luxury car but when we test drove it my wife and I just looked at each other and said this is very comfy and the interior design is very classy | We say the overall design is great | 
 "words": I'm in Toronto | Had it just after BoxingDay | Great car indeed | But the reason why I went for Lexus was for quality and quiet rides | To my disappointment there's significant tire noise i got 225 45 17 Dunlops especially at highway speed | Bumpy rides add noise to interior | Got to turn up the stereo in order to enjoy my classical music | Hurts my ears at the end of trip | Faint squeaky noise from interior panels doors dash somewhere at rear | Very small armrest storage | Jumpy tranny in slow traffics at 1st 2nd gear it seemed confused | Thinking of trading it in with an ES 350 | Too bad | Sorry to say these negative things but they're facts | Should test drive it for a full day | 
 "words": I previously drove a Pontiac Bonneville top of the line with lots of room | The reduced space of the IS took some getting used to | however the quality ride handling looks and gas mileage make up for the car being smaller | I chose metallic red with black interior | The wood looks great with the black | I test drove the G35 325i and TL and the Lexus won in almost every category looks handling gas mileage comfort least ride noise and the list goes on | My advice is to be very careful not to scratch the hood since it's aluminum | I'm single and the reduced back seat room is no problem | My IS is always getting looks on and off the road | I highly recommend it | It's muscular sexy | 
 "words": I have owned my IS 250 AWD for about a month now | I thought I was compromising on performance when I made the practical move to go with the AWD of the 250 instead of the 350 | I have not been disappointed in my decision at all | The 250 has ample get up and go with great gas mileage | The handling is great as well not to mention all of the cool gadgets and sound system | I've been throughly pleased everytime I get behind the wheel | 
 "words": I was hesitant about this car after owning an SUV | it was rather small but once I began driving it I loved it | I was also skeptical since my last luxury car was a BMW 5-series but this car handles even better than my 528 and just a smooth a ride | It's been less than a month but so far so good | It looks great and definitely turns heads | 
 "words": Just purchased my Starfire Pearl in early March 2007 and it is beautiful | From the sleek lines down to the posh interior as nice as my husband's GS 300 | The nav system is a nice touch and the rear backup camera is a must have as this vehicle does have some blind spots | The ride is smooth for a sports car and I felt the car abolutely gildes on the highway | It gets lots of second looks as the front end has such a presence as it approaches | The sound system is excellent I love the iPod hook up | I have noticed the brake dust on the front wheels will be a continuous cleaning process but it is well worth it as this sports car is all luxury and pizazz | Love it | 
 "words": After having multiple Lexuses we choose this as the perfect car for our son as a graduation gift | The safety features are comforting for any parent of an 18 year old and the AWD was a necessity for the New England winter the car has proven to be amazingly competant in snow even compared to my GX 470 for so long as there is less than 5 or so inches | The ride and handling is on par with BMW and the maintenance or lack thereof is better than the similar contenders from BWM and Audi | The steering is not quite that of BMW but the car makes up for that in every other aspect | If you are considering anything from BMW Audi and especially Mercedes the IS 250 should be on your short list of contenders | 
 "words": This is by far the best car I have ever own or driven | IS stands for Intellegent Sport | And that is exactly what this car is | It is the most sophisticated sport car out there for under 35K | Also IS has the highest safety rating of its class | That data was provided by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA | If you just want a car for how it handles and speed then I recommend the IS 350 or BMW 330 for 40K | But If you like all the options and great gas mileage 32 hwy mpg then this car is you | 
 "words": Not quite a sports car and not quite a luxury car and not quite a family sedan but it has a little of each more luxury and more sports it has a refined look that takes you where you want to go in style with a sporty flare | 
 "words": This is my 2nd IS had '03 IS 300 and I love it even more than my old one | The new IS feels much much more expensive than my last one and definitely more luxurious than other cars in its class | I think the car is gorgeous and it stands out from all the boring cars on the road | I got mine a week ago in silver w black interior and have already recieved so many compliments on the car | I especially love driving the car at night with the HID headlights and the Optitron gauges glowing that cool blue color | Lexus really went to bat with this one and I couldn't be more pleased | If I had more money I would've sprung for the 350 but I can't say that I'm really missing the extra horsepower 
 "words": Bold | People can't take their eyes off of it | Awesome car | Great interior | nav is a must | gas mileage is solid | 
 "words": This is my first Lexus and what an impression it has made on me and everyone who has driven in it with me | Gorgeous car inside and out a very smooth ride and gets a lot of looks | Lots of great standard features keyless entry leather seats moonroof auxilary port for iPod etc | As expected the obisidian black exterior is difficult to keep clean but there's nothing like it after a wash and wax | If you want something lower-maintenance in that area go for the Tungsten Pearl or Starfire Pearl | This car looks hot in any color | I opted for the 250 over the 350 for better gas mileage | Test drove the 350 though and what a fun ride | 
 "words": Switched from driving an A4 Quattro to this fun car | Love the drive love the ride it is so smooth | The only down side is the navigation system cannot be controlled while in motion most annoying if you have a passenger who can use it while you drive | It also lacks the abilty to announce street names like some stand alone units | The other down side is the rear seat does not fold down | The car is without doubt in a class of its own despite these minor anoyances | The finish is excellent and the attention to detail is fantastic | This car is loaded and drives like a dream | Try one and see | 
 "words": I've owned my IS 250 for 3 months and now really appreciate its qualities | Thought the car a little boring at first especially compared to my wife's BMW 325 convertible | No doubt the 325 is more responsive in all respects but especially the steering response | The IS 250 is way too light and can be a little difficult on all but the smoothest of surfaces | As far as everything else is concerned it's no contest | Gas mileage on the Lexus is far superior a recent 700 mile round trip from Sarasota to Key West resulted in 35 | 5 mpg | The overall mpg over 2200 miles of ownership is 30 | 5 mpg | The IS 250 has the looks to turn heads | 
 "words": Just got the car a couple of days ago and already love it | It's got enough power and with AWD it really hugs the road | Got the lux pack and nav sys and the bluetooth works great with my cell phone | 
 "words": My wife chose this car but I find myself driving it every chance I get | This is the first car I own that I plan to keep for as long as I drive | Fit finish are excellent features and conveniences are very well thought out | Handling is sharp and precise | Suspension lets you feel the road but the cabin is ultra quiet | It truly is the best of both worlds | 
 "words": In the market for a entry level performance car | Close call between the Lexus IS 250 and the BMW 328i | Quality and value finally convinced me to go with the Lexus | It has been a fun experience so far | 
 "words": This is my first Lexus and while it's the bottom of the range the attention to detail is clearly evident in the design of this vehicle | The Black Sapphire is a beautiful color the fit and function is wonderful and the drive is tight and responsive without being dangerously fast like the IS 350 | Chose the IS 250 over the IS 350 because I couldn't afford the speeding tickets and for the gas mileage | I'm getting about 18 mpg in SF city driving | 
 "words": I live in the metro New York area and usually am in the car by myself | We have one child who is 7 years old | My wife and I are both under 5'8 tall | I think the Lexus cannot be beaten for the money | It handles very well although I have not had the opportunity to test it in the snow and handles much better in the rain than my 2002 Audi A4 did | The conveniences in the car are wonderful and a BMW with a comparable feature set was about 20 more | We live in a very hilly area I spend less than 1 2 of my time on highways and we are getting about 24 MPG overall | This is similar to what I got on my Audi A4 | 
 "words": This car is great | Lexus has everything down to the finest detail the turn signal has grooves for your fingers | The fit and finish is perfect | Pricing is better than competition | The leather is super soft and the seats are extremely comfortable | Interior noise is negligible and the Mark L | sound system is awesome | If you're planning to buy a bimmer or c class you owe it to yourself to test drive this car | 
 "words": Several months ago I went on a massive hunt for a 4 door 4 wheel drive car priced under 35000 | My candidates are as follows Lincoln MKZ Mercury Milan BMW 3 xi Audi A4 Quatro Jaguar X-Type | I am very pleased with my choice of the Lexus IS250 AWD a loaded base car that looks and feels fantastic | The V6 mated to a 6 speed auto with paddle shifters purrs like a kitten | It's quite capable on the highway and corners as if on rails | 
 "words": From the first test on the IS 250 I was sold on the silky tramsmission fit and finish and quiet engine | I have had this car for less than a week and can not be more pleased | The power is a 204 HP so it is not going to jump off the line but it is ample on the highway and remember it is that lowered HP that is more than making up at the pump | The rear seat is small everyone comments on that but since I am single and rarely have passengers it is not a big deal for me | 
 "words": IS 250 AWD great ride | Hugs the road | Great acceleration | It doesn't feel like you're driving a toy | I purchased mine fully loaded | 
 "words": This car is great for 2 people back seat space is tight but I'LL never be in the back seat | I got it for my wife who had the ES 300 | We love the IS because of the smaller size sharper look and the car handles better than the ES 300 | The ride is not as smooth as a smaller wheel base but it's so much more of a sports car its a keeper |
