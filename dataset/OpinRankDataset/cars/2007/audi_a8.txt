 "words": The Audi A8 Sport is one of the most aesthetically pleasing cars I have ever seen | The real surprise however is the combination of ride quiet and predictable handling in all conditions with high limits for a vehicle of this size and class | I expected competence but I was surprised by the fun to drive aspects of this car | The longer I have owned the vehicle the better it gets | I drove the MB Jaguar BMW and Lexus there was no question before I purchased the car which one I preferred but I am even more convinced now that I have more than 14000 miles on the vehicle and continue to explore its capabilities | I hope Audi doesn't change much before I am ready for my next one | 
 "words": The A8 never fails to amaze us | On a recent vacation we drove 700 miles north and on the way the kids never asked Are we there yet | once | The car is so relaxing to travel in and makes any journey comfortable | The gas mileage is equally impressive on our vacation we averaged 28 mpg and drove most of the way at 80 mph | The 350hp direct injection 4 | 2L V8 has immediate power and even more refinement | The MMI is easy to use and just makes sense | We looked at the Lexus LS460 but it felt big heavy and was worse to drive than the old LS430 | the Lexus had too many features and had millions of buttons | The 2007 BMW 750i had the stupid I-drive and the S550 was too expensive | The A8 is brilliant |

 "words": This car represents the perfect blend between luxury accomodations and sporty performance | While other luxury cars S550 BMW750 lS460seem to be good in some areas and weak in others the A8 is excellent in every single area and weak in none | The ride is superb design flawless and the handling is simply amazing extremely nimble for a large car | The attention to detail is impeccable everywhere you look and the ergonomics is simply fantastic | The interior will put anything south of 200K to shame | These days I find myself running more errands | I wonder why | 
 "words": My black on black A8L is built like a bank vault is quiet except when accelerating when it has a nice little throaty tone | I've had an A6 2 | 7 which was fun | still have an A6 4 | 2 2002 which is still solid and fun to drive | I had a 2006 A8L which was great but the 07 car is even better | It is understated sumptuous quick and solid | Everything one could want | 
 "words": I have owned Jags Mercs BMW and Cadillacs and they all have their outstanding features | The regal look of the Jag the comfort of the Merc and the Cadi's smooth ride | The Audi L W12 my first took the best features of luxury automobiles in its class and built a car that has lived up to my expectations | Yes the car has a six figure price tag fully loaded | however the car delivers on all its promises and gives the driver a senseof royalty without being to flashy | Would it be fair to say that I am an Audi man for life | YES | 
 "words": This is my third Audi and I find them to be a superb balance between a luxury and sporty design philosophy | The vehicle feels like a smaller more nimble vehicle but has more room than practically anything else in this segment | The interior design and fit and finish are best in class | The S8 variant is an attractive alternative but we also had a sporty car in the garage and decided to go with the long wheel base and the extra rear leg room which precludes the S8 package | But I also feel the extra length gives the car a more flowing appearance in the side view | Fuel economy is what you expect in this class and when considering the performance and the way I drive it is rather good | 
 "words": I looked at all the luxury models in this class this car can't be touched for the money you pay | It's all I expected and more |

 "words": The Audi A8L is the perfect vehicle for me | I drive about 50k miles per year between North Carolina and northern VA DC and it can get very tiring in the wrong kind of car | The Audi is fun to drive and is very quiet and comfortable | The quattro drive is great when there are some icy conditions on the VA highways | The bluetooth connection with my phone works superbly and keeps my attention on the road while driving | The rear camera and front and rear parking sensors are very handy when parking and backing out of crowded parking garages | The rear seat area is very spacious and will seat 3 | The rear leg and shoulder room is unbelievable | I can easily fit my 2 biggest clients back there | 
 "words": I bought this car in October last year | after three months I have yet to find a thing that I don | t like it took me no time to get used to the mmi and the voice command is very responsive | I got the black black in and out which shows the crafty style and quality more apparent | I like the A8 that much | Now I am dreaming the S8 | 
 "words": This car is beautiful inside and out | It feels classy rather than flashy | We just had a major snowstorm here in Seattle and while everyone else including lots of 4wd SUVs skidded off the road I drove right home | 
 "words": Purchased in Sept 2006 | Third Audi I've bought in past 4 years | A6 2 | 7T and A6 4 | 2 and now this A8L | I still have the A6 4 | 2 which is 4 yrs old and in top shape with 54000 miles on it | No problems | The new A8 is rock solid and just as peppy as the A6 | Interior is absolutely top quality | MMI is a bit daunting for me but I am working through it | Never had one before | I think the side mirrors could be a bit larger but I love everything else including the massage seats and front and back radar for parking | I will buy another in 3 or 4 years | 
 "words": I just picked up my A8L 4 | 2 V8 2 weeks ago and it is THE most luxurious car I've ever owned | The attention to detail of the interior leather and wood is sheer perfection | The drive is amazingly smooth but as precise as a surgeons scalpel | I can't believe that a large luxury car like this handles so well | Not to mention the all wheel drive gives me a feeling of confidence on the road that is a true benefit | Mine is Black with Amaretto Leather and the B O stereo | The rear seat room is amazing and my girls love the power rear seats |

 "words": I purchased my A8 on 11 04 06 | This is not the long wheelbase model but the shorter A8 | If my dealer told me the truth this the only A8 in the Audi Central Region with the 20 Sport Package | The car is not only a knock out in looks but a blast to drive | Great performance plus all the luxury you could ever want | I traded in a 2006 Infiniti M45 Sport so you know I had to go some to find a better vehicle | Audi needs to advertise this model more |
