 "words": This is my second 300C after trading in a 2005 RWD | The first one was an early build first model year and it had several small annoyances some of which were fixed under warranty | The 2007 has been problem-free | AWD is great in a car like this you can take off in any weather with no wheel hop | not that RWD was unusable in snow but the OEM Continental tires that wore out in 10K miles were the real culprit | Your mileage may vary but it can honestly get 25mpg with the car loaded and the A C on in hilly terrain | 
 "words": This is one of the most classically designed reasonably priced vehicles on the road today | Chrysler 300C needs about a 30 Improvement in interior rear traction Imperfections to be the best model on the market in its category | Most serious problem with Model 300C Non-Four Wheel Drive is a Serious Lack of Rear Traction in Snow |

 "words": The only major complaint I would have with the Chrysler 300 is the thunk you feel when you slowly take off from a light and you hear a hard thunk as though someone has hit you from the rear | The thunk sound also occurs when you are trying to reverse the vehicle | The Salesman along with Chrysler repair man says that Chrysler is aware of the thunk sound and that is has something to do with the Tranny and since the car has 3 computerized components each components has different functions and they are playing catch up to each other when you hear that slight thunk |
