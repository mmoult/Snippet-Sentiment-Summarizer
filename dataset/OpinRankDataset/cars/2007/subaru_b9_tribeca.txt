REVIEWS
 "words": We got this car with 580000 miles on it | We have had three other subies and loved them all | Our son loves it and calls it the spaceship car he is five years old | we travel often and love this car | We had a chevy uplander before and it was JUNK and not four wheel drive | I highly recommend this car to anyone and know a lot of people that have them and love them | 
 "words": It's been a year since I wrote a review on my B7 Tribeca | It now has roughly 21000 miles and I'm still very glad I purchased it | My wife loved driving it in the snow this past winter | Only minor complaints are 1 | I have to stay on top of the service mgr at the dealership when it's in | which fortunately isn't often and 2 | rusty brake calipers | 
 "words": The editors review indicated less than good acceleration for the B9 Tribeca and I must say I disagree strongly | My B9 has great acceleration entering and on the highway | It will jump out from under you if you require it | Super highway car | 
 "words": Before I bought this car I read lots of negative things about exterior design in on-line reviews | Honestly I believe its high tech exterior looks much better than the 2008 model and is totally different from other SUVs | I love it | Interior is amazing and built of excellent material | Driving is smooth as luxury sedan compare to many other SUVs such as Murano that gives you the impression of driving a truck rather than a car | Car is stable and powerful | Like other SUVs It is not good on gas | I enjoy driving it very much so far and everybody loves it | I couldn | t find people who hate the design yet and I am still looking for | 
 "words": Traded in a late model Nissan and bought a year-old Tribeca with 9000 miles on it | This vehicle is a diamond in the rough | An unbelievable value for what I got | The Limited trim line with the mesh grille and big chrome wheels really set this vehicle apart from the rest of the pack | Overall fit and finish is sexy and superb | Excellent handling and responsive boxer 6 cyl engine give a sense of confidence | This is the first Subaru I have owned but have family members who've owned several Outbacks and a Legacy GT and I can see why they rave about this often over- looked brand | I wonder what Subaru's service dept is like hopefully better than Nissan's | 
 "words": We absolutely luv to drive our Tribeca | Have taken on two long trips and will not give up the wheel | Visually styling is distinct and pleasing | Interior cockpit feels young and vibrant | Exterior side and rear view especially is downright cool | No issues thus far in 16K miles except Nav system freeze up but replaced immediatly | Mechanically sound as Lexus or Acura | 
 "words": Love the looks and the design the best | Drive is nice on highway but bumpy on urban streets | I have had a lot of rattles and they appear to be with the rear seat and the rear hatch | Dealer can't seem to get it right | Otherwise all of the features of the car are great | Would be very happy but for the bumps and rattles | Subaru should offer standard features on certain trim levels | When buying this car it seems like I could never find the same model with the exactly the same features twice | 
 "words": I traded in my 2003 Legacy Outback Limited for the Tribeca as soon as it came off the production line | It is so much fun to drive | It is also my very first automatic | I wasn't sure I would like an automatic so I decided to lease it | Well here it is almost three years later and I am still smitten | I was so disappointed when they changed the front in the 2008 model | That is what made it so unique | And that is why I will most likely purchase this at lease end | I am going to check out the new Forester and then make my final decision | I am looking for a car to own for the next 10 years | Every time we have to climb a steep hill in the snow we sing the Spiderman theme | 
 "words": Researched and drove every SUV around 35K and nothing excited me like a Tribeca | Interior is stunning | Used price is unbeatable | Drives just fine despite negative reviews in the media | Alfa Romero inspired front end will grow on you | Created an emotional connection for me that was completely lacking in an explorer edge highlander pilot crv or virtually anthing else | Also embraced the wisdom of buying used instead of new with 2 young children in the house | 
 "words": I bought this car after totaling my 2003 Honda Element and I couldn't be happier | I have never owned a Subaru before and the Tribeca is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned | I have owned many makes of cars including Audis Saabs Volvos and Volkswagens | This vehicle tops all of them except two of the Volvos | The comfort and performance is great and the price point for the features was excellent | 
 "words": This is my second Subaru | I had a Ltd Legacy over 100000 on it and traded it for a fuel efficient Honda Civic | My daughter now owns that with its 109000 miles and many more to go | The Tribeca is my first sport luxury car | I drove 5 cars that day and once I drove the Tribeca that was it I couldn't go back to the others | I never want to rush somewhere I just want to be in the car and mosey along | Do I mind a stoplight | Not at all | Just turn up the awesome speaker system | I sat in the third row | no problem for me I'm 5'5 | 
 "words": We bought it about 3 weeks ago it has been great so far | I was a little worried about the sluggish pick up but it really has not been a big deal | The car runs great all the extras are awesome | I really love the puddle lights | It's my wife's car and it's the type of car that makes me feel good that she is safe | 
 "words": With the 3rd and 4th seats folded down flat there is room to pack a kid back to college | Has nice power and is sporty | 
 "words": Great SUV | Very smooth drive handles very well on curves | Great turning radius | Good power not great but good | Very spacious second row third row is not bad at all | 
 "words": Very nice SUV | Well designed | very comfortable interior and ride | Exterior look of '07 is an eyecatcher disappointed Subaru changed '08 exterior but I guess makes my '07 all the more special | Gas mileage no surprise good or bad | A couple of design materials issues but dealer fixed with no problem | 
 "words": We looked and test drove just about every style of SUV | It came down to the new LR2 Land Rover or the Tribeca the last one we test drove | I've owned Porsche Corvette BMW Acura Toyota just to name a few | The interior and exterior of the Tribeca have excellent fit and finish | The ride is very stable and secure feeling | The standard and optional features are wonderful | We wanted an SUV that was going to be a keeper for the next 10 years and we found it | The power is satisfying and adequate for normal everday use | The style isn't ugly its unique and exotic and it didn't take long to grow on us | We wouldn't have been happy with anything else | The new style looks like all the others | 
 "words": I suppose I could talk about how slow the car feels the so-so ride quality the hard seats and the subpar audio system although it does read MP3 discs | but that's been said | I'd like to talk about how this car saved my life | While driving in the winter in Minnesota doing about 55 mph the road suddenly changed from plowed to about 9 inches of snow | As the car begins to slide out of control I give it full left but the steering is unresponsive as are the brakes | As I'm about to hit a parked car doing 55 I remember than in an AWD vehicle you must gently apply gas to recover | Voila | AWD saved me from what would have been a horrendous accident | Slow | Who cares | 
 "words": We ended up buying the Tribeca unexpectedly due to another car being totaled | I've never owned a Subaru and it wasn't even on the radar when we started shopping but their 2750 incentive couldn't be beat | With about 2000 miles so far I am very pleased | What sold me most was the wonderful interior well-appointed with quality materials and a stylish dash design | Very upscale | The engine isn't as bad as some say | Power while not thrilling is certainly adequate | Great highway ride quiet and smooth | The exterior design really grows on you as well | I probably see 50 Highlanders or Muranos for every Tribeca on the road | I like that it stands out from the SUV crowd | Well done Subaru | 
 "words": I love my SUV I cannot believe I was able to afford such a luxurious vehicle | The design inside and out is so extremely comfortable and breath taking | This vehicle has everything and more than I could have ever wanted | It drives like a champ especially in the Miami FL rain | FYI I would not change the locking system because if you ever were to go into a canal you don't want those doors locking automatically | 
 "words": I think overall the Tribeca is an excellent crossover | This is our first Subaru coming from a Toyota Camry then Honda Accord | I feel that the Subaru competes very well in that crowd | Some don't like the exterior styling but I think it sets the Tribeca apart from the crowd | We get looks from people walking down the street all the time | 
 "words": The 3 | 0 in this vehicle is horrible | It's a pig to put it bluntly | I'm getting rid of this vehicle with 7500 miles | I'm sick of it and it's lack of power | 
 "words": Comfortable in control feeling all of the time | Hardly any lean in the corners seems bigger than it actually is | 
 "words": I came out of a 2003 Outback LL Bean Edition | I thought the B9 would be too big and clunky that is until I drove it | It took a few minutes to decide but I chose the B9 because it was a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": Overall a good car | Not very roomy in back | 3rd row for small children only | Handling ability in snow is fantastic | However I only have 2200 miles on this car have had it in the dealer twice replacing the wiper blades and then replaced the whole wiper | The wipers DO NOT clear during snow | There is significant build up on the passenger side especially | To me totally defeats the purpose of having an AWD vehicle if you can't see when you drive the darn thing | 
 "words": Not as fun to drive as the manual shift Outback | Slow to get going from a stop and noisy engine rev makes it seem like an effort for the car to get going | Compared to my 11 year old Outback which has zippy pick-up with only four cylinders this six cylinder car has the perfomance of a dinosaur | Nice interior styling though but everything is electronic including odometer | Gas hog | 
 "words": This was my first Subaru | We got this vehicle because of ist outstanding safety ratings | Only 6k miles so far it's been all good | The front end exterior is different but it grows on you quickly | The interior is just great | Rear seats are on sliders like front seats it makes for plenty of room even taller people | The AWD and vehicle stability control features make it sure footed in the northern winters | I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone | 
 "words": The engine is very responsive | the ride is very soft and comfortable | I can feel the traction cruising at curves | 
 "words": One month 1800 miles after purchase I am happy with my first SUV | After 2 Legacies in 17 years I had no doubts about Subaru quality | Our lifestyle now said more room so I test drove other brands to see what whistles and bells were out there | It compares very well in that regard | The tight turn radius is a pleasant surprise | The acceleration is there when needed | The ride is a little bit stiffer than our other car Avalon | I'm getting 21 MPG in mixed city and freeway driving on regular gas | The instrument panel and controls are easy to get used to | The seats are comfortable | I feel like I'm in a cockpit | 
 "words":  B9 Tribeca is not getting the fair review as it should properly be compared to other foreign cars | The exterior and interior designs are fairly comparable to the luxury brands of Toyota Honda and Nissan | You take a look at the safety features of the car you will be surprise its even better than those big 3 imports | I am enjoying my B9 Tribeca in terms of its luxury appointment and the price that I have paid | Try test driving one and compare it | 
 "words": I recently purchased this car so I don't have many miles on it yet | My first impressions are it has a very nice build-quality perfect for the family and the AWD all-wheel-drive is spectacular | I previously owned a BMW 528 and going to a cross-over like the Tribeca was easy | 
 "words": Only have a few thousand miles on it but it's everything it's built up to be | 
 "words": Good safe vehicle for my wife | Full time AWD stability control heated everything | good winter vehicle | Comes with all the bells and whistles for a very reasonable price maybe because they aren't exactly flying off the lots | The mileage isn't too miserable either 20ish | Plus we LIKE the look of the vehicle | 
 "words": This is my first Subaru and I bought it based on its safety ratings the recommendations of friends and on my own long-standing perception of Subaru as an Innovator | Nice car nice looking but Subaru is falling short on the details | The 2000 plus 2007 navigation system is shipping with a 2- year old 2005 vintage map CD | The companion audio system doesn't display title artist station information from CD player or radio on that big color screen like other cars in its class | It is also loud in the passenger cabin | 
 "words": It's certainly the one of a kind SUV powerful solid luxury fun to drive | Looking for a premium quality SUV for some time I was initially interested in ACURA RDX and test drove that many times | RDX besides pricey turned out to be too small compared to Tribeca especially the tight back seat and small cargo area | it's also way too noisy when speeding up from low speed | Tribeca on the other hand feels more solid when turning smoother speeding up | Some people complained about the gas mileage | I'm getting 21 | 5 to 23 | 9 mi gal combined local and highway in the DC area | For an SUV this size with AWD I'm happy | Sport shift is certainly helpful to gain speedy pass when needed-easy to use | 
 "words": This was my first Subaru | got this vehicle for my wife because of the safety aspects but we both love it | This is a luxury vehicle at an affordable price | I can't recommend it enough | Good low end torque with a little less response on the highway | Corners without leaning haven't had a chance to put the AWD to test | Interior is top-notch and very comfortable including for back seat passengers | 3rd row is a joke which is why we purchased the 5 passenger version | We chose this over X3 Murano Highland CR-V and CX-7 | 
 "words": We previously owned a Forester for 9 years and found it getting a little small for us esp | in the rear seat | So we got a great deal on a Tribeca and love it | We won't use the 3rd row much but it's nice to have the option | The rear seat is very roomy with the seat moved all the way back some don't know there is a second lever for sliding back more | The nav is very good once you figure it out watch the video it comes with | Handles very well for its size and has enough power especially compared to the Forester | It gets lots of looks and everyone says it looks much better first hand vs seeing pictures | 
 "words": Sleek exterior and diamond gray color is awesome | Front grill is toned down with less chrome | Interior ergo is good and quality is up there with European cars | Ride is comfortable yet firm enough to handle twisties easily | Quiet ride as well | Brakes good | Could use a bit more power but adequate for an SUV | Honda Pilot a bit roomier since it's a box but after test driving both you'll take the Tribeca for everything else it offers that the Pilot doesn't | 
 "words": I've had my new '07 Tribeca for a month now and I absolutely love it | I shopped the Nissan Murano and Lexus RX330 but ultimately had to go with the Tribeca | It's got a 3rd row which fits adults comfortably despite some reviews I read which neither Nissan nor Lexus even offer | Plus I could get leather dvd back-up camera and nav for thousands less than the Murano or RX330 | This car is fun to drive it has plenty of power | The only downside is the gas mileage has been awful I'm averaging 16 mpg with a mix of highway and around town with air on it's been hot | Plus the tank only holds 16 gallons so fill-ups are frequent | Overall this car looks and feels very luxurious | 
 "words": This vehicle was purchased for my wife | She wanted an SUV that wasn't too big wasn't too small wasn't the same as everyone else and had lots of features | We test drove everything 17 in total from 25K to over 70K | We liked the Porsche Cayenne S but didn't feel like spending that much | We also liked the Lexus RX350 but everyone has one | The Subaru B9 Tribeca was the last one we tested and we only tried it because the Porsche and Audi dealer also sold Subaru | We liked it so much and the dealer gave us a very good deal on a just off the truck 2007 model that we bought it that day | We have taken it on two long road trips and love it | 
 "words": Best vehicle I have ever owned | Rides smooth and the interior never fails to impress | AWD is superior and the build quality is second to none | For the price the Lexus and Acura can't touch the B9 | So far two friends about to buy Pilots even had deals together bought B9s after test driving them at my suggestion | It certainly is worth a look for anyone in the luxury or near luxury SUV market | 
 "words": We love this car | This is our 4th Subaru and the biggest they make | we have the WRX and the Baja and this make a great safe and fun car |
