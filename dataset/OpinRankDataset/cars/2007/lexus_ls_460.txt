REVIEWS
 "words": Purchased a 2007 LS460L last week with 13000 miles | Bought it online from out of town dealer | My first Lexus | Beautiful in most all aspects except for noticeable wind noise at highway speeds | For a car company with Lexus' reputation I found this disturbing | The local dealership was very aware of the problem replaced both front windows and reseated the rear view mirrors | Now I hear wind noise only when I drive at 100 mph | Seriously | Yes I know I shouldn't drive that fast but how do you otherwise pass someone who's only doing 85 | In any event the problem was solved I am very pleased and cannot keep the smile off my face when behind the wheel of this luxurious beauty | 
 "words": I have owned 5 Lexus | 1st was 1990 | The best was last model of the 430 | The new model has the following flaws 1 Seat comfort is not the same as previous | 2 The rear view window is not large enough an one suffers from not having the same visibility as previous models | 3 The trunk is smaller due to the larger indented wheel wells that result in loss of space | 4 The design doesn't say distinctive or luxury | instead it says this is a pregnant Camry | 
 "words": This is a good reliable car with some nice bells and whistles but I would never call it a Premier Luxury car | It is one of the noisest cars I have ever owned and with its price tag and rave reviews about how quiet the car is I expected a lot more | The wind noise is terrible | It sounds like the window is cracked when driving at 55 or greater | Lexus insulated the roof posts and replaced side windows with insulated glass but it helped very little | Very annoying and it makes me cringe when I think about what I paid for it | Also an annoying rattle the dealer is trying to correct with little luck so far | Also very expensive to maintain | 200 | 00 for an oil change and tire rotation | 
 "words": This is my fifth Lexus LS | I enjoyed my 2001 LS 430 more than this one based on what appears to be an unresolvable wind noise | The car had the fix and although the noise is not as harsh it is still very noticeable in certain wind conditions or speeds | Also notice what I would call a ticking from the engine at idle and was told that it is normal for this car | My 2001 was much quieter and more comfortable as I also find the front seats to be less than perfect as it applies to being comfortable | Still would consider owning another Lexus but intend to see what Lexus does about truly fixing this problem | Not happy about spending this kind of money and still hearing wind noise | 
 "words": The wind noise is still very excessive on the passenger side after Lexus installed the fix for the issue November 2007 | 10 out of 10 passengers in my car thinks the windows are not closed tightly | The wind noise is not acceptable to me for such an expensive car | This car is supposed to be quiet | Lexus still claims that | My experience with this car and Lexus customer service has been big dissapointment to me | 
 "words": Still have my 2001 LS 430 just had to have the LS 460 great power good gas mileage | I don't understand people complaining about the seats I love them | My 430 has the electronic speed control it's a pain on the interstate so didn't get it on the 460 | 
 "words": The car is almost perfect except for wind noise | For 85000 this really bugs me and Lexus has not got a cure as of Feb 2008 | Can you believe that | Very disappointed owner | 
 "words": I've driven Mercedes BMW and Audi for forty years and this is my first Japanese vehicle | I love it | It's fast smooth quiet and unexciting | Perfect for lawn bowling and AARP meetings | Mushy suspension and unresponsive steering unlike the German cars | Minimum service unlike the German cars | Windshild wipers which work properly | Heating and cooling which work properly | Multiple electronics which all work properly | I love this car | 
 "words": This is my 2nd LS | My 1991 LS 400 lasted 16 years 350K miles | My 460L Exec Class has 4 seats including the recliner with ottoman and massage | It also came with the nav system Mark Levinson sound DVD drop down screen | My brother-in-law was in the recliner watching a movie through the wireless headset and getting a Shiatsu massage said I needed to have a chauffeur's hat | Many more electronic controls than my old LS but they are laid out in a simple way and pretty intuitive though reading the encyclopedic manual is very useful | Wind noise issue seems solved for the later built cars mine was built in 7 07 but test drive the car you are buying | 
 "words": Purchased car in September 2007 | Test drove BMW 750i and decided to buy LS 460 due to reliability track record | The car is a great improvement over LS 430 in most categories | The interior design is more sporty and not just for older crowd | Exterior design is sporty but blends in with smaller Lexus sedans too easily | The seats are not very supportive in hard turns but comfortable | Rear seats with power recline and ventilation are very comfortable | The suspension is far better then previous LS 430 | One major flaw is wind noise from both front windows | Just like every one else waiting for dealer to get parts as per Lexus bulletin | I seriously hope that this will fix the noise issue | 
 "words": Great car | Fantastic integration of electronics with touch screen navigation screen | Much more user freindly then previous LS 430 | Great sound system but it you crank up the volume at low base the rear windo glass starts vibrating | One big problem is the wind noise at highway cruising speed LS 430 was superior in sound isolation | Front seats not as comfortable as LS 430 | Took away the motorized air vents not so happy about that | Ride is more sporty and transmission is flawless | 
 "words": Although I would like to own an American car I had to give up my Cadillac for this one | Originally looked at the 430 in 2006 | Glad I waited for the 460 | After much research I think I made the best choice | Was recently advised that there is a service bulletin for interior wind noise | Dealer once approved after tech ride along will replace weatherstrip install thicker glass and additional insulation | My parts are on order | Hope the fix works | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle but with one real problem and a few minor problems | A couple of months after owning the car both my wife and I started to notice that the front seats were becoming less comfortable | It feels like there is a bar across the back of the seat and down the middle | There's no way I could drive the car for some hours | My Lexus dealer says this is normal stretching | Very limited access to the navigation system while moving is a pain | There is an annoying tick from the engine compartment at idle which the dealer says is normal | Wind noise is present at above 45 MPH | 
 "words": This is the perfect car | Beautifully styled luxuriously outfitted strong performance and incredible finish and reliability | I have owned 10 Lexuses including the previous generation LS 430 but this one is the pinnacle of perfection | The worries and stress drain from me when I sit behind the wheel glance at the elegant wood trim tune the Mark Levinson stereo and sink into the cushioned leather of the most comfortable driver's seat in autodom | The interior is whisper quiet with a faint engine noise as the car effortlessly accelerates to freeway speed | I am in heaven | 
 "words": I've owned the car for a month and a half now and the Lexus lockout of much of the navigation phone and even audio functions while the car is in motion is a major issue had Lexus been honest and forthright about this in their sales literature and through their dealership I would have not purchased the vehicle | Overall the car rides nice but a bit insulated | My previous car a 2006 750li handles better provides better tactile road feel has far more comfortable and adjustable seats and with its active suspensions corners mush better than the LS | I do like the exterior styling of the LS better
 "words": I bought this vehicle based upon build quality style and value | I should have paid more attention to comfort and convenience | Both front seats are uncomfortable due to a support in the center of seat bottom which I did not notice during my test drive | As I drive 35000 miles a year new destinations are common place | The guidance system limits programming to voice commands once the vehicle is in motion though the system can be programmed via voice instruction this to limit distraction to the driver | However the voice recognition system leaves much to be desired | The reality is there are enough selections on the display screen to make this idea laughable | Let the driver drive | 
 "words": A luxurious top quality driving machine that surpasses Mercedes and BMW easily | I had a 2006 S500 and 2007 S550 | They don't compare in quality to this car and the Lexus costs less | All the special features spoil you easy to use navigation park assist superb ride quietness inside ability to change driving mode to either Normal Comfort Sport | Wow that makes it so fun | 
 "words": This is my third LS previously had 1990 and 1998 models | I'm on the fence with this one | On the one hand I love the vehicle's safety features the interior the gadgets and the acceleration | On the other hand the vehicle came with several problems wind noise hesitation at start wing mirrors that did not unfold when they should and locks that did not automatically lock when they should | All these issues have been resolved but they left me concerned | There's too much road noise the tires need to be upgraded to Michelin SP2 or equivalent | The engine sounds a little rough when accelerating | 
 "words": We are a Lexus family with currently an LX and a GS | We were ready to add a large sedan and spent an ample amount of time driving the BMW 745LI Mercedes S550 and of course the LS 460L | Although the S550 is an extremely nice auto I'm very pleased to have saved 15k-20k and stayed with Lexus | This is by far the nicest automobile I have been in and is an absolute pleasure to drive | I thought the LX wouldn't never be replaced as my favorite auto but neither it nor the GS has been out of the garage since the LS came home | Forget about the negative auto park reviews that's not why you buy this Lexus | 
 "words": I have never driven a nicer car in my life time | It is so perfect I don't know how they can keep up with the production of such a fine automobile | Everything about the car is quality | I don't know what they could do to make it any better that is why I say that it is a little bit better than outstanding | 
 "words": I drove my LS 460L on two long trips one 1200 miles the other 4300 miles | The car was flawless | Using radar cruise MPG was as high as 30 | 1 and no lower than 26 | 7 in a very strong headwind | With a 22 | 2 gallon tank the range is terrific and after driving long stretches there was very little driver fatigue | This is my fourth Lexus and the only car of the four that was perfect right off the lot | Having recently owned competitor | s cars I think this is the very best value on the market today | I drove the LS 460L Mercedes 550 and BMW 750 back to back | When driving each car I couldn | t find enough of a driver experiene difference so my decision came down to features and the Lexus won | 
 "words": Once again Lexus exceeds the offerings from German manufacturers | After the numerous problems I have had with German cars it is comforting to have a car which is so smooth well built and reliable | It would have been nice if the exterior design was a little more exciting but I suppose at this level cars need to be more sophisticated than fashionable | I wish I had spent more time with the dealer at the time of purchase so he could talk me through the numerous features | He did offer to demonstrate everything but I thought I would work it all out myself wrong | The instruction book is a little complicated to follow with so many features and variations within the model range | 
 "words": I guess it is needless to mention all the technological marvels that have been included in this vehicle | The 380 HP power plant paired with an 8 speed automatic transmission deliver the most pleasant luxury ride | The car comes pre-packaged in 4-5 trims | Unfortunately I could not get a laser-guided cruise control with pre-collision system since it is only offered on the top of the line LS460 L | I could not buy the longer version due to length limitation of my garage and the above feature is not normally installed on lower end models | Of course one could configure any combination of features but that is subject for a long wait since vehicle has to be special ordered in this case | 
 "words": The LS4 60 has a manufacturing defect that allows a very noticeable wind noise that emanates from the driver's side window | Lexus states that there is no fix | New buyers should carefully evaluate whether they want to spend 70000 for a car with noticeable and annoying wind noise | 
 "words": Coming from a BMW and I liked the styling and competitive pricing in this LS 460 luxury auto | After two visits to the dealership they have no answer for the very annoying whistling coming from the driver's side rear view mirror when reaching speeds over 40 mph | Had to do my own detective work seemed to be coming from the driver's window but after some painstaking effort on my part I narrowed it down to the mirror housing | Have to turn up the radio to drown out the intolerable whistling noise | Only time it stops is when it rains | Only disappointing problem | Other than that a great luxury car that gets constant compliments from admirers | 
 "words": I have owned BMW have a Mercedes in the garage for the wife and this is definitely the best built car I have ever driven | I bought the 460 short wheel base | Zero to 60 in 5 | 4-5 | 6 seconds is not too shabby compared to the BMW 7 and Benz S class | Interior ergonomics and technology is not even close the Lexus is superior | The 460 SWB compared to the BMW 750i seems to have more rear seat leg room and the 460L seemed like a waste of money | The BMW may own the market for road feel but its not enough to justify the extra 16k | I was a bmw bigot but the 460 is definitely the king of the class | Gas mileage compared to the others is superior as well | 
 "words": Have had the car 2 months and in the shop twice for very loud wind noise from both front windows | After last fix by dealer noise still a bad problem | Called to complain and they said there is no other fix they can try | I find this unacceptable on an automobile at this price level | Knew I should have stuck with Mercedes | 
 "words": I have been very happy with the LS 460 with the exception of one fault and that is wind noise | Considering that this vehicle is the Lexus flagship it is surprising that it has a fault such as wind noise | Supposedly Lexus is working on a fix | 
 "words": This is the third LS I have owned | I have had 2 LS 430s and loved them | I just purchased the LS 460 and am so disappointed | I am getting about 10 | 8 miles in city driving and I don't drive hard or fast | The wind noise is terrible at highway speeds | Have had electrical problems | Car has been a nightmare | 
 "words": Don't make the same mistake I did | The LS 460 is noisy | New drivers might not notice it but there should be no wind noise | I am in the process of having the two front side windows replaced | There is a significant problem with wind and road noise with this model | After one window was fixed which did correct the wind noise of course there is now a noise in the door | Lexus needs to fix the windows | In addition this engine is more noisy than the ones in the past
 "words": We have only had our LS for a few days and already we love it | We are coming out of a SL500 and a 530xi | We have had a number of Mercedes and BMWs but never before a Lexus | The car rides incredibly smoothly and has excellent power | The mileage is outstanding for the hp | 
 "words": I have owned a Lexus LS for the past 15 years and have recently purchased a new LS 460 | This vehicle is in my opinion without a doubt the the best luxury car in the world for the price | This LS has every feature imaginable except the park itself feature | My LS is black and has chrome wheels that really sets it off | This LS looks drives and rides like the dreamcar that it is | 
 "words": We have had many Benzs over the years and we just got tired of all the mechanical problems and costs | We were ready for a car to rely upon that was luxurious comfortable and beautiful | We got it with the LS 460 | The car is awesome | We considered BMW also but I know we made the right choice | Until you live with the car you cannot appreciate it |

 "words": It would be more helpful if posters identify their specific model | my take is there is a noticeable difference between SWB LWB and the Touring Package | I am very apprehensive at the moment re reliability | I had a rather simple electrical problem which seemed to baffle service personnel | The Parking Assist accessory borders on fraud by Lexus as it relates to the owner | it is complicated flakey and poorly supported with useful instructional material | All 460L models I have seen have this option and when even my dealership couldn't get it to work reliably they advised just don't use it | 
 "words": From previous experiences with Lexus I didn't expect this car to be as fast and sporty yet smooth as it is | Great ride but had to take it back to the dealer 20 mins after I left with it because a loose flap was hitting the tire |
