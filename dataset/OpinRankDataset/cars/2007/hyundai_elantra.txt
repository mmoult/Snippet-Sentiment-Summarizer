REVIEWS
 "words": Have had the vehicle 2 years | Absolutely no problems with anything | Put gas in the car and drive with oil changes every 5000 miles | Not a creak groan or rattle | Very happy with everything that I use the car for | Its comfortable with great gas mileage consistently in the low 30's with mixed driving | Best so far has been 39 | 8mpg on a 700 mile drive to Washington state | Would certainly recommend to anyone who wants a solid dependable reliable comfortable car who has an aversion to dealers workshops | 
 "words": have to replace bulbs all the time 20067 miles NEW TRANSMISSION 4 days in the shop wipers replaced numerous times i'm 61 yrs old owned alot of new cars in my time this is by far the worst read all reviews and research all said best car in class even still they use these terms we all had to laugh at these comments by so called professional as we waited customer sevice wondering what would be next hey got me out of yard work and to you pro's have some integrality then i'll get the grass cut | 
 "words": I was skeptical about buying a Hyundai at first based on past reputation but I'm definitely sold on them now | Great amount of features for the price you pay | The manual transmission makes it fairly sporty to drive and I'm averaging a solid 30 mpg in mixed driving | Plenty of room on the inside spacious trunk | Have only had one minor issue that was fixed quickly under warranty other than that no problems whatsoever | My only other minor complaint is I wish the gearing was such that the rpm's on the freeway would come down a bit at 70 mph it's at about 3000 rpm which is a tad noisy | It's not bothersome though | 
 "words": This is a follow up with my earlier post on my initial purchase | I have now logged 18000 miles after 1 year and 2 months | I have not had any mechanical problems and I have not had any part on this car break on me | I am getting a solid 25-27 mpg in city and 33-36 mpg on the highway | I have installed various after market devices and still have not had any electrical problems | Although the car can use an extra 20-30 hp for passing but still acceleration is adequate | Air conditioning gets the job done even during 100 degree summer temps | After driving this car for over a year I would recommend this car for people that want a car that is good on gas comfortable and great for a commuter | 
 "words": Overall the car is great | Excellent mileage though a better engine and tranny could really get u going great for commute long distance | Plenty of leg space | For a 12k car you can't go wrong | Forget about trading it in after 4 years | 
 "words": My used 2007 Hyundai Elantra is ok | It's a very practical car but I've had to replace my air conditioner 3 times in 2 weeks | My headlight froze and fell out in a -35 Celsius day in Alberta | And Hyundai says it's over abuse on the car | Plus I've only had this car for 3 weeks | It was a former rental from Avis | This car is bad except the looks and fuel economy | DO NOT BUY A HYUNDAI ELANTRA | 
 "words": We get 29-32 mpg even w a lead foot | I still see Elantras on the road think what a pretty car-oh it's like mine | I still enjoy looking outside seeing my shiny red car in the drive | The interior room is great compared to others in this class although I agree that the plastic could use an upgrade on the door panels | The trunk is huge | It rides great but we had to switch out tires as the original ones were death-traps on snow | But now it hauls through the slush and though it slides a bit I haven't gone off the road yet my friend in a Subaru Outback has 2xs this yr | I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it | It's a great car for the price-we got ours used-it was a rental | 
 "words": For the last year I have been the excited owner of this remarkable economy car | Driving this vehicle is an absolute pleasure as it is very comfortable quick and excellent on gas | I have taken several road trips including a 3000-mile round trip to Arizona and have never been more comfortable in a vehicle especially not one of this size | The dashboard layout is impeccable and the lights are beautiful | The engine noise is minimal and returns fantastic performance even while climbing 6 mountain grades in northern AZ | With 48000 miles this car gives me great reason to expect several more years of reliability and and pleasurable driving | 
 "words": We purchased this car for our 15 year old daughter | Since she is a beginning driver we wanted something that | s safe easy to drive with all the bells and whistles for under 20k | We | re impressed with the handling gas mileage interior features and space and warranty | However it is a bit noisy | Overall the Elantra is a great value for the money | 
 "words": This car has a 3 | 8 24valve overhead engine | We have kept the display for mileage on over a 3000 mile period of time and have averaged 27 | 9 mi per gal | The space for hauling is amazing | We hauled two oak doors in it with the back seats folded down | It has lots of snap very easy to handle great to see out of and a very comfortable ride with great lumbar support | Love it | 
 "words": I never thought I would buy an Elantra but this car won me over | The combination of sportiness quiet cabin spaciousness and very sharp interior and exterior made me walk away from the Camry and the Sentra | I still can't believe what a comfy ride I own | 
 "words": I also purchased a 2007 Elantra on 2 19 2007 and within 2 days I noticed that vehicles even U-Hauls were passing me so to stay with traffic the speedometer was showing 85mph on the Interstate | I purposely drove by a stationary radar unit in a 45mph zone going with the flow of traffic the radar indicated 45mph speedometer indicated 55mph | I contacted the Service Manager at the Dealer and he said that he is having alot of complaints about this and that I should bring it in so he could get the part number off the speedometer so they could order a new cluster | 
 "words": it a fun car to drive handles well on the highway and acclerates well 
 "words": PLEASE be careful when purchasing this vehicle | I am a long-time Hyundai owner previously owning a Sonata | I recently purchase a brand new 2007 Elantra | I have had nothing but problems with it since I bought it | A week after the purchase the transmission was acting up jerking and stalling | The service department said it was a manufacturing defect in the seal | A week later now STILL having major transmission problems and still stalling | Also the left turn signal won't cancel and the service department said it worked find | I am truly disappointed in this vehicle and regret buying another Hyundai | 
 "words": This is my 3rd new Hyundai Elantra I have purchsedalso 2000 GLS and 2003 GT | We still have the 2003 and it has not given us ANY trouble 82000 miles | My new 2007 GLS with the 5 speed manual is more than I expected | I got combined city highway mpg of 29 the numbers do not lie | The car seems so much larger than my '03 | It handles and rides like a dream | Other than getting some rims and the windows tinted I can not think of anything I would do to my new car | Hyundai is on par with any Civic and smokes the Corolla | If you do not test drive a Hyundai during your car search then you are doing your self an injustice | 
 "words": Bought the car in jan | 2007 it has 1 | 500 kms and I am wondering if the car has front suspension at all | Very noisy in irregular road the front tren and the direction are causing knockings I am not very happy with | feels like driving a 100 | 000 kms used car | Further the audio is poor and in the highway very noisy wind 
 "words":  What an awesome compact | The car drives almost like a compact sport sedan | Handling is secure and ride and comfort of this vehicle is amazing | I've had all different makes and models of compacts but this car with it's extensive list of standard features and safety ratings as well as the quietness and overall perfromance is my best vehicle yet | And all at a very reasonable price | It really seems like your in a much more expensive compact | I would highly recommend this compact over many others and it's really worth your while to give this car serious consideration before buying another compact | 
 "words": After looking at the Mazda 3 Civic and Corolla we went with the Elantra | The interior size ride and features available with the Limited could not be met by the other three | Closest was the Mazda but it was smaller and the Corola and Civic didn't offer leather and heated seats which have been greatly appreciated | Add in the outstanding warranty and safety features and it became obvious to us which was the car of preference | 
 "words": you will have to spend 8k to 20k more to find a car with this many features gas mileage and quality | If this is any indication of cars to come from hyundai Toyota and Honda are in serious trouble | HYUNDAI doesn't even advertise the fact that on the sun and sound package you get a tape cassette player along with the 6 cd changer | Now I am enjoying my music from the 60's70's 80's | The 07 Elantra is an out the park home run | Interior and exterior chrome accents two tone interior leather blue back lit instruments green lit gear indicator and awsome laid out console make you feel like you are in style and luxury | I'm amazed at the smooth effortless power you get from it's 4 cylinder | 
 "words": This is a great car | I have reviewed Sentra Corolla and Civic | But I came to buy Elantra for its value overall | I bought '07 Elantra GLS Preferred Package Automatic for only 13000 | The other cars don't even come close to that price | The car is well made and its safety features are far above the competitors | The car drives well it is comfortable it is roomy bigger than my old Galant '98 | My wife just loves the car | Thank you Hyundai and keep up the good work | 
 "words": We just bought my daughter a beautiful blue 2007 Elantra | She loved it | Unfortunately someone T-boned her 1 month later and the car rolled over | She and her friend walked out with barely a scratch | This car kept her safe | I will buy another to replace it | 
 "words": Looking for better gas mileage on our daily commute we downsized from a 99 Lexus ES-300 to the Elantra and we don't feel deprived at all | We test drove the Nissan Altima and Honda Accord and Civic Subarus and also the Sonata but we ended up buying the Elantra 4DR SE with sunroof because of the interior roominess comfortable ride excellent handling braking and acceleration | Not to mention that all of the safety features are standard | We've put 500 miles on the car in 2 weeks and are getting an average of 28 MPG or so in mixed city and HWY driving at 65-70 with lots of hills | This car is a great value with a comfortable ride | 
 "words": I just bought the 2007 model in Carobon Gray and I love it | It's fun and comfortable to drive | At first a little sluggish but now it's moving really well | Hyundai said it learns how you drive so around 1000 miles it pickes up more speed | MPG could be a little better but very attractive exterior and interior very roomy and a nice price | 
 "words": I bought my 2007 Elantra in December | I don't have a lot of miles on it yet but so far I love it | I have been looking for other 2007 Elantras on the road but so far I haven't seen any | I am not sure why that is | I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a great mid-size sedan for under 20000 | 
 "words": The car has been great so far it drives very smoothly and the handling is great | Braking with this car feels very solid and controlled too it doesn't dip much in the front | When the car idles the engine is very quiet | The small dimensions of this car also makes manuvering in parking lots quite easy | 
 "words": Best thing about this car isn't the price which is awesome its that its bigger than some midsize sedans in fact its bigger than most midsized sedans of the 90s yet competes with the compacts of the worldmazda3 civic corolla etc | You get so much more standard features warranty for so much less money what's not to like | The corolla is so outdated the civic is great but honda dealers are way too proud of this overpriced car as they don't like to come off sticker the mazda is a good price but you still get so much more with the elantra | Hyundai has come a long way since the 90s just try one out for yourself | 
 "words": I haven't had it for very long but I am very happy with my Elantra | The engine is very quiet and the ride is smooth | It has a lot of nice touches on the interior | 
 "words": just upgraded from the 2004 model | I find myself driving faster I assume its because the ride is smoother and quieter | The increased leg room and wheel size is nice | Its fun to drive and has a good sound system | Probably better to wait till they really start the rebates to buy this car | You cant see as much of the hood front end on the car as in previous years | 
 "words": Bought an 06 in august | Liked itbut when I seen the 07sI just had too have oneNot even the same carlooks greatrides great performs greatfun to drivevery comfortable | The new brake system is outstanding | 
 "words": I bought a white 07 GLS 5 speed stick with the 1500 | 00 option accdcrusie175 watt sound with 6 speakersect for 14800 | 00 | What a bargin | From a safty standpoint alone where else can you get a car with 4 wheel disc breaks abselectronic break force distribution AND 6 yes thats six | standard airbags for under 15 grand | Not to mention all the other standard goodies included the excellent fuel economy super low emessions power everything outstanding warranty and all built to great quality | Hyundai has come a long way and has come to par with the Japanese automakers | The old public perception will still keep resale values down but that is the only knock as far as Im concerened | 
 "words": Although I just bought the vehicle I can tell that it is a good choice | Unlike some suggestions it felt very stable on the road at speeds over 90 MPH | The standard features and looks are great as is the price | Add all this to the warranty and you'll find yourself getting a great deal | Compared to competition Hyundai offers more for a reasonable price | Compared to the Corolla it has better looks options and is more sophisticated | Compared to the Mazda3 it is a smoother ride and also has more options to offer | Finally I found the Civic quite pricy and the looks on the Elantra are better | Add all this to better safety features and warranty and you'll find that this is a good choice | 
 "words": I am very pleased with the car | Very quiet on the road good but not great acceleration handles very nimbly will hold 90 mph with seemingly no effort or noise | 
 "words": I wanted a small well equipped commuter car with good gas mileage | I also considered the Honda Civic LX Mazda M3 I-Touring | If you want style and performance get the Mazda | Excellent long term reputation and a name brand buy the Civic | For me the M3 was too too small inside and not as comfortable | The Civic was at least 2000 more with fewer standard features and has questionable interior styling | The Elantra is very comfortable quiet has fine performance for a small commuter and the warranty far surpasses the other two | With side curtain airbags and four wheel ABS disc brakes it is a leader in safety | Time will tell for long term quality but the longer warranty mitigates this risk | 
 "words": My wife and I have owned a 2007 Elantra GLS since Oct 2006 | So far we are delighted with this car | it has an unrivaled value price ratio | Its fuel economy is impressive 28 36 mpg 8 | 4 6 l 100 km city hwy | According to the EPA 2007 Fuel Economy Guide the Elantra is 2nd among non-hybrid mid-size cars | We love our Elantra because it handles great it's roomy and exquisitely appointed | The car is very quiet though engine noise is evident at high speeds 75 mph 120 km h | On the highway our 5-spd handles just like an automatic we can cruise pass without down-shifting | The Elantra is a high-quality affordable fuel-efficient car with lots of features and all-around good performance | 
 "words": This car is well-equipped and I really appreciate how much attention was given to the detail and accessories in this car | The sound system is fabulous | I would recommend the Elantra as a really nice surprise | Just sit in it and you'll see | Even the dash is attractive | Good job | Hyundai | 
 "words": I love this car | i went from a 04 elantra to the 07 elantra | the design of the car is great | i really like the new look | it's zippy and sporty | the interior is roomy and the blue dash lites are great | plenty of room for tall people | the ride is smooth and comfortable | i really love this car | before my o4 elantra i had a 96 accent and that was a very dependable too |

 "words": So I just bought the Elantra pretty much the first one in the area which is pretty sweet | I have only driven it for about 150 miles but all the first impressions are Great | Interior with all the blue lighting is awesome | Standard features are great too with prefered package on GLS model | It drives very smooth very smooth Its easy to be going faster than you think you are | 70 on the highway with low noise | test drove 06 Civic 07 mazda3 06 Chevy cobalt and a few others and there is no doubt in my mind that I bought the wrong vehicle | Its the best in its class | 
 "words": On Oct 10th my fiance and I were in a car accident that totaled our 2004 Hyundai Elantra | Everyone was fine thanks in part to how safe the vehicle itself was | Now on Oct 18th after looking at many different cars and dealerships we ended up going back to the guys who sold us the '04 and buying an '07 | My first impression of the '07 was how well it handled | I'm able to turn corners sharper than before and my acceleration is amazing compared to anything else I've driven | The trunk space is amazing though you wouldn't think so from the outside | The small details are great a purse trash holder in front is neat | 
 "words": This is an excellent little car | This car drives nicer than the corolla and civic and handles great | Very comfortable | The fuel economy is not as good as I had hoped | I get 25 around town a lot of stop and go | It is very fun to drive and has a great little sound system | I like the mp3 aux jack | Drive this car before you decide to pay more for another model | 
 "words": I read where the 2008 Hyundai's are having a stalling problem due to faulty fuel pump design | I want to include the 2007 Hyundais in the mix | Our car was less than 60 days old when it died on the interstate and my wife was nearly creamed by a semi-truck | She now after reading about the fuel pump problems refuses to drive this car | 
 "words": It has been close to a year since i purchased this Elantra | This is an excellent family car and can easily accommodate 5 6 footers | Excellent speakers good fuel economy and trunk volume make it a worthwhile purchase | 
 "words": 27000 miles in the first 11 mos of ownership with absolutely 0 major problems | 33 mpg with 70 hwy 30 city | Love all of the standard features for the price | If you buy plan on keeping it forever they don't hold resale at all | Only complaints are interior fit and finish this thing is a rattle box | Rattles have formed from everywhere | glove box doors overhead trim and gauge cluster all rattle or squeak | Could benefit from a 5 speed trannyseems sluggish bogged down unless you get on it | All in all though it would be hard to find a better car for the money | As long as reliability stays I will be a happy camper | 
 "words": I thought I would be downgrading from my Santa Fe to the Elantra but I love this car | With gas prices the way they are I love averaging 30-32 mpg mostly highway driving at 80mph | I even managed 42 mpg with a strong tailwind | Going from a V8 to V6 to a 4-cyl I am impressed with its power | I could not have asked for a better price in a car that includes leather heated seats 6 CD changer and MP3 jack | I hear the seats in the back are extremely comfortable and there is plenty of leg room | The trunk can handle a 40 diameter folding table | A less bumpy ride would be nice but it is tolerable | It has been very reliable | I would not want to be doing my 24k miles a year in anything else | 
 "words": I bought this car to replace a 2003 Elantra GT 5 door which was a good car | It was a pretty good car until I was in an accident 10 months after purchasing it | I was hit head on and the drivers airbag did not deploy when it should have | At least the seat belt worked | I contacted Hyundai about the airbags not deploying | Hyundai didn't seem to care | Since the Elantra depreciated quite a bit in 10 months I got a disappointing check from the insurance company after my car was totaled | I went out and bought a Mazda 3 | which was my 2nd choice | Hyundai has standard airbags in their cars but I guess the deployment of the airbags is optional | Thanks Hyundai but no thanks | 
 "words": I bought this car back in September '07 | I loved it then and I love it now | Previously I had a '99 Saturn SL1 | I definitely discovered what I had been missing all those years | I love the way this car handles how safe I feel in it receiving multitudes of compliments from the interior design the roominess and more | 
 "words": I went into the dealership to try the Nissan Versa and Sentra Honda civic Mazda 3 and Scion tc | At the end of the day I test drove the 2007 Hyundai elantra se which was the 3rd manual car I have ever driven in my life and I instantly fell in love | So easy to drive compared to the acura I learned on I got it down in 5 minutes and had to have the car | It feels like a sports car | The interior is massive compared to everything else | So much room and comfort definitely feels more expensive than it was | I've had it for a month now and drive about 30 miles a day and never want to get out of it | Only problem is that gas mileage over speeds of 55 mph is 32 so actual highway mpg at 70 mph is off
 "words": I bought my 2007 Hyundai Elantra to replace my 1997 Chevy Malibu LS car | My Elantra's engine actually has more power than the 3 | 1 liter V6 engine in the Chevy Malibu regardless if I'm doing city driving or highway driving | The 2007 Elantra has virtually no engine noise and absolutely no road or wind noise whatsoever even when traveling at highway speeds | The headrests on the front seats can be adjusted to provide neck support just like the 2008 Nissan Versa's chair height front seats do | The horn sounds like one from a large semi truck | The trunk space is massive | I haven't had the vehicle long enough to test reliability | 
 "words": I have had my elantra for almost a year now | I want to advise anyone out there looking for a car to make sure to look at this one | The fuel economy is good about 30 mpg but i do a lot of highway driving | The size is wonderful | I'm very tall and it was the only car I looked at that I didn't feel cramped in | The best thing about my car was the price | I spent about 3000 dollars less | 
 "words": I got limited and I enjoy this little car | I got heated black leather seats and fog lights | Live in NYC so I get about 23 mpgs but thats 95 city driving | The interior attracted me to this car very underrated | 
 "words": Our Elantra is perfect for shuttling our four kids around to school and sports functions | We are getting about 28-29 miles per gallon in mixed driving | As many reviewers point out this car does not give you a nice smooth ride and is easily blown all over the road by high winds but I think that is to be expected by cars this size | It does however handle well | I experience some annoyingly long gear shifts in the automatic transmission but it is still rather responsive little engine | After 1 year of ownership with heavy use I recommend this car | Only problem experienced so far was with a light in the driver side sun visor | 
 "words": After 10000 miles the ride has been smooth and the features have been pleasant | The dealership I go to is very friendly but they deal in a variety of manufacturers and have many returning customers | I haven't had any significant problems yet | The driver's window squeals and the glove compartment rattles but the interior is wonderful otherwise | The manual transmission does not hold reverse very well and will grind out from time to time | Downshifting into first at very low speeds can be hard sometimes as well | 
 "words": Overall Very Good VALUE for the compared to Corolla and Civic 2-3 grand less | Was about to buy Corolla but Elantra BLEW it away | Looks better and is LARGER SAFER than both | After driving over 6k miles and 6 months here's the COMPLETE deal below | Too many reviews have the good but not the BAD -and there are some | Dealership service HORRENDOUS sales person was big liar | Medium bumps a bit harsh mileage no way near claim closer to 28-30 local city combo quick accelerating bit loud but quiets out | Side mirrors nice big but too big when parallel parking | BUT GOOD FAR outweighs the bad | It's simply the BEST value for no doubt | Watch out Toyota Honda | Why pay more for less | 
 "words": I purchased this car a month ago and found that this car is really comfortable handles and turns well | I am getting 26 mpg avg on 90 city and 10 highway driving | Acceleration is good for 4 cylinder motor | Wind noise is normal at 80mph | Car is built sold doors shut and sounds solid | Excellent value for price strongly recommend checking out this car before spending an extra 2000-4000 to get same quality on other competitors | 
 "words": A very affordable car with features you would pay thousands more for if it were from Japan | It can seat 4 adult males and not have the unlucky ones in the back seat feel like they are in a penalty box | I average 28 | 5 combined and best ever highway mileage was 32 | 76 loaded to the gills | If you have a great deal of stop and go traffic in your commute I would suggest the auto transmission | Buy it and then drive it for 10 years and then sell it for 2500 | 00 | That's my plan BR
 "words": I love my Elantra | It handles like a sports car with tight cornering | Climate control is great and the heated seats are SO nice | The sound system is nice with lots of speakers | The accessory outlet is handy but the steering wheel audio controls are the best | Cruise control is precise | Trunk space is good with drop-down seats for added length | Good leg-room in rear seat | The ride could be softer to feel the bumps less harshly but it's firm and responsive | I think it's sporty and fun especially in red | 
 "words": This car is worth every penny and more | The quality performance standard equipment and price beat the competion by a mile | Honda Toyota and Mazda you better start taking tips from Hyudai soon or you will left in the dust |

 "words": I love driving my Elantra | When I was car shopping I was deciding between a Honda Civic Toyota Corolla | Just before I had decided between the two Hyundai came out with the New 2007 model for their Elantra | It looked very similar to the Civic but it was signifiantly cheaper | So I got the Elantra in January in the color that I wanted | It's Fabulous | 
 "words": I knew this was the right car for me after the first test drive | In fact I talked numbers with the dealer as I sat behind the wheel I didn't want to get out | I was also looking at the Nissan Sentra and the Mazda 3 but they just weren't all the car the Elantra is | I used to have a 2005 Scion xA and I think I'm getting the same fuel economy with a bigger vehicle | I like the fact I was able to get so much more car for my money than co-workers and friends got for their cars | I HIGHLY recommend to anyone | I love the XM radio and haven't even used the standard radio or CD yet | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Elantra | I drive an hour to work every day and with my Elantra this drive is awesome | I love the gas mileage 36 mpg with combined city and highway | All the safety features are great and the car handles very well when driving | More than once has saved me from terrible wrecks being able to get out of the way of other people who were having a bad driving experience | Absolutely nothing to say bad about my Elantra | 
 "words": This is the 14th new car I have bought and it is hands down the best of the lot | 
 "words": This is my sixth consecutive Elantra because it is fun to drive and gets excellent fuel economy while still having reasonable cargo space | In addition I can count on its reliabiltiy | On roads where speed limits are irrelevant I can cruise at 100 mph and the mileage only drops slightly | 
 "words": I found this car to be highly attractive with a well designed interior | My color is black | I have been stopped in supermarket lots by people who can't believe how good the car looks | Great style lines | So many great standard features full of airbags great entry stereo easy to use controls that light up with a dynamic blue glow at night | Fun to drive | Dealer gave a great price I did the research | Personally I like the style better than the Sonata | Remember I did not expect a BMW quality line for this price | What I got was a very good car with superb value that looks expensive | I'm real good with that | 
 "words": A lot of car for the money | Comfortable on long trips and quite good on gas mileage | Got 37mpg on a recent trip | This is my second Hyundai and I'm pleased with both of them | 
 "words": It is exactly what I wanted in an compact car 1 Decent overall performance 2 Small enough to fit most San Francisco parking spaces 3 Roomier than my previous compact 4 Loads of features and refinements to make me feel that I was NOT making any compromises in buying a sub-20k car 5 Killer price especially with the rebate I got 6 Very good gas mileage 7 Anticipated reliability as good as Toyota very important This doesn't get as good gas mileage as a Prius heck it doesn't even get its own stated EPA city MPG of 28 but it is at least low emission PZEV | Hwy MPG is about as promised 36 | The ride experience is just as refined as the Prius but cost me 10k less | 
 "words": This car feels like more expensive car than it really is | I like they way this car handles and drive very smooth and quiet | cabin is well isolated very quiet on highway | nice interior design especially nice looking blue lights | almost 20003000 cheaper than Japanese competitors | fantastic value | overall i rate this vehicle as an excellent all around compact sedan with high buid quality | 
 "words": i have been driving this car for 2 months and I thought I would get used to it but it just drives me crazy the way this car shifts into 4th gear at about 35 mph and then has no power | When you slow down it will shift fine | This is really annoying to me because I drive during rush hour traffic and the flow of traffic usually moves around 35-50 mph
 "words": I did extensive research and while there are cars in its class which have more style more power more reliability more cargo room more mpg and get u more pats on the back the Elantra scores high enough for me in all the categories above but it comes in at 100's to 1000's of dollars cheaper than others in its class | Only 1400 miles on it so my reliability rating is just my expectation based on last gen's Elantra's | The 132 hp is more than ample for everyday driving | Engine and cabin is fairly peaceful when cruising above the spd limit but potholes can ruin that peace easily | A speedometer issue was fixed for free | MPG avg still only 27 in mixed hwy city driving |
