REVIEWS
 "words": This truck is a base vehicle chosen for utility and value | Only options are cruise A C and Limited Slip Differential | After over two and a half years and 34000 miles I couldn't be much happier | I have yet to have a single problem with it | It has a lot of utility ride is smooth and it's quiet for a truck and more comfortable than any car I've driven or ridden in | Fit and finish is outstanding | Ergonomics are excellent Highly recommended
 "words":  So far I'm satisfied with the ride handling comfort and dependability | The mpg Is awesome as I'm getting 25 hwy and 23 around town with the v-64 | 3l I recently went thru 6 states to see a sick family member and the long range fuel mileage was great | The trucks seems to be well worth the price I paid and I've had no problems in 2 years | 
 "words": I have made four trips from Houston TX to the DC area a trip to the mountains off-road in Colarado as well as my daily commute | This truck rides and drives great with a comfortable cab | The 5 | 3 liter V8 provides the power I want without losing the MPG of a larger engine | Could it be improved sure | Probably has in the newer model | I would add storage capacity in-cab as well as more functionality for cup holders and the like | I consistently get 15 MPG in town and 20 MPG on the road | Who would not want more | But that's probably as good as any full size truck | Would I buy again | You bet | 
 "words": Solid truck with no frills but dependable and OK gas mileage for a truck | I have a 2x4 but didn't get stuck in our large snow storm so with good tread depth it isn't too bad | I bought it for work but know I just use it to commute | I am glad I like it because truck SUV market is in the dumps | At least my truck is a V6 so it gets about 16 city 20 freeway | 
 "words": MY husband bought this truck for me | We have three kids and it fits everyone comfortably | They are kept busy with the DVD system and separate entertainment system | 
 "words": I puchased this GMC for the ride | I had a HD 2500 Diesel before | Bad back | I really like this truck not just for the ride but for all the things it brings to the table | This truck is really loaded leatherauto wipers memory seats adjustable brake gas peddles etc | The ride is wonderful | Very comfortable | 
 "words": This is a great truck with a comfortable interior and an impressively smooth ride and quiet engine | The Z71 package helps on the bumps | The engine is powerful sometimes it feels like I'm driving a large sedan with the acceleration and braking | Back seat in extended cab is acceptable | Awesome truck for the price cheaper than the new styles | 
 "words": There are pros cons to purchasing the last model year | Pros Save thousands and all the bugs are worked out | Cons You don't have the latest not always the greatest | Thus far the Sierra has really surprised me | The comfort of this truck is amazing | This is one of the quietest vehicles I have owned | Quieter than my Camry's Nissan'sand Honda's | And it's a truck | 
 "words": This is my first GMC and it seems to be a very well built truck | Very spacious interior and inst | panel layed out well | Smooth ride and very quiet | Have not pulled a trailer as yet but power seems to there if needed | 
 "words": The overall quality of this heavily discounted truck is finally approaching the Asian level | Fit is rather OK but the finish is excellent both inside and out | Engine is very quiet smooth and the power is more than adequate | A C is superb and the full compliment of gauges is quite welcomed | EPA shows 16 21 and thus far I'm realizing close to that | Have always had 4WD trucks for useless reasons and the difference in 2WD ride quality mileage is astounding | I would recommend opting for the locking rear axle though as the low end torque placed on the standard axle simply overwhelms the drive tire in certain situations | So far this very handy vehicle is all and more than advertised | 
 "words": This is my third GM Pickup and once again I'm truly satisfied | Simple clean interior and exterior make this the most versatile vehicle I've ever owned | 
 "words": We love our new 2007 Sierra Classic | It's a great ride with a powerful and reasonably efficent V8 | The cabin is spacious and comfortable | We especially enjoy the hauling towing muscle this truck provides |
