 "words": Bought the truck with 2 miles on it in 2007 | Don | t get me wrong I love my truck and I have had 2 F-150 before this one but it had been in the shop 5 times since I have had it | The first time it was a window gasket | It has had two starters and now it is in the shop getting a new flywheel | It only has 30 miles on it | Even after all this stuff | I still love it and would not trade it for anything else | 
 "words": We love this truck its the best truck we have ever owned | Bought it with 2 miles on it and have loved every mile we have put on it | With the exception of when it was in every ford dealer in the state of Arkansas for the a c squeal | The one that we were told was Normal by all the ford people | I dont see an a c screaming when its on to be normal | and a body plug fell out Odd I think but overall its been a great truck | Especially when you spray liquid wrench on the compressor to make it stop squealing | 
 "words": I really wasn't in favor of my husband buying this truck off the show room floor but it is a workhorse | No problem in the 3 feet of snow that fell in one day the first year we owned it have never had to put extra weight in the back | I'm not a truck person but this truck is AWESOME and fun to drive | 
 "words": This is my 6th F150 Supercrew | 5 | 4 v8 3 | 73 limited slip rearend chrome package Dark shadow gray silver on bottom skid plates and few other goodies | Current mileage 17K | This is a great truck | I've had an entire pallet of ceramic tile3000LBSin the bed of this truck and the only noticeable difference was the truck sat level instead of nose down | Average 12-13mpg city and 18 | 5-20mpg highway | Only one minor problem during a cold spell this winter the 4X4 acuator on the front axle wouldn't engage | Dealer found water in acuator and it had frozen | Dealer replaced it in a few hours I was back in the mud | 
 "words": This is my third f150 | I have always liked them | I purchased this truck new and around 16000 miles I noticed a tapping noise from the engine | The dealer said it was the fuel injectors | I've never heard noisy fuel injectors before | So when winter arrived and I started the truck the noise was even louder than before and when the accelerator is pressed the tapping became quicker | Dealer inspected ran tests for a week and finally called in their Ford rep who advised me that it is a characteristic of the f150 | The salesperson didn't advise me of this trait | I asked what characteristic could I expect in another year or two | Guess what | No answer | 
 "words": This is my 4th F150 Lariat since 2000 and probably the worst Lariat Chrome edition | I've had it for 2 years now and its been in and out of the shop on many occasions for engine bogginess 5 | 4L transmission problems transmission has now been rebuilt brake problems 2 brake jobs already backup sensor problems replaced 2 so far | My lease expires in less than a year | Thank God | I've had enough | I don't think I will be leasing another Ford truck again | 
 "words": I traded in my 06 Chevy Silverado that was tricked out for my Ford | I wanted the bigger engine because mine was a 4 | 6 | My neighbor talked me into to it | The interior of the Ford is overall sexier than Chevy | The FX2 edition comes with the body kit | Although I would have liked the Titan Ford gave me more bang for my buck | For the price I paid for my FX2 I would have only gotten a base model Titan | I lost a little bit of towing but I will never tow that much so in reality I bought a truck that even my wife isn't afraid to drive | Now I just have to ask her can I drive my truck sometime | 
 "words": I have owned my F150 Lariat for a year now | I am coming up on 15000 miles and have had one very minor problem a power window switch it was fixed at no charge with no hassle | I read in many reviews about a lack of power and a sluggish feeling | My F150 has the heavy duty suspension limited slip 3 73 gear ratio and really doesn't do too bad | It has a very smooth powertrain that delivers horsepower evenly through-out the RPM range | Under normal conditions you don't feel the acceleration then all of a sudden you notice that your doing 80MPH | If I want to accelerate quickly I click off the over-drive and it gets right with it | I'm averaging 15-16 MPG mixed hiway-city driving | 
 "words": This is the best truck I've ever owned | I've got 46k miles on it and it drives like the day that I bought it | I don't know why people have all of these negative comments about gas mileage | People have to learn how to drive economically | It's all about driving style | I drive 90 interstate and regularly get over 600 miles out of my 30 gallon tank |

 "words": I purchased this truck to pull my horse trailer I love it | The outside styling is great very sleek and sharp looking | Rides smooth and quiet all the time and rides comfortable | I tried to work with GM on either a Sierra or Silverado and no dealership would work with me so I ended up w a Ford by default and I'm not sorry | I really like this truck | Fuel economy stinks compared to GM's that I've seen I get about 13 MPG compared to almost 20 MPG on GM trucks that friends own | Inside storage is okay although there is a small storage compartment under the radio and its useless very shallow and everything falls out of it | Overall I like this truck a lot and would buy another | 
 "words": I bought my truck when they were giving an incentive to push out the old and in with the new | I love my truck better than the 2006 Silverado I owned prior | The style and elegance are outstanding followed by a great ride | I put it on the road from GA to VA Beach and it road great |

 "words": This truck is a serious machine | I've driven GM trucks for decades | After being tired of replacing transmissions and large repair bills after 100000 miles I decided to give the Blue Egg boys a shot | his truck does not disappoint | I believe the GM might be slightly quicker in 0-60 but put a trailer on the back and you'll appreciate the Ford's torque advantage | Guys Quit wondering | Go get one | 
 "words": This is the greatest truck ever | It is so fun to drive | Just sitting in it with the sunroof leather seats and all the chrome and Harley emblems makes me feel like I am on my Harley Davidson Roadking | The rumble of the stock exhaust just adds to the feeling | Handles great and runs good with the standard 5 | 4 engine | Everyone gives it a second look on the road | No complaints here | Fuel mileage is not great but who cares when you feel good about your ride | 
 "words": I love the truck itself it's easily the nicest looking truck on the road | I've only had mine for three weeks but it's going into the shop to be repainted because someone at the Dearborn plant didn't know how to paint | On three parts of the truck there are paint flaws | Not just flaws but actual debris in the paint like little specks of sand were on the truck when it was painted | Because of this this is the last Ford I buy | The consumer shouldn't have to be forced QA department | So yeah awesome truck awful fit and finish | Word to the wise Do not buy a Ford made in Dearborn | And carefully inspect the vehicle in full sunlight before you do | Look it over and over again | 
 "words": It's the price performance ratio that got me | I wanted towing capacity and 4WD and got such a great deal I couldn't pass it up | Got tired of snooty foreign dealers who wouldn't deal | Thanks to them I got an excellent truck it rides great for a commute or when I tow the boat | I don't need sportscar acceleration- it's a truck |

 "words": This was my first Ford truck after two Dodge Dakotas and I am very impressed and pleased with my new F-150 | First Ford truck in the family since my Dad had a '75 F-250 and while the ruggedness and dependability have not changed thankfully the styling and comfort have | It is an excellent vehicle | 
 "words": I have 4200 miles on my Lariat and absolutley love it | It's very comfortable handles well looks great performs very well | The heated leather seats great stereo and all the other amenities of the Lariat are great | Shifting to 4 wheel drive is as easy as turning a knob and comes in handy on snowy roads | The 3 73 Limited Slip rearend may give it somewhat of an edge in the performance department | I test drove another Lariat that seemed very sluggish and my truck actually gets with it pretty well | I have no problem keeping up or leaving other trucks or cars behind when I get the urge | Gas mileage is fair at 15 16 MPG mixed city hiway miles | I am enjoying this truck immensly |

 "words": This is my 2nd new F150 in 4 yrs just love this trucks everything from the Power to Design both exterior and interior | Even though its just a 4x2 has great traction off roading and recently just made one of my 2 annual trips to Mexico and of course it did great on the Mexican Highways cruising at 95 m | p | h non stop it got about 17 mpg not to bad | What only bothers me and have been told by my selling dealer that the clunking noise that it makes when holding down the brakes and steering is normal even though I dont think it is normal did not have that problem 03 F150 | 
 "words": I have a 2007 ford f150 Stx 4 | 6L | At idle it shakes so bad I had to put a pillow behind my back | Several times it even stalled | Ford said all these trucks do this | It is a natural characteristic of the truck to run rough | I say it is time to recall and fix the design flaw these trucks have |

 "words": This is my first truck- and first American purchase in 15 years | I originally had my heart set on a Tundra | My company fleet manager recommended Ford F150's for the reliability | I was skeptical but after test driving the Ford I fell in love | also test drove Dodge and Chevy Great power and excellent handling | Yes the Tundra and Chevy are more powerful and quicker by the numbers but the Ford just felt solid and sure-footed | 300hp is all I need around town | Nice big industrial-grade interior I'm 6'3 designed for people my size | My kids love it too- it's like a big Tonka truck | I've got the 5 | 4l V8 FX2 Sport SuperCrew | Nice job Ford-you brought me back to American made | 
 "words": Just purchased my 2nd F150 | Told myself I wasn't going to buy another Ford truck again | I was tricked by the interior and exterior design and style of the truck far superior to any of the others | My problem is with the way the truck shifts | The 4 speed auto feels lazy and sluggish when shifting | Also the rear end clunks when the tranny downshifts when accelerating from a lower speed | same as my 1999 F150 | With the O D off it doesnt make the noise | I also can feel the windshield wiper vibrations through the brake and gas pedals | Very annoying | There is minor idle vibration as well | I would not have purchased this truck if I had noticed these issues during my lengthy 10 minute test drive | 
 "words": Great truck so far | Been driving it a week and am very impressed | This truck is definitely not built for speed but it has so much torque | This is a man's truck | Just by touching the gas you will be up to hwy speed pretty quickly and never will never even see your RPM's go above 2300 | I can just imagine the power when I start pulling my camper | Aside from the engine the build and design of the truck is by far my personal favorite of all the trucks | It just looks American and built Ford tough |

 "words": Nice truck but dealer told me I made a mistake buying 5 | 4 motor | Rough idle and vibration at approx 1750 rpm is normal for this truck according to my Ford Dealer | Hard to sit at a light and feel the seat vibrating due to the normally running 5 | 4 l motor at idle | Traded a great running chevrolet at 127000 miles that idled smoother | If Ford cannot resolve this non- existent according to the dealer problem | I will take a bath and go back to a chevrolet | never to buy a ford again
 "words": Happy with truck | Got 17 | 2 MPG with second tank of gas | Only dislike is the handling will fit that with a 3 5 drop kit and sway bars
 "words": This is my second F-150 first one was an 04 FX4 | Both have been great trucks | It's very responsive does well off road and in sand | the shift on the fly comes in handy | Gas mileage has been around 13 | 4 city and 18 | 8 highway | No matter what trim level you get you'll be happy | Definitley go for the 5 | 4 triton the 4 | 6 was sluggish off the line | Overall two thumbs up

 "words": I was going to purchase the Mark Lt until I saw this one | 6k cheaper better interior and what a looker | Rides as nice as a Cadillac | Traded a 05 f150 Lariat crew cab what a diffrence | Better acceleration better build quality and remarkable fit and finish | Way to go Ford | 
 "words": After much research I finally bought my Lariet | Granted I've only had it for two days but I've got to tell you it is an impressive truck | I've read many reviews and some reviewers complain about a lack of power | this certainly is not evident to me and I'm used to a 2001 Mustang GT | It's power is consistant and smooth throughout the RPM range | Inside it is amazingly quiet | the style and comfort of this truck is down right awesome | So far I love it | If it holds up like my 1984 Bronco II did it'll prove to be one hell of a truck | Check back in 10 years for an update | 
 "words": Good all around truck for regular folks | The small V8 is sluggish at first but will move down the road very well | Works fine for what most people do | Rides like a truck not a car | I like that | Get the bigger motor for more serious work | I can get 21mpg highway if I drive reasonably 70 | Pulls a small boat well and has plenty of room and comfort | Sides of the truck are high and makes getting stuff in and out a bit tougher than with previous models | 
 "words": This is the 2nd Ford supercrew I have owned in the last 5 years | the last on I drove 176000 miles and cost me about 800 | 00 in repairs I think this one pulls better and rides better looked at all models and stuck with Ford | 
 "words": Having owned nothing but Nissan Toyota and Honda for the past 30 years I never thought I would own an American built truck but here I am in this new Lariat and I've got to say I've been pretty impressed | Drove it from Wyoming to Arizona and it cruised beautifully was quiet and my bum and back never got tired of riding | Got 19 MPG which I thought was phenomenal considering the weight of this truck | So now I'm selling my Honda Ridgeline which don't get me wrong is an awesome vehicle but I live on a serious 4x4 road and I just feel a lot safer now in the Ford than in the Honda | I am duly impressed and lovin' it | 
 "words": I've been pleased with my F150 | It rides great | It's comfortable | Gas mileage is reasonable for a truck this size | No complaints | 
 "words": One beautifully styled truck both inside and out | I enjoy the comfort and amenities this truck has to offer | Best truck I have driven owned including Toyota and Nissan | Drives and rides like a luxury car | Has met or exceeded my expectations | 
 "words": I just recently purchased the F150 FX2 with crew cab and the 6 | 5 ft truck bed it's a beast | It drives like a luxury car but will pull 9500 lbs | Interior very comfortable sirius radio is great has premium sound system which sounds better than the Chevy Bose | Getting 16 mpg so far | Parking can be difficult with the size but you get used to it | I was comparing a Chevy ext cab to this and in the long run I have a bigger truck Chevy doesn't offer a 6 | 5 ft bed with their crew cab | No complaints so far mileage will improve once broken in and once I add a tonneau cover | Do yourself a favor and get the bigger truck it's there if you need it | 
 "words": The 07 Ford F150 is a very well built truck | This is my 3rd Ford truck | My first one came out of the oil fields and it took a lot of abuse | It had 167000 on it when I was done with it and was still running strong | I can tell you the 07 is built a lot better than that truck | So I have high expectations for it | This truck is not going to win any quarter miles but it will pull which is what you want in a truck | It is a heavy brute with the comfort of a luxury vehicle | I read the reviews on the 07 before I bought it | Some complained about acceleration | I did not think it was bad at all from taking off | It could use a little more at higher speeds but trust me the rest of the truck will out weigh this | If you want to race buy the Mustang | Low end torque trumps | 
 "words": Acceleration was more than I expected from the 4 | 2 V6 | With 202 horsepower and 3 | 55's it is plenty peppy | With 4800 miles on it mileage is around 17 city and 21 highway | Mileage should increase slightly at around the 15000 mile mark when the engine is fully broken in | With the base sound system it produces a very nice note | I am very impressed with the truck | Comfortable supportive seats good ride quality no wind noise at highway speeds and the feel that your are in a well built quality vehicle tells me that I made a good purchase |

 "words": Bought the vehicle on 22 May 07 with 81 miles on the odometer | Left for Wash D | C | on the 26th to attend the event at 'Rolling Thunder memorial | Disappointed with the fuel economy and the black soot at the exhaust pipe | Vehicle drives well but is underpowered on some of the taller hills on Interstate 40 | Thinking the pickup is too heavy for a V6 engine | 
 "words": I've heard some ridiculous commercials from Toyota and Nissan claiming the F150 can't tow a trailer hogwash | This is my 3rd F150 | No complaints ever | I've driven the Chevy Titan Tundra and the Ram and only the Chevy comes close to the F150 | If you want a truck to do what you need with a great ride stick to Ford and Chevy | 
 "words": Super nice truck | I love all the buttons and the leather | Very comfortable truck | This is the second supercrew I have leased in 2yrs | Drove all the different trucks and again I went with the F-150 super crew
 "words": This truck is far and away the best overall value when it comes to full size pickup trucks | You get more towing capacity and interior volume than any other truck out there when comparing total statistics and capability vs | the price paid | Toyota and Nissan also build great trucks but option them so heavily that it's impossible to get the same level of value | The only close comparison to this truck is the Chevrolet GMC twin and it lacks a bit in the towing and interior space department as well as falling behind in the incentives category | Ford's F150 is reliable handles well gets decent mileage and is very comfortable | You cannot go wrong with this vehicle | 
 "words": I like this truck | I need something nimble and reliable and so far this one is great | Very stylish too | Only thing that needs improvement is the mileage | 
 "words": The 2007 Ford SuperCrew I purchased has already had problems | The signal lights stopped working last month and the windshield washer stopped working this month | There is also a heat sheild that has been fixed twice that is still fibrating in my ear | Over all the quality of the truck is poor | It is a nice truck to drive when it is working correctly but it has not worked correctly in since it was new | I would like to trade it in but Ford plays with the pricing so much that it is hard to find what the real value is | They do not hold any value | I will take a 12000-15000 loss on it | 
 "words": I just bought a new 2007 F150 Lariat so I can't speak to long-term quality like some others might but I have to say that it is much more than I expected | The brakes are awesome and what sold me on the truck as I looked for a tie-breaker between it and the 2008 Titan | The ride is very good and the cabin is so quite that it is hard to believe you are in a truck | The accessories are convenitently located and the appeal of the Lariat interior is super | The trim is complex and appealing | There's rich wood trim in combination with some modern metalic type finishes as well as bright chrome | Seat support is good too | I was afraid I would miss my Lincoln but now wonder why I didn't do this sooner | 
 "words": Purchasing this vehicle has been one of the smartest decisions that I could have possibly made | It drives great has average MPG but makes up for it with engine power and design |

 "words": Great looking truck and fun to drive | I have had a horrible experience with Ford about the F 150's air conditioning system cd changer and rear window | The air conditioning system hisses and gurgles while driving | I am in the ultra high line automobile business and I know tricks of the trade | Ford refuses to admit that their is a problem rather they state that the sound is normal | 
 "words": This is a real man's truck | It will take whatever you throw at it and more | The towing and payload is remarkable | Combine that with a powerful triton V-8 and you have a truck that won't hold back | The build is solid and the fuel economy is not so bad | 
 "words": A fantastic truck value-for-money | I looked at Dodge Nissan and Toyota | The Ford F150 is a real truck and it rides like a luxury car thanks to the recent changes in shock positioning | I switched from Ford to Nissan and now I am back in a Ford to stay |

 "words": I bought this truck needing a tough son of a gun to haul thousands of pounds of product on long distance trips for my business and this truck fits the bill | My F-150 always gets great comments from people who love its looks | I just love it because it get the job done | I even slept in it one night because I couldn't find a hotel and it was a good night sleep at the secured rest stop | I wouldn't change much but hopefully Ford will continue to improve on this nice looking tough truck |
