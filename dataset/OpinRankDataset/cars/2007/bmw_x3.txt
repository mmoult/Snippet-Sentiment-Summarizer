REVIEWS
 "words": It's really a good car and all of a driving experience | I work home-office so do not use the car a lot only 7500 miles per year average however it is quite enjoyable to drive it every time I go the airport and go to pick up the kids at school | 
 "words": Fun to drive great handling for a SUV with the 19 and sport package a little rough riding at times though | Comfortable and decent fuel economy premium fuel uhh | No issues to date Nice sound system nav is just ok but the bluetooth rocks | An overlooked small SUV that competes very well all around careful price jumps with options | Good Value if you buy 1 year old | 
 "words": I purchased this with the sports package and absolutely love it | The x3 has superb performance and handling | 
 "words": The BMW X3 is a perfect car for a person who likes performance styling and great handling | Mine has the sports package and M styling and looks terrific | I had driven BMW 5 Series cars for 20 years but needed occasional storage capacity to carry a drum set | I also have an X5 which is beautiful but it doesn't come anywhere near the X3 for performance and handling | The fit and finish is top notch with great features like the full length sunroof | I also enjoy the sitting position which is higher than a sedan but not so high that you sway with every bump like you do in most trucks and SUVs | One great car | 
 "words": This car has gone above and beyond what I expected | Was also looking at the Lexus and Mercedes and their drive compared to the BMW was night and day | If you're looking for a fun car that is the best performing car in its class the BMW X3 is the only logical choice | 
 "words": I bought a 2008 CR-V and simply was not happy with it | It is wonderfully versatile but it had no power was noisy had a rough ride at times and the seats were very uncomfortable | After 3 months I traded the Honda for a CPO X3 and I couldn't be happier | With the X3 I really have to watch my speed | The engine is silky smooth its quiet and feels solid as a rock | It may not be as roomy as the CR-V but I can definitely trade that for the joy of driving | If you are considering a small SUV think if you are buying it for yourself or for others | If you care about passenger comfort and versatility then the CR-V is a great choice | But if you want to have a smile on your face get an X3 | 
 "words": Just purchased my 2007 X3 with 24100 miles on it a little over a week ago | This is the best handling SUV I have driven | Lots of power from the 3 | 0L straight 6 | Very comfortable seats | Stereo sound quality is excellent | Much better than my '04 330ci convertible | I tried the sport package on another X3 and the ride was too rough for my taste | The aesthetic updates for '07 look great | Bluetooth is not always clear but works okay | Also the throttle tip-in is a little touchy and takes some getting used to at low speed | I was looking for a small SUV that was fun to drive this fits the bill nicely | The Japanese companies can't compete with German build quality ride and handling
 "words": I guess I expected more from my first BMW | My wife hated the way it drove around town so now it's mine | The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall | On the highway it rides like a dream | It's like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph | I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service they had to replace the cylinder head | That was another nightmare | The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience | 
 "words": Second BMW first being M3 | Purchased pre-owned | Love almost everything about it | Has just about every possible option and package | Love the 19 wheels | Did have to adjust driving some to accommodate for brake assist and trans system | Once I have done that it is fine and very enjoyable to drive | Do not have problems others have mentioned | Just took a judicious right foot | Very comfy sport seats and great thick M-sport steering wheel | Now that we have a baby it is perfect | Not my M3 but a good compromise for the time being | 
 "words": I have been a BMW and Saab owner for the past 20 years I have to say that after driving the X3 for the past year and a bit I am still very happy that I have it | I enjoy driving and I travel a lot I go where it snows and where it's hot year round I have found that this SAV performs well in most situations and is fun to drive | I have had very few problems and they were all minor ones | The auto transmission that I have operates differently in sport mode providing the burst of torque when you need it but I did not have issues with the transmission as noted by other reviewers | I have also noted that as more miles were driven the fuel economy has gone up close to the stated 26 MPG HWY | 
 "words": Bought this vehicle used as I could not afford new | Unfortunately previous owner never serviced vehicle | Had to take into local BMW dealer 4x before we got the throttle response issue cleared | Car hesitated and bucked was scared to be in traffic when I needed quick acceleration | But the warranty is awesome treated like a queen at dealership given loaner each time who still does that | No other automaker I know of | Computer need to be defragged and re-booted so we could start fresh | It worked my little baby is performing fantastic and I love driving it it truly is a driving experience like the ads say | 
 "words": This is my second x3 the 1st a 2004 so I expected a better BMW but what I got was what others are complaining about poor shifting patterns at speeds under 40 mph | Has been in the shop for software fixes but no improvements and the techs tell me they don't notice the problem | The sport drive is horrible and this is called a sport utility vehicle | This is not what I expected from BMW | 
 "words": Driving along a back country road and slump | The transmission felt like it dropped out the bottom | It left me stranded since when I turned it back on it refused to recognize reverse drive any gear whatsoever | Since then I have had a software update and it is still extremely sluggish in first gear and before I know it I am in third at a snail pace | Highway driving is excellent but in traffic a nightmare and unreliable shifting | I was told this is a worldwide problem by my dealer regarding X3 transmissions and although this is happening to several X3's it is not large enough to recall | There needs to be a recall | Lurching and shifting so hard that it bucks is not acceptable for a BMW | 
 "words": Although this is typically a car for women I'm a 30 year old man and I love this car | I needed to purchase an SUV and love how the X3 drives like a sedan but is great in the snow and on wet surfaces | I enjoy the tight steering and quickness | It's much more agile than any SUV I've ever driven | 
 "words": This is our 3rd X3 and I loved the other two both 2005s | This seems to be a different vehicle | Same great finish and handling but awful acceleration | As written elsewhere it is bothersome and dangerous | I loved the responsive fun to drive qualities of our other X3s | This one makes me scared to enter the highway | Not so fun | Once you get past 40 it is fine but getting there can be tough | Sometimes you punch it and boom other times you count to three before anything happens | Someone is going to get into an accident because of this | We went to the dealer and they tried a software fix but it only made it marginally better and we seem to have lost 1-2 MPG | Disappointing | 
 "words": There is a lot of complaining about the automatic transmission version of this machine | I bought an x3 manual with 6000 miles on it in February 2008 and have put 8000 miles on it since then | This is a great vehicle if you like driving | Fantastic low-end torque | Great acceleration in 2nd 3rd and 4th | 5th and 6 are highway overdrives | Corners flat in aggressive driving | Have never had better brakes | Pulls a utility trailer loaded with stuff for the dump like its not there | I was skeptical about BMW reliability | No issues so far and the 100000 mile warranty should have me covered | It doesn't have all the cup holders and storage that a Japanese vehicle has | drives much better though | 
 "words": I finally had enough | Took a major loss by trading in the 2007 X3 | Bought the car for 43K and got 29K in trade in | The transmission problem in my opinion is dangerous and makes the car unpredictable in many situations turns acceleration from stop | Although I brought it back to the dealer for the fix the problem persisted | In my opinion it is a disgrace that BMW has the audacity to label this thing the ultimate driving machine | I have been permanently soured by the BMW brand | Goodbye | 
 "words": I drive a lot | Over 120 miles a day | Its sleek powerful using the steptronics and comfortable | I have been a BMW owner for a few years now and traded in my 06 330i for the x3 | So far no complaints | 
 "words": Bought this car for my wife who was reluctant to own since she doesn't like the tight sports car like ride | She prefers the soft floating on air feel | Well it's mine now | The X3 has a lot of get up and go and you just have to breathe on the brakes to stop the vehicle | On the highway you need self-control to keep it under 100 mph | It's like riding on a rail | However around town in stop and go traffic it is not smooth acceleration and shifting | It lurches off the line and then quickly starts upshifting | It's what my wife did not like about it and I have to agree | All things considered it is an awesome vehicle and has a real class aura about it | I highly recommend it | 
 "words": Transmission shifting issues shifts so jerky it will actually make me car sick | Have had back to dealer 2x for updates shifting improved but not even close to acceptable for any vehicle but this one is 40k | Dealer told me fix is to shift manually no thanks I didn't buy a stick shift | Live in western PA lots of hills car will not shift out of 2nd gear starting up a hill unless speed exceeds 25 mph that's about 3500 rpm | When you take your foot off the gas it throws you like hitting the brakes | Terrible engineering from a premier automotive company | 
 "words": Bought this as an American Spec X3 in Germany with the Manual 6-speed and most options | a superb driving machine | For an AWD and SUV like vehicle it does very well on gas mileage getting 25 hwy and 20 city and that is at 90 mph on German Autobahns | The vehicle handles very well and the steering is outstanding | I think the 6-speed manual is key to driving pleasure and better mileage contrary to specs but could not imagine using in city traffic and most state side driving stop and go conditions | 
 "words": I bought my x3 in 12 06 | My first Bimmer | The third time I drove it it quit on me | It was in the shop 9 days to re-program a computer problem | The hesitation problem others list is a perfect description of my x3 | Sometimes the hesitation has absolutely scared me | I have had a sidelight casing replaced due to moisture have an obvious rattle from the sunroof cover and have had the lifters clacking since I bought the car | Today I am headed to the dealer to attempt to negotiate my way out of this car into another | The only reason I'm going back to BMW is because of the known problems and my chances of recouping some of the losses on it | Do not recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle to be both fun and utility vehicle | The transmission behaves so erratically it is downright dangerous | On more than several occasions its lack of response has cause near fatal accidents | It typically hesitates between 2-3 gear which is where you are at when entering a turn-about or merging into traffic quickly | The sports drive mode down shifts so hard that you swear you have been rear-ended by another driver | BMWNA has tried to pass this off as part of the adaptive or learning features of this car | 
 "words": There is definite hesitation when attempting quick acceleration | The gps is horrendous | Neither my husband nor myself have figured out how to enter addresses | It just shouldn't be this difficult | His aftermarket gps works like a dream | Not only is it easy to imput data but also warns of traffic slow downs and alternative routes | The stereo is mediocre | The controls are mediocre | 
 "words": Original impression of X3 3 | 0si on test drive was quite positive | I purchased a certified X3 3 | 0si with 12K miles | Car handles well and has powerful engine | Transmission is erratic at best | Sometimes does not engage at all others shifts very hard and can cause nausea in passengers | BMW service can't find issue which suggests that they have not figured out optimal transmission match to the 3 | 0si engine in the X3 | 
 "words": Picked it up in Munich on the European delivery plan | Fantastic to drive in the Austrian and Slovenian Alps | Now driving it for normal U | S | city driving and it continues to be a pleasure | A very few very minor issues oddly placed cupholder on passenger side for example | But have experienced none of the transmission problems others complain of and the overall quality is high | This replaced an Acura TL | I liked the TL a lot but like the X3 better | 
 "words": I bought this when it was between the Acura RDX and Lexus RX | The Bimmer won out with every feature available and I am loving it | Its reliability has been spot on and it has a better warranty than Toyota Honda and GM | If bought be sure to get a tire warranty | I got a nail in mine and got it repaired for 400 | It shows how good the BMW's quality is | Best buy for sure | 
 "words": This is without question the best automobile I've ever owned | It is powerful responsive agile for its size weight and BMW's N52 straight-6 engine is buttery smooth and quiet | Although one doesn't hear it inside the vehicle from outside the vehicle the X3's exhaust note has a nice bit of a growl | I opted for the 6-speed manual transmission and I must say it takes a bit of getting used to | The clutch pedal has a lot of travel in it but the engagement point is a fairly narrow area quite near to where the clutch pedal is in its undepressed state | I'm impressed with the fit and finish of the vehicle and it just has a nice solid feel to it | 
 "words": I have owned this SAV for almost a week now | This is my first small SUV I am a car guy but I travel where there is snow a few times every year and I wanted to be able to take something on my trips that would drive like a car but be able to take the weather with no worries | I think I found my vehicle The handling on the X3 is great and I don't find the suspension too stiff I did not order the sport package | My X3 was ordered with the luxury package the 18 wheels | front seat warmers | servo-tronic steering | upgraded radio and xenon headlights | So far I am very satisfied with this X3 I look forward to every drive every day | My advice is to go and test drive one | 
 "words": Reporting back after 4500 miles driven | This X3 has a faulty transmission | It causes hesistation on acceleration from a stop in curves on hills and in turns | The transmission needs to be reprogrammed reference SB 24-08-07 | Even after reprogramming the transmission is erratic | Would be very careful before purchasing | 
 "words": I had this car for a 1 1 2yrs and I love it | This is my first BMW and I will continue to buy due to the best warranty service | I've taking my car in for an oil change for zero cost | The car handles very well in the rainy season the seats are comfortable | The sunroof is awesome though a little loud and the trunk is very spacious | I've driving this car from and to California and it just runs smoothly | The performance of a BMW is no comparison | 
 "words": I used to be very much against SUVs | I had a purchase and sales agreement all drawn up for a BMW 3 wagon and then at the last minute I asked the sales person to let me drive a 2007 BMW X3 in a 6 speed manual | WOW I was 100 sold | Coming out of a Volvo V70 T5 wagon I needed the practicality of a wagon to haul items for my business | The 3 wagon did this job but was a bit tight | The X3 had more room without sacrificing anything in performance | So far the experience with the vehicle and BMW have been nothing less than superb | Sure it is not a cheap drive but the fit finish is unbelievable | I am getting 23-24 around town and 27 mpg on the highway | I HIGHLY recommend the 6 speed | 
 "words": I have owned the car now for about a week and it performs very well | I don't find any hesitation as some reviews have stated | What some call hesitation is the engine coming up on the torque curve not a transmission problem | I would like to physically be able to check the oil instead of depending on the computer to tell me that it is O | K | This is a great automobile as every BMW I have owned was | 
 "words": I bought my new X3 a week ago and it is a total nightmare | I did not know that there was a major engine hesitation with many of these vehicles and mine is very bad and even dangerous | The steering is not aligned due to either a wheel alignment issue or the wheel itself is not centered | The controls including the navigation system are way too complex and awkward and using knobs to control everything is absurd | My car has cosmetic defects on the fabric on doors and pillars and it looks like they totally left out the quality in this SUV | Overall should have got the RDX | 
 "words": My husband and I love our new X3 | We were originally going to go with the Volvo XC90 but after test driving the X3 we loved it | It handles better than the XC90 and it's cheaper | 
 "words": I downgraded from a mom mobile minivan and I love this little car | It fits me and my two little ones nicely | It's quick and fun to drive | The gas mileage is better than my van and the tank is smaller so fill ups are less too even using premium gas | I love the bluetooth capability | I feel so much cooler in this than my van | 
 "words": I purchased an '07 X3 for my wife six months ago and we couldn't be happier | City parallel parking made short body length important factor | Ultimately we chose between the Acura RDX and the X3 | This '07 X3 had a far superior engine compared to the '05 and '06 versions that we test drove | In fact the older engines disappointed quite a bit | This vehicle handles like a 330 | The AWD was flawless over the New England winter | Mileage is good for an SUV | The ride is just a touch stiff but much softer than my M3 on city roads and overall its a joy to drive | Storage is far better than a sedan | Reliability has been perfect | 
 "words": I was hesitant while buying this car after testing both Acura SUVs Lexus RX Mercedes ML Missan Murano Infiniti FX Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and it performed the best | The only thing I disliked about the car is the limited availability | I live in Maryand and the closest I could find was in Virginia 400 miles away from my dealer | I got the sport package and love it | The seats are more supportive than anything | One thing I would recommend on the car is getting a warranty on your tires | I got a nail in my tire after 1200 miles | It was a 450 tire | Luckily I got it insured | One thing that BMW never has gotten right on any car they have made is cupholders | 
 "words": We purchased the X3 early this year | So far I have no regrets | Reasonable gas mileage | Confortable heated seats and fun to drive | 
 "words": We had a 325xi wagon for the past three years and really enjoyed it | We were not sure that we were going to get another BMW because we wanted to save some money on the payments | So we went and drove a ton of cars and decided that we liked what BMW had to offer in either a new 325 wagon or an X3 | The X3 had the best pricing incentives for a lease so we went with it | The car is a base model with auto trans | It handles like a BMW | We like the leatherette for clean up and comfort | The radio could be better for the price | The DTC is miserable | We turn it off all the time | It makes the car hunt around in 1st and 2nd gear trying to avoid losing traction | 
 "words": X3 is a very beautiful car in my opinion which has a very good stable design and controls that make it very safe and help on running fearless while driving this car | 200 KM hr is not a dangerous speed at all in this car due to its high safety controls | Also it has a good cd player with a fantastic sound system | 
 "words": The interior is well appointed and everything is within easy reach | I'm a little disappointed on the sound system I was told by my BMW rep that iPod connectivity was standard | It does have a port but you pay extra for the integrated cable for control on the sound system the speakers really aren't all that my jeep grand cherokee was better in that aspect | I have only had it 4 days but I just love it otherwise | I look for excuses to go for a drive the gas mileage seems to be ok except when you get on the gas hard tranny seems rough | 
 "words": I've test driven from a toyota RAV to a Benz and all those cars don't come close to the feel styling and performance of this car | Probably those other car companies will take pieces of the body style but there's only one BMW | 
 "words": BMW's European delivery program is one of the best | Our car was waiting in Munich with a tank full of gas and ready for our trip across Germany Switzerland and France | Our X3 performed flawlessly over international roadways and narrow back streets | We enjoyed traveling 1500 miles before leaving the vehicle in Nice FR for shipment to the USA | 
 "words":  I just bought a 2007 BMW X3 | I test drove a different one then took the one off the showroom floor in the color I wanted | I did not notice hesitation on test drive but immediately noticed on mine | It is a week old and I hate it | Not to mention the stupid plastic handle that my knee constantly hits | The hesitation is horrible | It does it from a dead stop and while driving at slow speeds | It is unacceptable to me-I want to return it | The transmission is so erratic that passengers complain about the rough and jolty ride-it is embarrasing to tell them I spent so much on a piece of junk | I think I made a mistake | This is going to be my last BMW | I should have bought the Nissan Murano | 
 "words": Okay I have myself to blame | I buy a new car every two years last one was a 2004 Acura TL not the most expensive car I've owned but far and away the best car in every category | I read the reviews for BMW X3 and know the car was not higly thought of in the past but that 2007 was a NEW year with many improvements | The gas mileage is bad | 18mpg city highway | The tranny is rough and at low RPM there is almost zero torque and a rough go until about 25mph | The electronics are less than high tech the radio is pathetic for a 44k vehicle and the rear seats despite what the catalogue said do not fold flat making the rear space useless for boxes dogs and anything else | 
 "words": I just bought the X3 after months of research | I've been very happy with it | Great engine nice interior good interior storage space for vehicle size | 
 "words": I drug my husband to test drive the Lexus Hybrid SUV he drug me to test drive the X3 | On paper I really thought we would like the Lexus better but the X3 won hands down | Easier to turn into a parking space felt roomier in the front so much fun to drive | I'm only 5'4 but felt I could see out of the X3 better and with more personal space | Now my husband and I are at odds over who gets to drive the SUV it's MINE | Who would have thought | 
 "words": Just completed my first commute in my new '07 X3 it turned the twisty mountain roads into a flat straight freeway | The V6 is very quick smooth handling is fantastic and up down shifts by the 6 speed auto trans were imperceptible | The brakes are almost too good as I am learning to be very gentle with the brake pedal to avoid stopping too fast | Looked at CX-7 RDX RAV4 CR-V Edge the X3 was far and away the most fun to drive while getting better mpg than CX-7 RDX Edge and only 2 highway mpg less than Rav4 CR-V AWD | Storage room with back seats up or down was equal or larger than these other CUV options | 
 "words": Great vehicle dynamics | silky smooth transmission | good trunk space | switched from FX 35 which was a great car | Has less interior storage compartments than FX 35 | Nowhere near the interior quality of the FX | My X3 has a sticker price of 44k and can you belive in that price is not even a car alarm included | But what is bothering me is those very cheap controls on the radio as well as steering wheel | The radio control button is awful | BMW please | I also miss that beautiful vehicle information screen | Sound system just ok | Car has a little wind noise at speeds above 55 mph | City mileage 18-19 mpg | Highway 24-25 mpg so far | 
 "words": Just took delivery on an X3 | The mileage has been a pleasant surprise | The vehicle is well built and feels very solid | The transmission is not up to par with the rest of the vehicle | It doesn't shift smoothly and hesitates | 
 "words": I always said I would NEVER drive an SUV | I'm not | I'm driving an X3 and it's probably the most fun and convenient car I've ever owned | Normally those two words can't be used in the same sentence when describing a car | I'm disappointed in the gas mileage but other BMW owners seem to be fine with it | The interior is divine | Cup holder doesn't hold odd size containers but everything else is perfect | 
 "words": This is my second X3 | Traded in a 2005 | This is one of the best handling cars SAVs out there | You just can not do better then the X-drive system | Get the 18 wheels and Premium Pkge | The Xenon headlamps are great | I get 19 to 20 mpg driving to work but if you drive around 70 mph you won't get 26 mpg | 
 "words": I purchased the X3 in Germany and have had the pleasure of driving 100 mph on the autobahn for the last 3 months | sooo fun | Handles like a dream both in snow and on dry pavement | Steering is quick and responsive | The inside is roomy and quite comfortable | The size is perfect | large enough to pack everything I need and more yet small enough that parking even in Germany is no problem | I didn't get the navigation system because I already had a Tomtom | I ordered a side dash mount from ProClip so the GPS doesn't take up space on the windscreen and the placement is excellent | Top quality vehicle | 
 "words": I owned 3 Ford Explorers back to back | I test drove 2 BMWs an Acura and Lexus | I found myself going back to BMW for a second test drive | I could not believe the handling and drive | I find myself amazed after 2 months each time I get into the car | I find myself uncomfortable when I drive any other car now as in maneuverability | 
 "words": Time to downsize from Lincoln Aviator | '07 X3 is perfect size and 1 3 less to fill gas tank | Fun to drive agile smooth and quick | Interior disappointing | Have an '07 BMW 328xi and expected equivalent interior comfort features on X3 but BMW did not provide them 1 heat AC system is not dual has no vent in rear seat and no heat circulation when engine off | 2 leather comfort of sport seats inferior to 3 series | 3 radio Bluetooth features are limited compared to 3 series | 4 heated seats weak | The iPod add-on connection is awful can't hook-up while driving shows Track not song name cord too short takes glove compartment space use standard auxiliary | Park assist feature annoying | 
 "words": I've just changed my 2005 X3 for a new one | The 2007 feels more comfortable cleaner in style and a bit more powerful | Same old leatherette in the seats but a sturdy more easy to manage leather steering wheel | Lets' put it this way a nicer a gentler car | 
 "words": I bought this for my wife who is very difficult to please and was coming out of a 5 series wagon | This vehicle does everything well and even she is impressed | Most vehicles that are this much fun to drive are not at all practical but this vehicle does it all | Everything about it is top quality | If you drive it you will want to buy it | Don't bother with the sports package | The standard seats are more comfortable and the standard front facia is much better looking | 
 "words": Very beautiful car on the outside | Gets pricey as you add on the options | Competitors offer more features | 
 "words": I have owned my X3 now for several months | The performance is truly unbelievable | I traded in my 2000 ML320 only because the upkeep was becoming more than I was willing to pay | I am so glad I did this is a much nicer vehicle at a better price | Almost ten thousand dollars less | 
 "words": This one has it all styling handling utility safety and everything you would expect from BMW | I thought it was too overpriced until I drove it | It is but it is such a wonderful vehicle I thought I would give it a try and was amazed at the lease payments because the residual value is so high | I don't think you could find a better small SUV or SAV as BMW dubs it | I love the size it's agile and offers utility | It's definitely a sport ute | 
 "words": Just bought this X3 last Saturday | It was a great experience driving it since this is the first BMW we own | The exterior and performance are perfect | The interior could be improved | We may know it more after we drive it more | Not so sure now about reliability and fuel economy | 
 "words": I just purchased this vehicle less than a week ago and I love it | It drives great and no comparison from my last vehicle 2003 xterra | The power is excellent and so far gas is good | This vehicle I can handle having for a very very long time | 
 "words": It's hard to find fault with this one | It's stylish has unique bells and whistles and performs while providing utility and comfort | BMW truly is the ultimate driving experience | It far surpasses the Mercedes sports sedan I traded for it | The only other vehicle I've owned that compares to it is the BMW 5 series I once had |

 "words": This is my first BMW and SUV I love it | Definitely a nice upgrade from a luxury sedan previously had 2 Audis | The ride is firm and sporty and the interior is plush | Lots of power and sports car handling | You owe yourself to take a serious look | 
 "words": Having owned two X5s I'm thrilled with the agility and the power response of the X3 firm ride yes but smooth and tight | A joy to drive sporty and more enjoyable than our Z3 and our 325csi |

 "words": The title of my review says it all about the 2007 X3 | The exterior styling is just amazing | I can't tell you how many people have come up to me after seeing the X3 and said to me hot car or some variation of that | And it's an SUV | Performance is excellent you really need to hold this baby back on the roads | The new 260 hp engine is just perfect | Handling is incredible too | The interior is upgraded and beautiful | You really feel molded to the seats they are so comfortable | The X3 just exudes class in every way | You just feel so great sitting in it and driving it is just plain fun |
