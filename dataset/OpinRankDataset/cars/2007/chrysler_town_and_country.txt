REVIEWS
 "words": I will never purchase another Chrysler | Honda here I come | Tried to support American cars for most of my life | This car has me swearing never again | Replaced a power window motor the power steering motor and something else with in the steering wheel had 2 bad tires drove with a flat-sensor didn't come on replaced brakes at 18K it's in now for bad roof leaking in 3 spots and a sunroof rattle | Door plates surrounding the power window buttons are rubbing down showing signs of wear I never use them | and so are the seats I have 25K miles on the van- -mostly from 3 long trips | I haven't even had it 2 yrs | Bad gas mileage not even 17 MPG | Worst car I've ever owned | Poorest quality | 
 "words": I absolutely love this vehicle | It is so comfortable and for a van the gas mileage is very good at least 20 mpg | 
 "words": Leased this vehicle in Feb | 07 and just mailed Chrysler the check to purchase it | My wife is the principal driver and she loves it | She would not even consider getting a new vehicle when the lease is up | Went 2 to dealers to look at new vehicles and she walked out because she has her heart set on keeping this vehicle | No problems at all | The only things done in 2 years of use is oil changes every 3000 miles and front and rear brakes | Van is loaded with every option available in the Signature Series | The van is extremely practical my only complaint is ITS A MINI VAN | 
 "words": I've owned quite a few automobiles trucks over the yearsbut this definitely has had the most problems | Firsttransmission rebuild at 13000 miles | Now at 27000 miles and the transmission will slap into 2nd gear at low speeds | Also tie-rods replaced at 27000 miles | Service adviser said probably because the tie- rods were made for cars and couldn't take the weight of the van | I've worked on cars myself and have NEVER seen a tie-rod go at 27000 miles | Check the internet I'm not the only one | I know foreign makes have there problems alsobutI'm really disappointed in a 32000 vehicle | 
 "words": Can't say enough about this van | Has been excellent since bought | crossed the country three times with no problems or discomfort | Gass mileage great 30 on hwy 22 city | use full synthic oil only and mileage explodes upward | Do not regret this buy | 
 "words": We lease this Signature Series Touring TC | My wife is the primary driver and she loves it | This vehicle replaced a 2004 Pacifica which I loved | After 30000 miles the only maintenance other than oil changes has been front brake pads | Visibility is much better than the Pacifica | We have the navigation system the DVD system the satellite radio leather interior and sun roof | Lease ends in May and my wife likes this van so much she wants to buy it rather than get a new one | Vehicle is comfortable to drive and ride in the carrying capacity is unbelievable and as much as I hate to admit it is very good family vehicle I never thought we would own a minivan | My only complaint gas mileage
 "words": We needed a second vehicle and decided on a mini van | After searching internet sources we settle on an 07 TC with 15000 miles | The day we went to see it a last minute check turned up the same model with only 5000 on it | I was skeptical to say the least | It turned out to be a Chrysler exec car with 5000 miles and still had the new car showroom smell | You can't fake that | We love it | Our other car is a Caddy Deville and while our van is not a Caddy it is equally comfortable on long trips | The gas mileage with under 10000 on it now is better than the Caddy | I am getting 20-22 mph in town and upwards of 25 on the highway | I can only wait until the mileage gets up there and better MPG | 
 "words": So I had to replace both electric motors on sliding doors also both tie rod ends both front wheel brake pads and I only got 20000 miles on it | I've never seen such poor workmanship on a new vehicle | No wonder Chrysler cannot compete with the competition
 "words": This is my second Chrysler | I have a child in a wheelchair and this vehicle was the best as far as space available inside for chair and passengers | The first was bottom line and cheaper than other brand minivans | It gave me nothing but problems | The second time around I decided to get top of line Chrysler Town and Country Touring maxed out | Bad choice | It wasn't any better | Air conditioner poblems from leaking inside to blowing all kinds of ways the shocks are horrible they actually squeek with every little bump | I went to have them replaced but are on back order | The ride is so rough | Gas mileage is horrible | Short in outlets and many others | This will be my last Chrysler and Dodge | 
 "words": I have owned a Touring for 15 months and no problems | Recentlythe passenger side airbag light came on after I gave a ride to a 250 pound friend my wife is 120 pounds | I think that was because of the Occupant Classification System | Good gas mileage on highway but very disappointing in town | I am very happy with the van's features but the trip computer is a bit complicated particularly to check out while on the road | I just moved my daughter into her college duplex | We had her things in storage over the summer and I moved her things to the duplex | I thought it would take 5 or 6 trips but we did it in two an amazing amount of storage with the 2nd and 3rd row seats down | 
 "words": I will never buy any Chrysler | This vehicle is been at the dealer multiple times for many problems brakes battery AC noises vibrations transmission axlesand more | The service experience is been horrible | last time they had to replace the transmission torque converter for shifting problems and the service adviser said that the problem with a defective shaft was caused by not rotating the tires what | They think people don't know how to search for information these days | 
 "words": Bought this van used with 18k on it | Was a rental for a car company | It is basic with few bells and whistles but the fuel mileage is great | On a long trip of nearly 800 miles I averaged as high as 29 | 7 on interstate with three adults and two children in it | headwind and hill changes it quickly But there is no problem averaging 22 | 7 all around combined mileage | Very pleased with the fuel given the high price of gas | The interior is basic | Mid-row seats are kind of small and not a lot of room between 2nd and 3rd row but we were used to a full-size conversion and it is a 'mini-van | ' Pleased with our purchase and would recommend as an economical option for one with small children | 
 "words": I bought the 07 base TC in a pinch | I didn't do my research I wish I did | I got the base model and the only thing I got was the DVD system BUT headphones weren't available for this trim nor was the van wired for them | Bogus | Not only that but there are no air conditioning vents in the back | We had to get a clip fan from an autoparts store so my son wouldn't be so hot | Nobody warned me also that half of the van's value is lost in the first year I paid 17k some neg | equity and a year later I can't get more than 9k for it | 9 | That's terrible | I am very unhappy and because of this I am never buying a Chrysler or minivan again | 
 "words": The only minus on my town and country is that the clock goes off when the radio dvd goes off | Would like to know whose silly idea that was | Other wise it is wonderful | 
 "words": I really wish I would've taken my time in buying this vehicle | It handles horribly it feels like the steering wheel goes side to side when driving | It veers the right the dealership told me it was the tire pressure not its not fuel efficient | The seat belts on 2nd row seating make it hard for people to get to the 3rd row seating | Probably because its a bench seat but that was bad engineering on Chryslers part | The side view mirrors are manual | Hello this is the millennium | So is the clock you have to put a pen in the clock to change the time | Again I was rushed wish I would've taken my time | I wouldn't buy it again | Oh yeah the 2nd row seats sit so close the front row | No space for my kids | 
 "words": This is our second TC van amazingly I purchased this one new with more options than our first van which was a used Limited | The Stow and Go seating is great but you give up seat comfort for this feature | Our old van seats where much softer and more comfortable | People are knocking power but I just drove this 2000 miles on vacation at 80 MPH and never once did I feel underpowered | My family loves this car and with good maintenance fully expect it to last 10 years | Without a car payment for 5 of those years I will pay my kids college tuition | 
 "words": This is the 3rd and the worst Town Country I have owned | It rattles and chatters 40 mph in the front end | Dealer says it's the road Loud and noisy front end Dealer says that's normal | I had a old 50's pick- up truck that clunked and rattled less | Not fun to drive cause you are never sure if or when something in the front end is going to fall off or break | Excessive wind and road noise | Can't wait to trade it off for a modern vehicle
 "words": I have purchased this van for 17000 out the door | It had 20000 miles on it | I have owned sports car luxury car SUV and by far this is the best vehicle ever comfort storage mpg etc for this price | I was shooting for Toyota but could not touch anything with this year and mileage below 23000 | Everybody is wanting more power | If you want to do passing at 80 mph maybe you need to consider sports car not a van | Rides like a luxury | 
 "words": We have owned the TC for one year and have not had to go in for any warranty repairs at all | Just normal maintanence | The only thing I can fault is the engine power could be better | Very comfortable to drive | 
 "words": We love to drive this van | I had a deer total my 2001 Ford Taurus | My family loves to travel and camp | We purchased the van for comfort and storage | The real test of this van is this next summer when we go camping weather or not it fits all our camping gear and us | We have taken the van a its first road trip and it preformed very well MPG 22 | 5 | 
 "words": This TC does not measure up to my 1997 LX | Quality of interior materials wind noise and a terrible stereo need to be addressed | Poor gas mileage | 
 "words": I drive a lot so I see good and bad about a vehicle | My 2nd minivan but 1st Chrysler | No above bars to assist getting in out of vehicle layout of radio and heat controls poor window controls not good because very close to manual door lock | Seat is okay but behind neck is very uncomfortable | Tires have tread but terrible traction | Feel like vehicles not setting tight on the road | Radio poor reception | Vehicle often feels like it may stall and difficulty accelerating | Blind view areas | Layout of window defrost blows air in your eyes | Uneven dashboard near defrost vents and speakers causes bad reflections in sun | I strongly feel it will cause me to hit something on the right side | 
 "words": My 07 base Town and Country is a gas hog | Mileage is awful in town | I have never made a trip in it | I am sure I will get about 15 mpg on highway | 
 "words": With all the accolades surrounding the Chrysler mini-van I expect a good vehicle | Instead this vehicle seems to be a work in progress | The cruise control couldn't control the speed | The radio was weak in picking up stations | The overhead controls for fuel mileage etc were confusing
 "words": As much as I tried to like this minivan I just can't and here's why | Buzzy engine when downshifting to pass other cars at freeway speeds | Scared my wife more than once when downshifting | Steering wheel controls at the back of the steering wheel | Not very intuitive | Very soft suspension | Not inspiring a lot of confidence while driving around the mountains of Denver CO | Not even full leather seating surfaces or if it is I can't tell | The main seat was leather but the side edges on the seat top felt suspiciously like vinyl | Yes having legacy worker benefits to support does take away from the competitiveness of this minivan compared to others | 
 "words": This is my third T C lease and it seems they've been getting more boring less powerful less fuel efficient but with all the familiar shortcomings | Warped rotors that will need turning replacing at 25-30K barge-like handling barely adequate brakes and a woefully underpowered 6- speaker sound system | The only time I'm happy in this car is when I've got passengers and gear and I'm travelling on the highway in a straight line | 
 "words": This is the best minivan that we have ever had | It is very comfortable and has plenty of power for going up mountains with a load | Brakes are excellent and handling and ride are superior | 
 "words": This was our first new car in 25 years | Wife loves the stow go feature of the van | We've put 10000 miles on so far with no issues | Van is comfortable and we love the power sliding doors and rear liftgate | We've been able to haul several large items that would have never fit in a car | Still too early to tell about gas mileage | Would definitely buy another Chrysler minivan | 
 "words": I traded in my Lexus RX300 for a minivan | This has all the features I had plus more DVD and auto doors trunk | I love that the doors open so I don't have to fool with my 14 month old diaper bag infant w carrier and shopping bags | It's not as lush as the Lexus but it gets the job done | It's loaded but still not comparable | I wish there was a higher end model that felt like a luxury SUV inside | 
 "words": The 2007 is our third TC traded in our 1997 with 150000 miles on it still running | We also have a 2003 TC that has been problem-free | Looked at others but there's no way they have the comfort reliablity and features the TC has | The leather stow n go seats are quite a bit more comfortable than those in a 2005 touring version I have ridden in not bad at all | We will be looking forward to not removing seats every time we want to haul something or take our dogs for an extended drive | The quality of the leather on TC's seats is also a cut above other vans and it's a quieter minivan than others | It's a good value for us | 
 "words": This is our 2nd Town and Country | Loved the first and hope this one is as good as that one was | Like driving it | Miss the hand grips above | Stow and go is really a great feature but you give up comfort in the back seats | Mileage on old van was 18 around town | Don't expect to do much better with this or any other van | No trips required back to the dealer for quality issues | amazing | 
 "words": We love to take long trips in our tc | This is our 3rd one | VERRY HAPPY AGAIN | 
 "words": Nice ride if a little floaty but overall nice | Very nice dash and good night lighting | Seats are comfortable and the Stow and Go is a dream | I do not know the problem everyone has with power but there is enough here | If I need more then I am in the wrong place doing something I should not | Engine is very smooth so I see no need for the DOHC | Overall well worth the money | 
 "words": I just purchased a 2007 | I drove all brands of vans crossover SUVs | There isn't a vehicle out there that rides drives and delivers value like the TC Limited | I had a 2000 Limited | They just keep building a great machine with a lot of comforts | Power doors and back lift gate are wonderful Stow Go is great | 
 "words": We have had several Chrysler Minivans and have been pleased until this one | We must have purchased it too quickly | All of the seats are not as comfortable as any of the others not as much padding | The 3rd seat is embarrassing to friends it cuts the ack of my legs and my toes touch to back of the second seat | I am 4 ft | 11 | Also there are no hand pulls inside which is bad for us and our friends | Maxine Kiger
 "words": This is my Fifth Town Country and Caravan in 10 years | Both me and my wife have one | Every time my lease is up I look at all the vehicles from Honda Toyota and Hyundai | They can't hold a candle to the looks and value of these Chrysler vehicles | I can't wait for the new 2008 model | 
 "words": The van is great | The stow and go seating is so much nicer than my Aerostar had | 
 "words": At first we were very impressive about its smooth drive but later on we found that it becomes bumpy | It could be we get used to it and don't feel the smoothness anymore | Overall it is a good van with the price but we would consider Honda or Toyota for the next purchase | 
 "words": I simply love my new Town Country | It has all of the features that I wanted | I had a 2004 Toyota Sienna that i wanted to shoot a gun at | After 11000 miles the Toyota was rattling like it was going to fall apart | The engine sounded like it had marbles in it | The doors never closed right from the beginning | I went looking for a new van and after driving the Toyota and Honda the Chrysler won hands down | I want to trade my Accord for a new Sebring too | No more boring Japanese for me |
