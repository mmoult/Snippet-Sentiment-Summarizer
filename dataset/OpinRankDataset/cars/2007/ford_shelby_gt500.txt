REVIEWS
 "words": I love it | It is so smooth and easy to drive that you forget how fast it is until you notice the other traffic disappearing behind you | Despite its power and acceleration it gets better gas mileage than a lot of less capabile cars | The brakes are always strong and I haven't caused them to fade yet | The distinctive good looks and exhust sound cause people to look at you as you cruise through the parking lot | You also get to meet a lot of new people that like cars | It seems that everyone that likes cars is drawn to the GT500 | 
 "words": I love this car | I owned 4 others over the years | This is one great car | I have to be careful because you don't realize your doing 80 or better while tooling along | We took a trip to Vegas in her and she cruised along like a dream | I don't know to say but this little red is a keeper | 
 "words": I have owned this Shelby since Nov 06 | I just love to drive it and hear the whine of the supercharger | I have a cold air kit and tune installed and it really woke up the performance of this car | I've also had it on track in Sebring Florida driver's school | It was a blast to drive | I get 16 MPG in town and 21 HWY at eighty | Had some clutch issues that Ford fixed | So far this is the most fun car I have ever owned | There are plenty of aftermarket parts to dress up your pony car the way you like it | And if you want more power add a different supercharger | 
 "words": I am 62 and it is the most fantastic car that I have owned | There is no equal | I have done several upgrades to the hp | it sounds fantastic and its speed is exciting | 
 "words": Have owned several convertibles 05 Vette was my last | The Shelby is just more fun | When you mash the pedal to the floor it just plain hauls | Smokey burnouts at will and will lay rubber at any speed in 1st gear | The ridgity of the car could be better but it not as bad as some of the expert reviews state | The car lacks some of the bells and whistles of the Vette but who cares if you have to turn the lights on off | As far as the wow factor goes its high | Lots of thumbs up and questioning admirers | I think for 10-15K less than the Vette its a steal | 
 "words": I was one of a few owners that had a complete engine failure at 211 miles | It has been the greatest Mustang I have ever owned | I have entered it into 3 shows taking 2 thirds and one first place | It is a real head turner and eats Corvettes | 
 "words": Love the power and all the attention I get with this car | Having the name Shelby just explains it | The ride is quite comfortable for a muslce car | Paid over MSRP with no regrets | Absolutely incredible rush driving it even at the speed limit | I want to be selfish and not recommend it to you because it will only be more prestigious for us to own | 
 "words": I waited for a year I love it I rated the reliability high so I hope it lives up to it | I used to own a Boss 302 they don't even compare the Shelby is fast and it feels great | The rear suspension could be better it hops a little on rough roads | The six speed Tremec is smooth shifting but the clutch is tough | It lets out just a little late for me hopefully it can be adjusted | Great car great look | Thank you Carroll for another great American car | 
 "words": This is a very quick car and is very much fun to drive | The car handles well and is good on gas if driven without flooring it | The workmanship is very good | I have not had any problems with mine just a lot of fun | The car is hard to hook up in first or second gear but different tires could make the difference | 
 "words": Previosly owned 6-7 Vettes '73-'95 plus early 70s Formula Firebirds and late 70s Trans Ams | While powerful only the 73 Corvette 454 big block matched up w the Shelby GT 500 | Both are breathtaking | The Shelby far outclasses the early-mid 90s Vettes | I traded a 2007 GT CS for the Shelby | The GT's straight-line performance pales against all of the aforementioned muscle cars | Groused about paying the 10K over sticker premium but now have zero regrets about price | The Shelby GT 500 is a legitimate 60K ride that is docile until you light the fuse | This is quite simply the best car I've ever owned | If you want your heart to pound the way it did at 21 this is the ticket | 
 "words": Have had a great time driving this car | Horsepower is incredible and handling is much better than I expected | Have had no problems so far gas mileage has been in the high teens but who cares | A well designed car good job Ford another winner in a great Mustang heritage | 
 "words": Have had my Shelby for over 3 months | The car has 3000 miles and she has gone to the shop about every 400 miles blown radiator hose replace tracking sensor engine check light etc | My father bought an Edsel | I believe this car is its reincarnation | Maybe someday I will get the bugs completely worked out of this car | Ford could have done a better job of quality control | This is the one and only Ford I ever intend to own in my lifetime | 
 "words": If you have one of these beasts you fall in love with it at first sight and it just gets better after that | Performance is next to none | Comparisons with the Z06 are a joke as this car's collector's status will be here long after the Z06's are in the junk yard | I was literally blown away by the power this thing generates right off the assmbly line | I can't imagine what some after market mod's will do | I was one of the lucky ones who got mine at MSRP but I can tell you that even at 10-15K over I think it's worth the investment | 
 "words": This is the car that only Ford and Carroll Shelby could build | It has the head turning good looks from the mid sixties Shelbys and the refinements of today's suspension and safety features all rolled into a package that is amazing | 
 "words": The car is everything I thought it would be and more | I was surprised by the amount over invoice I had to pay | Horsepower handling 0-60 its all good | No remorse whatsoever about the car | 
 "words": Waited 19 months to get this car | This car is one of the fastest cars I have ever driven | I would also like more rumble through the mufflers so I'm in the process of fixing that | The satellite radio is sweet with the 1000 watt Shaker system | The handling is real smooth and the braking is number one | BillyRay says if you get a chance to own a Carroll Shelby land rocket | BUY ONE | Because in 20 years 0 to 60 in 4 | 5 will still be fast | hold on | 
 "words": I am 53 years old and owned older Mustang muscle cars in the 60's and 70's but nothing like this car | When the TCS system is disengaged the raw horsepower is frightening | You better be ready for what's about to happen when you step on it | It's hard to drive it and not put your foot in it every time you stop and take off again | I've never ridden on the space shuttle but I can't imagine the rush being any greater | 
 "words": Bought this car for a little over msrp | I have been lucky enough to own several true sports cars in my life from all the major brands | This car is a blast from 0 to 60 | But when the new wears off the interior looks just like Mustang GT and the build quality is not what it should be | I think the Shelby team should have spent a little more time on the interior and fit and finish to make this a 10 out of 10 | Also Ford dealers are trying to charge way to much over msrp for this car | 
 "words": I paid msrp for my Vista Blue GT500 | It was worth if | I have a SVT Cobra and didn't buy this car because of the Shelby name | I have always want to see what a SC 4V 5 | 4l would do in a Mustang | My car will not be a garage queen | I picked my car up in MI and drove it 1600 miles back to FL in 19 hours | Only gripe was the car is to quiet | Didn't sound like a Mustang should | Very fun | can't wait until more parts come out and we start seeing the GT500 putting down 500-600 rwhp | 
 "words": I ordered mine in June and just received it last week | When I first saw this two years ago in New York I knew I had to have one | It is everything I hoped it would be and more | Can not fully explain feeling I had when I saw it for the very first time on the back of the car carrier that brought her to dealership | The acceleration that this car has is probably comparable to being on the space shuttle | It pushes you back into your seat and you remain there until you let up | I have yet to fully open her up | It drives so smooth takes corners with precision accelerates quickly and effortlessly | Driving it on smooth roads at 80mph feels like 40mph | Always wanted to own a Shelby dream come true | 
 "words": First for the naysayers I put on just a few miles then went straight to the chassis dyno | How does 460hp 445lb ft of tq rear wheels sound | That's PURE stock not a single change from stock | Same dyno a very healthy 426 Hemi made 310hp wheels | that's 150 rwhp over a HEMI | Nothing short of incredible overall | I would take this car over 2 Z06's | Fit finish is SUPERB | Paint is the nicest I have ever seen on an American car I am a body man painter | Not a single complaint | Minor mods put these cars in the 10's in 1 4 mile | Braking handling are also nothing short of incredible | 60-0 110ft | A very nice chassis with too many changes over standard Mustang GT to mention | 
 "words": I traded in my Z06 for this car and paid way over sticker | Thought at the time I had to have it | Shame on Ford for letting dealers charge way more than msrp for the car | That's what is wrong with Ford and why no one wants to get ripped off by them | Save some money and get a Vette or wait for the price to drop | 
 "words": Upon hearing the hp rating and performance numbers I expected this car to ride slightly better than a go-kart | I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the ride was and the tameness of 500 horses with normal driving | 
 "words": I paid quite a bit over sticker for this baby | nice car but for the price well | There's nothing wrong with the car itself | It's a great car just pricey | It drives nicely a bit front-heavy but its straight-line performance is amazing |
