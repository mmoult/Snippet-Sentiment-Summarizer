REVIEWS
 "words": I purchase this car for my wife's birthday a couple of years ago | She has been the primary driver | I have maintained the vehicle since new and the only things I have done are routine maintenance | The tires will need to be replaced soon but they are OEM and have give good service | The fit and finish rival the best SUV's out there | It has NO squeaks or rattles and the paint looks like new | The last time I had the tires rotated and balanced the brakes showed only 50 wear | My wife's cars always eat pads so I am really impressed | Everything works just like it was new | Absolutely no problems | The warranty is the best in the industry | Can't beat it | 
 "words": The 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe is well made vehicle | We have had the SUV for over 2 years we have experienced absolutely no problem | We would definitely buy another Hyundai | 
 "words": Purchased this vehicle new off the truck | Thought I was getting a good deal for the money but have had nothing but problems with this vehicle | Had to put new tires on at 18000 miles along with new rear brakes | Hyundai would NOT even speak to us about it | Wear Items | Now at 25000 miles it has been in the shop 4 times for throttle sensor issues | Actually had the dealer I purchased the vehicle from deem the car UNSAFE to drive out of their repair shop at 18000 miles | RIDICULOUS | Never owned such a undependable vehicle | Will NEVER purchase another Hyundai | Currently getting ready to contact an attorney in regards to this terrible vehicle | SAVE YOUR MONEY | 
 "words": This vehicle has been a joy to drive | I still have not Had any of the problems written about by others | I have not had any interior light problems either | This could be because I purchased vehicle at the end of May 2007 | Earlier models in the year may not have had all of the interior map dome lights and automatic switches installed at time of purchase | I learned from past experience to purchase a new vehicle as late in model year as possible | This way manufacture would have gotten feed back on your particular model make | For example | if you purchased your Santa Fe Limited 3 | 3 liter engine in september of 2006 interior lights may not have come on when doors were opened | Later on yes | 
 "words": I bought the car new in November 2007 | Having high hopes this would be the last car I would have to buy for a long time | I had the car in for the 15000 mile maintenance in July 2009 and mentioned it had started making a roaring noise more prevalent at lower speeds | I was told it was tire noise and the tires were feathering | I have had the tires rotated at the specified times why would they feather | If they are feathering at 15000 miles something's wrong | I have not been able to get any results from Hyundai as to the real problem | The car is also downshifting hard at 30 miles when coming to a stop | I don't think I'll be buying any make model or type of Hyundai again | 
 "words": Although a comfortable car I have had chronic problems with the sensors since it reached about 13000 miles | I currently only have 21000 miles and yet it has been in the shop three times this summer and probably 8 times last summer | Every time they think they have found which sensor it is a few weeks later the check engine light comes on after the car starts hesitating and what seems like misfiring | When you pay 26000 for a new car you should be able to rely on it when you still have such low mileage | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle almost totally based on looks then the problems started i put a new transmission in it at 22000 KM then i got it towed to Saskatoon cause the speedometer was bouncing up and down and the check engine light came on got it there and they said nothing was wrong then the found that the brain was not working they replaced that then the sunroof started to leak so they replaced that after they did that it leaked worse now they say there is nothing they can do to fix it then i broke down on my way to Edmonton the fuel control throttle went on it and they had it for about a week to fix that i have had nothing but problems i talked to Hyundai Canada and they won't do anything | 
 "words": I test drove or looked at other small SUVs | I purchased the Santa Fe Limited | The 3 | 3 liter engine is the best choice as appose to the 2 | 7 liter engine | My mechanic told me that the smaller engine is just a hiped up four cylinder engine | Even though the gas mileage suffers some what | The added power was worth it to me | I love driving this truck | it handles like a car and rides smoothly | After two plus yearsthe firm ride has loosened up a bit | I've driven it from New York to Soutn Carolina to Montauk Point and Orient Point from Western Nassua | Also four trips to Maryland | The Santa Fe had good manners at highway speeds | It did not drift like others have reported | I love everything | 
 "words": My first try with a Hyundai | Live in NE and wanted a 4-WD | Expected fair value at best but very suprised | Happy with overall performance | A real tank in the snow | Unstoppable | Even my hwy mileage is at 26 mph | better than book Need 6 CD player and GPS next time | Front hood slightly overextended | Needs better map lighting | 
 "words": Purchased car used with 17K miles from dealer | Reading was 20 | 1 mpg drove it home and mpg began to drop immediately | Went as low as 12 | 8 but then had problem with 02 sensor | Dealer said that mileage would improve after replacement | It got a little better now back up to 15 | 1 city | On trips to Tahoe the best mpg was 18 | Overall I like the car but given the times one can't make buying decisions on cars w o taking mpg into account | I would never have bought this car if I'd known what the true mileage would be | I think that all of the disclaimers given by both the dealers and the feds are outrageous | A consumer should be entitled to minimal expectations for such a critical feature | 
 "words": The Santa Fe is quieter and more enjoyable to drive than my Buick Rendezvous that I really liked | It's got a lot of standard features considering the fact that this is the base model | The 2 | 7 automatic V6 is OK in coastal NC where we live but strains in the mountains according to my wife I wasn't with her | The stick-shift feature apparently was useful in coping with the steeper road grades | At 16 | 5 MPG city fuel economy is disappointing | No problems at all so far but after 3 1 2 months we only have 2900 miles on it | 
 "words": 1 | 5 months of ownership 2500 miles the car broke down on the road | Due to the lack of parts the repair took 2 weeks 3cat converters and 2 O2 sensors | Two weeks later the car broke down again this time it was a computer module and a disconected wire | While driving car home from the dealer I noticed that the engine noise was so loud the I could not hear the radio | It is now back at the dealer waiting for repair for the 3rd time | 
 "words": Don't be put off by the name Hyundai | They are building some of the best cars out there and the 2007 Santa Fe is no exception | The car is almost flawless in the fit and finish | The paint quality is superb | The gas mileage is around 22 which is pretty good for a seven seat SUV | The engine is whisper quiet even when cold | It is like getting a Lexus at half price | I hit a Deer with the Santa Fe going about 40 and killed the deer | The car only had a tiny dent on the bumber so you know they are built well | The 18 tires are nice and standard | Well done Hyundai | 
 "words": the front end had a pinching noise when the steering was compleatly turned in either direction And the car was in a compleate u turn with weight bearing down on which ever side the wheel was turned might jus be an isolated fault
 "words": Having previously owned a 2003 Santa Fe when the new 2007 came out I had to have one | It was the biggest mistake I have ever made | Hyundai Motor America has been completely uncooperative in regards to warranty issues | Hyundai may offer a great warranty but don't be fooled | I was sold a lemon | The car has been in the shop EIGHT times since we bought it nine months ago | The car had a faulty engine coil misfiring in the 5th cylinder 4 times entire fuel system malfunction improperly installed computer software and finally two bad oxygen sensors | We are so fed up that we are now selling the 2003 because we just need to cut all ties with Hyundai | Buyer beware | 
 "words": This is by far the best car that we've ever owned and I'm not just saying this because my husband helped build it | It really is | Everyone who rides in it comments on the smooth ride and how quite it is | So far I've been averaging about 21 mpg in-town highway which is about what I expected | We've only had the car for about 3 months but we've taken it on 2 trips | Preformed excellently on both | I love this car and to be honest I feel a little sorry for anyone who isn't driving one | 
 "words": I was skeptical of the Hyundai Sante Fe after driving Jeep Grand Cherokee's for the last 13 years I still have two of them however | I am impressed not only from performance to design | I really like my Hyundai and Oscar at Lake Norman Hyundai Huntersville NC was great to work with | 
 "words": I was first impressed but quickly disappointed | After owning the vehicle for 2 weeks the rear right tail light had built up condensation | Then the check engine light came on and found out that the Catalytic converter was bad | how can that be | I do not even have 8 thousand miles on the vehicle and I am dumping it | Oh yeah | one more thing | the stupid visor on the passengers side fell completely off | just hanging by a few wires | 
 "words": Great fun to drive great comfort great reliablity love the new design nice performance nice fuel economy 21mpg hiway like 24mpg drove 800 miles very comfortable | happy with my Santa Fe | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle because I really like the new body style on the 07 | I looked at all the other comparable SUV's and thought I would take a chance on the Santa Fe because of the warranty | Really nice ride compared to my old Rav 4 | Not too big but just right for my family of 4 | I do alot of road mileage and am getting approx 24 MPG as stated for highway and 22 combined driving | 
 "words": I just purchased my 3rd SantaFe | I owned a 2002 sold it to a friend purchased a 2005 sold that one to another friend | Now I have a new 2007 SantaFe SE with the premium package | I am THRILLED to say the least | LOVE everything about it especially the color Natural Khaki | I work with over 15 people that own SantaFes as well | 
 "words": I love it | Had my car a month and I love driving it everyday | Seems to lack a little power while pulling hills in cruse control but other then that I have no issues
 "words": This model vehicle is not getting the mileage I was told I would get | At 3000 miles I called the dealer and told him I was getting 19 | 1 hwy mile per gallon | She told me I would have to have about 6000 to get the miles that was on the sticker | At 6000 miles i called her and she told me it would get better after 8000 mile | I knew something was not right | I took it to the dealer and had a diagnostic check and everything was within the parramimeters of the manufactorers specs | I now have 11000 miles on the car and I am getting 19 | 8 hwy | My sticker said 19 city and 25 hwy | A dealer in Ohio said I would not get any better | I would not reccomend this car for fuel mileage the 2008sticker 17 and 23 
 "words": I owned a 2003 Hyundai Sante Fe and LOVED it | drove it into the ground | Once it died I was being pushed to buy a Tucson which I didn't like | I bought the new Sante Fe SE and LOVE the black mahogany type trim on the dash and easily accessible dash features | The fabric in the newer models as well as the interior trim of the doors is much less durable with scuff marks appearing very easily | The older models had a more chenille type fabric but the newer models have a flat and rough type fabric | I LOVE the Miles to Empty Gas Gauge | This car handles smoothly and is MUCH quieter than Hyundai's other models | 
 "words": I actually think that Hyundai must have determined its 'city' mileage based on suburban driving | Living downtown continuously stopping and starting I am getting 15 | 3 regardless of the kind of fuel I use | I am also a very relaxed driver | 
 "words": Driving is decent for an SUV along with the looks however I have owned my first-time Hyundai 2 months and it has been in the shop over half of that due to a sunroof issue | I am on my 5th sunroof and the problems are still not corrected | I contacted the consumer affairs department and received a case number and that is the last time I have heard from them | I have called to update information and have been told repeatedly that my case manager will be in touch and this has been going on for a month with still no contact | The sunroof still leaks and when open rattles to the point it sounds like the glass is going to brake | Now I am again waiting for them to decide what to do | Horrible | 
 "words": I looked at Honda Toyota Subaru and Ford | This car has them all beat | Hyundai has put together an incredible package for the money | The car looks great and is a lot of fun to drive | The car has the feel of a larger car | I don't feel like I'm driving a smaller SUV | Never dreamed I would own a Hyundai
 "words": My wife and I looked at all of the SUV's CUV's in this class and while I was trying to steer her other more conservative directions she liked the Santa Fe the most so we bought | I have been impressed so far with the overall design build quality and performance of this vehicle | We have had it back to the dealer for a few very minor warranty issues and everything has been handled in a satisfactory manner | If Hyundai continues this direction then they will no doubt be a serious threat to Toyota and Honda in short order | IMO Toyota and Honda still have an edge in quality and reputation but Hyundai is a better value | you get much more for your money | 
 "words": I checked many cars and Santa Fe felt better than any of them for less money | I had a difficult time getting over the name Hyundai but I am glad I did | I saved myself a lot of money and I have a great car | More I drive this car more I like it | I still get stunned every time I turn how tight the turning radius is | I just added the premium package and enjoy my moon roof on top of everything else this car has | It's a great crossover SUV that drives like a luxury car but has plenty of storage and power of the SUV | 
 "words": Being a auto tech for 20 plus I know what to look for and after driving all in this class from acuras to toyotas we choose this the only one complaint I have is rear isolation the rav 4 was better but the lack of gutless power of toys 4 banger I whent with the sante fe hands down bought the se fwd model love it 24mpg average and almost as fast as my 66 skylark with a built motor go figure | offer invoice they will take it ask to see it they will show you | traded in my 06 solara for this suv and I like it alot would never go back to a car | 
 "words": Just purchased this vehicle took ride from Florida to North Carolina | Santa Fe rode just like a car not a SUV | Owned car for 1 week now put on 1500 miles and love it | Gas mileage not bad 26-28 mpg depending on your speed on highway | Not Hybriid mileage but acceptable | Nothing negative to say about car | 
 "words": I researched many different SUV's and test drove most of them | After all was said and done I selected the Hyundai Santa Fe Limited with FWD | I wanted all the options that the Santa Fe offered | I added 20 mag wheels with wide tires | I must say this is the best overall vehicle I have ever owned | It answers all my driving needs completely and I would suggest that anyone looking at a Honda Toyota Mazada Kia or any SUV to strongly take a look and test drive the Fanta Fe Limited | This is by far the best vehicle quality wise and safety wise that you can buy for the money you pay | I have never owned a Hyundai and never thought I would until I checked out the reviews and the vehicle itself | 
 "words": We bought the Limited with all the extras | Interior quite nice with leather but after a 2000 mile trip a bit disappointing | Read all the reviews beforehand | comfort for driver is good power seat but front passenger is lousy | Seats too short power seat not available | Picking up road noise already and bumpier ride than expected | Cabin a bit small for front passenger afer a few hours and seats too short to rest legs can't adjust seat enough to compensate | Did not expect comfort to disappear so quickly | It is definitely a lightweight in windy conditions also | Very disappointed | 
 "words": My opinion is that the trailer pre wiring package is a fraud | THere is no adapter to plug and play into the fittings on the vehicle | The wiring harness available from the manufacturer splices into brake lights | This should be considered a major manufacturing defect | 
 "words": This is one of the nicest vehicles I have ever driven | As far as AWD SUV's it is the nicest | I have driven and owned various SUVs and this is by far the best | Jeep Honda Toyota don't match it | I am hoping though that they are right about the improved quality and it lasts me for awhile | Though I have had Hondas that were junk | I guess you just have to get lucky | 
 "words": I have owned my Santa Fe for 3 weeks | I have always been a Ford owner but this car made me say WOW | Solid Build quiet ride fuel economy exactly was the sticker claims extremely fun to drive | I thought I would never buy a foreign vehicle but I am sold | 
 "words": I just bought this a few days ago for my wife after trading my 12 year old Isuzu Trooper in | The Santa Fe feels decidely different than the SUV it feels much more like a car and the car chassis build is the clear reason | Its taking me a while to get used to the lower seating compared to the Trooper reduced powwer and somwwhat limiting rear visibility so far | But those are areas I feel I can get accustomed to its a differrent vehicle after all | The Santa Fe handles well for its class feels luxurious for the price on the inside has modern styling provides good fuel economy for the class and is fun to drive around and do regular chores in | 
 "words": With all the extras you get that other SUV manufactures charge extra for you can not beat the price of the Santa Fe | Recommend anyone interested in a SUV to check it out | 
 "words": We drove so many different vehicles so many differnt times | This little SUV is awesome | We have two kids and they have plenty of room and we have plenty of space | When I first suggested Hyundia I was doing it as a joke | I remember the disposible cars of the early 90s | My wife said she would not even test drive one | After I started to read the reviews I was amazed | After driving one | WOW | My wife loves it | I love to let her drive my F150 just so I can drive it | Drives better than her Maxima use to | Absolutely LOVE IT | 
 "words": Most of my friends say it must be a cold day in hell | I took the plunge and switched from Ford | I am so happy that I did | This vehicle is awesome and exceeds my expectations | I have owned this for 1 month and I cant believe the difference from an American car | Outstanding ride comfort and quiet solid vehicle | 
 "words": Only had this car for a week now and I Like it alot | Smooth ride engine is very quiet and a nice design | Love the sportronic transmission which was one of the main reasons I got this suv in addition to all the safety features | Cant beat the price | Hyundai has definately come a long way | 
 "words": So far the best auto yet | I find no fault with it | Find that it drives better then friend's Lexus 330 | Hope it continues this nice for a few years | As a retired electrical engineer I am looking at every detail of the SUV | 
 "words": I test drove the Honda Pilot CRV and Element and the Mazda CR7 | None of them gave me the overall satisfaction I get from the Sante Fe | This car does everything well | The gas mileage is not bad when you consider the vehicle weighs 4300 lbs | I traded in a very temperamental '02 Audi Allroad for the Sante Fe and have no regrets | 
 "words": Bought 2007 SF SE with no option packages | Priced as a family sedan this amazing SUV or CUV call it whatever you want performs as a high-priced Lexus | Fuel economy is OK not great but c'mon this is sport utility with 3 | 3L engine | Don't expect to get 28-30 miles per gallon because it's not a economy car | Just buy it and enjoy it | 
 "words": I just bought my Santa Fe a few days ago and I can't stop smiling | I ruled the car out in the beginning of my SUV search because I didn't know the body style had changed this year | Originally went to look at the VeraCruz and quickly changed my mind | The 2007 Santa Fe is beautiful | The interior for the price is really what got me | I love the blue lights touch of chrome and wood accents | The dual climate control is awesome because I can be freezing when my boyfriends hot | I looked at every SUV out there Mitsubishis Hondas Nissans Toyotas Jeeps | You name it I looked into it | The Santa Fe was the first car I didn't have a single complaint about | I cant stop smiling when I'm driving it | 
 "words": We purchased our 2007 Santa Fe after several weeks of near obsessive on-line research | With two teen drivers safety was our number one priority | The Santa Fe offers front side and curtain airbags | anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control all standard | It also weighs more than many of its competitors | It is a Top Pick for safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety | Price Value was equally imortant to us | The CRV and RAV4 lacked many of the amenities that are standard on the Santa Fe and can't compare on the warranty and yet are priced thousands of dollars higher | We also happen to like the look of the newly designed Santa Fe so our decision was made | 
 "words": I wish the DVD controls were located somewhere else | they get kicked alot | the light interior looks nicebut is not kid-friendly | I really love my Santa Fe | The '07 is so much more luxurious than my previous '01 | I like my Santa Fe better than my husband's BMW 325i | We always take my Santa Fe on roadtrips not the BMW | I love the space the drive the warranty the look I feel smart driving it | It's a good bang for the buck | There's only 1 Santa Fe to choose Limited fully loaded | i didn't like the bare bones models | Bite the bullet spend the 32K for the top of the line Santa Fe | 
 "words": After my lease on my 2004 Toyota Highlander expired I thought about a new 2007 Highlander | I also took a hard look at Hyundai's Santa Fe and Subaru's Forester | In the end I took a chance on Hyundai a 'chance' because after all this is the parent company with the DNA of the Excel I remember so well from the late 80's | Well the Santa Fe has proven to be a winner | It meets or exceeds Highlander's standards in every aspect except fuel economy | Fit and finish is superb | The cabin is quiet and comofortable steering responsive and confident | I recommend the Santa Fe for anyone looking for a CUV | It compares to or exceeds the best the rest of the field has to offer | 
 "words": We purchased our SE AWD back in March and just love it | Have had it on 2 long road trips and it is so fun and comfortable to drive | I was a little reluctant about getting a Hyundai but after owning the vehicle for 4 months no regrets | We test drove the CRV and others no comparison in value features and comfort | Many comments here about the poor interior lighting | Hyundai has corrected this on never production models and they will fix older 2007 vehicles for free if you ask | My map lights now go on when the doors are opened | Great customer service from Hyundai USA on this | 
 "words": If you can find anything close to a match for this vehicle | good luck | For the price the Hyundai Santa Fe cannot be beat | The looks styling handling and performance are outstanding | 
 "words": We're just over 3000 miles into our new Santa Fe which we bought after a 5 minute test drive having read the reviews on line | Wow what a motor my wife has moved from Mercedes Benz to Hyundai and no wonder what a super product | We test drove the new 2008 C Class today just to compare the two brands | The Santa Fe 3 | 3ltr Ltd edition in Black with Cream Leather interior and the high driving position wins hands down | We had a spin in the 2 | 7 litre version which also impressed however the bigger engine makes a massive difference to the overall driving experience | For those of you lucky enough to own the new Santa Fe happy motoring for those of you who are still sitting on the fence enjoy the view
 "words": Purchased this vehicle two weeks ago for my wife | She and I both love it | We had a power seat switch fail within a week but the dealership addressed it quickly | Power is good with the 3 | 3L | The 2 | 7L would not be enough | Turns tight quiet on the road | Seats have enough adjustability to be comfortable | Good leg room in 2nd row | 
 "words": I have only had my Santa Fe for a month but so far so good | I was a little worried about getting a Hyundai until I test drove this SUV | Hyundai has redesigned the body style and finally it doesn't look like a cheap rounded SUV | You can't beat the value either | I was orginally looking at the Honda CR-V but the prices are so high for a smaller SUV | The Santa Fe drives very smooth like a luxury car and is easy to handle | This is my first SUV going from driving a small two door car | The Santa Fe has made the transition an easy one | It is great that things such as XM radio come standard with this SUV | 
 "words": Had the car for 3 weeks now this is by far the best car i have ever own the fit and finish is equal to the other importsand thousands less | My GLS is a Canadain car and is the same is a American Ltd | all i can say is i just love driving it and i can't say that with the many other cars i have had | 
 "words": Own a Fully loaded Honda Oddysey and a Toy Matrix | We did not enjoy the Matrix | we did enjoy the resale value | We looked at everything | Honda Pilot 4-Runner CX7 CX9 Kia Sorento | then in the car area we almost settled on a pre-owned10k Infiniti G35 but we have 3 kids so we were looking for blend of what our Oddysey and our Matrix gave us | Plenty of space inside for trips and modern functionality in a cool package When we drove the Santa Fe we fell in love and knew it | not only is the car briliantly engineered inside and out | The build quality is visible everywhere | hence the 5 star rating | This is truly a unique vehicle with the entirety of its features warranty

 "words": I purchased the pearl white model and it's a real head turner | The SUV is beautiful inside and out | I notice other SUV drivers looking at it in traffic and I've even had some approach me to check it out | I could see their jealousy and envy in their faces | I feel badly for the people who bought a 2006 Santa Fe | I would be kicking myself right now | When my wife suggested a Hyundai I thought she was nuts | The name stigma | But after ALOT of research on this the CR-V the Rav4 and the Forester the Santa Fe blew them away | I was impressed with how far Hyundai has come | It's no longer the high rent Yugo it's now the low rent Lexus | 
 "words": Driven AWD SE for 6 month 6000 miles | Ownership experience has been great with no problems | Before purchase did a lot of magazine and internet research | Except for expensive luxury SUVs test drove all small and mid-size SUVs on same road course with mix of freeway and hilly curvy streets and surface streets purposely with rough pavement and potholes | For drivability and comfort narrowed choice down to Santa Fe Nissan Acura and Ford Edge | After negotiating price Santa Fe blew the others away | For SUV drives well on freeways and mountain roads | Very smooth quiet and comfortable ride | Seats are comfortable | Mileage in-town around 18 | highway 19-20 | 
 "words": Our 1st SUV- not used to hopping up into it | For the price warranty it seems to be a good choice | Compared with Ford Escape CRV RAV 4 and others | Needs some thins added- HUD P3 interior lightingetc
 "words": We looked at the Toyota Rav4 GMC Envoy and Honda Pilot and this is the best of all of those | There are so many thoughtful features in it that I've been discovering for the past 2 weeks | It has lighted cup holders when your head lights are on a gasoline sensor so the air in the cabin doesn't have gas in it and the Mp3 capibilities | The ride is a bit rough but the leather seats comphensate for that | Getting leather at 26400 is a great buy | The wheels may cost a lot of money to replace though | This Santa Fe blows its older model away with better looks better interior and better fit and finish | One word of caution The limited AWD w 5 seats only is very rare so look around
 "words": nearing 700 miles in 3 weeks | It's great surpasses my expectations | Just as a frame of reference our other car is a 2007 Avalon Limited | The Santa Fe is very nearly as quiet | Santa Fe steering is quicker ratio thus feels very nimble fun to drive Very easy to park | All controls intuitive | Ride is reaonably smooth only sign | bumps register but remember I'm spoiled by the Avalon | COmpared to many other SUV's I've riden in the Santa Fe is genuinely most car like in ride | Drags our 2700 boat up the ramps easily way easier than our former car | Back storage room is very practical | We love it | Don't buy anything until you've tested a Santa Fe | 
 "words": This vehicle handles more like a fine tuned sport sedan rather than a mid sized SUV | So far with just a few hundred miles on it my gasoline mileage is at about 19 with most of it being highway speeds | I think this will improve over time | 
 "words": I bought the CUV this June and love the way that it drives compared to my 10 year old Dodge Durango | More zip much better mileage with more HP 242 vs 230 | I love the XM radio feature | Good A C chills quick Aluminum engine warms up much quicker than my old 5 | 2 V8 |

 "words": When my wife and I decided to buy a small SUV as a 3rd vehicle we first looked at the Hyundai Tucson | We liked it a lot but decided to also look at the Santa Fe | We were immediately impressed and after checking out all competitors we bought our Limited AWD with XM and Premium Package fresh off the truck | After 1 month and 1500 miles I can say positively that the Santa Fe is a wonderful SUV | It's comfortable well-built and every bit as enjoyable to drive as our former Volvo XC90 | The Santa Fe has the feel of a much more expensive vehicle | There are no rattles or squeaks and everything has a solid feel to it | I'm a car guy and this Hyundai has not disappointed me | 
 "words": Have had the Santa Fe for about a month | Love the way it drives | Wish my wife would let me drive it more often | 
 "words": WOW is all I can say researched the several other SUV's and the SantaFe has surpast my expectations in every category | Exterior has a sleek look | Interior is very well designed and looks great | Roomie 3 row seating great with the kids and a smooth ride | Sleek design and all the extra's at an afforable price | Getting better gas mileage than expected 20 city 24 highway | I look forward to driving this car everyday |

 "words": Found that we needed a vehicle to replace our aging mini-van and since we live where it does snow wanted something with either all wheel or 4 wheel drive | Compared a Honda CR-V and the RAV4 with the Hyundai Santa Fe | It ended up being no contest | The Hyundai in the SE trim level is loaded with safety convience comfort items | We also qualified for special financing which clinched the deal | The redesign of the Santa Fe has created a beautiful looking vehicle both inside and out | I had a guy think it was a Lexus | And if you're considering a SUV check out the Santa Fe especially in the Dark Cherry Red which is what we got it's stunning |

 "words": I leased my new Hyudai Sante Fe in April of 2007 | Everything about the comfort style performace and practicality of the verhicle is excellent | except for the gas milage | I had previoiusly been driving a Buick Rendevous and the Sante Fe was advertised as similar gas mileage | But my expereince has been far below that estimate | I am averaging only 15 miles per gallon in the city and 18 on the highway | This has been a big disappointment | I'm glad I only leased and not purchased this SUV | The sad part is if I DID get closer to the advertised gas milage this would be the perfect vehicle for me and I would purchase it |
