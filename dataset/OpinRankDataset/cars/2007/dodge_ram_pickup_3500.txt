 "words": I drove one of these truck brand new owned by Chrysler Corp | pulling a show trailer all across America on the Jeep Go anywhere Do Anything Tour | The trailer I pulled was 50' long had a show vehicle show engines etc | and was extremely heavy | I don't remember the exact weight now | I went through the Appalachians Rockies took on headwinds across the deserts and plains went through death Valley where the temps | were 115 F plus | This truck did a great job I thought | The fuel mileage considering the load I was pulling was a very acceptable 12 mpg and about 18 when I was unhooked | I zipped around all the major cities with no problems Nav system was the best feature for finding ANYTHING | 
 "words": I am a transporter of RV trailers | Original truck was a '99 Ford | Engine blew 613k | Purchased Dodge only because of the Cummins engine | Mistake | Should have replaced the engine in the Ford | When you spend 8 to 10 hours a day behind the wheel you need comfort and predictability of functions | Remove speed sensor from the wipers | Cancel cruise when the brake pedal is touched | Turn off stop lights when driver removes foot from brake pedal to release trailer brakes especially when on ice Heater controls and flash to pass need more feel | I have had problems with the new emissions | Been to the dealer 13 times for a sensor on the DPF |

 "words": I have been with Ford for many years but have always been a fan of I6 engine design over V8 diesels | So I decided to give Dodge a chance | So far I am very pleased with the entire vehicle | Very quiet and ride is good considering it's a one ton great power 6 | 7 Cummins smooth trans | 3 | 73 and 6-speed seems to be a great combination | Lots of low end grunt and a nice flat torque curve | 6501500 to 2800 | Build quality is very good | I live on a dirt washboard road and no rattles | amazing | Exterior paint and finish are excellent | Dollar value I feel was best compaired to Chevy GM and Ford | I would recommend anyone to test drive before buying any other make |
