REVIEWS
 "words": I have owned this car for 2 years and have had absolutely zero problems with it | It does 0 to 60 in 9 seconds plenty fast enough for me and has a magnificent ride | I have had several complements from total strangers on how beautiful it looks I have the blacked out grill with ming blue | The aluminum wheels are nice | Anybody who compares this car with an Avalon or Azela | or Ford Taurus Mercury Sable is completely out of their mind | My only complaint is the fuel mileage I get 26 on the open road not as good as the 29 I got with my 2000 LeSabre | 
 "words": Sometimes it feels like the only way I could get the gas mileage to be better is if I pushed it with the engine off | I cannot get this over 21mpg I am not an aggressive driver | I set the cruise between 65 and 70 yet still the avg MPG never goes above 21 on the highway Sometimes I feel that I should have bought the V8 at least I would have had some power with my cruddy gas mileage or I may have even gotten better mileage with the V8 | Why did GM kill the 3 | 8 | 2000 LeSabre had 15 more hp better torque and 33mpg on the highway | What why did they change it | 
 "words": The car gives 28 miles per gallon | The seats are very uncomfortable | We have to use cushions to drive it | Can't see the speedometer in the daytime | It should be brighter still a nice car | Trunk could be bigger
 "words": Car was a dealer demo | I was sold based on a test drive | It was and remains very quiet and luxurious feeling in that aspect | However the driver's seat left side molding cracked and broke of its own accord with a quarter-sized piece popping off and landing in the driver's foot well | Now two weeks later it seems like the entire driver's door interior panel is trying to separate from the metal with a give of at least an inch when closing the door | Two months ago the OnStar stopped working on its own and took 3 tries to fix | Handling feels weird at 45 mph like Cruise is taking over on its own | Very disappointing all around and I wish I could have my Chrysler 300 back | 
 "words": I have owned many cars in my life but this Buick has almost everything from the OnStar to a custom paint job | The comfort level is perfect and my mileage is 17 city 33 hwy | I can't wait to buy one for my wife | 
 "words": This is not my 95 Roadmaster but I didn't expect it to be | Mileage is a little disappointing with the 6 cylinder 17-19 city 28 | 5 30 | 6 Highway excellent fit and finish like the driver info center | plenty of leg room | head room when entering could be better |

 "words": I own a 2003 Buick Park Avenue and I bought the 2007 Lucerne CXL in February 2008 as a retirement vehicle | It only took one 400 mile trip to make me appreciate my Park Avenue and be glad that I did not sell or trade it | I love the way the Lucerne handles on a rainy road | however the seats are not comfortable the gas mileage is poor the entry and exiting process is a torture for me at 6' 2'' and left turns and parking are a chore | My long road trips will continue to be made in the Park Avenue | My wife can drive the Lucerne around town | I will only buy another Buick if they improve on the issues mentioned | 
 "words": Bought new | Classy looks smooth and quiet ride fun to drive | Satisfied with gas mileage e | g | 31mpg on highway and 19 | 5mpg suburban driving | Blind spots at center and front roof supports | DIC extremely helpful | Dimming mirror great for night time driving | Front seat lumbar supports too high | 'Had to buy seat pillows for driver and front passenger seats | Rear seats slanted too sharply making it hard to get out | especially for elderly | OnStar system easy to use | Only one repair was needed in 14 months steering | 
 "words": Bought this car new over a year ago | Love the design smoothness quietness of ride | Get 18 | 5-20 | 5 mpg suburb driving and 27-31 mpg on trips | Reasonable pickup | Arrive at distant destinations rested | Somewhat difficult getting in and out especially for elderly | Seating comfortable but non- adjustable lumbar support too high I'm 5'lland seat seems short front to back | A 2 1 2 seat pillow corrected the lumbar problem | Roof supports create dangerous blind spots that took six eight months to accommodate | Inside trunk release button awkwardly located | After 14000 miles no mechanical problems | 
 "words": Bought this car one year old when my Avalon started acting up down in Florida | Drove 800 miles one day heading North never could have driven that far with my Avalon and the horrible seats | This Lucerne is far superior to my old Avalon | Have had new Caddy's Saabs and my Toyota Avalon this is by far the best car I have owned | 
 "words": The Lucerne CXS is a very quiet comfortable sedan with decent handling | The ride is soft smooth but predictable | We and other riders are impressed with GM's OnStar performance as well | Seats are comfortable and infinitely adjustable for tall or short drivers | The NorthStar V8 under the hood is a GEM delivering quietsmooth solid power | You get a Cadillac in sheep's clothing with the CXS | Road trips are a pleasure | 
 "words": Just turned 25000 miles today | The computer says I should need my third oil change at around 30000 miles | So far two oil changes have been 100 of all repairs and maint | Has not been to the dealer since the day I picked it up | How many Lexus owners can say that | While almost no one knows what it is the styling is a little too bland all agree it looks inside and out like a modern luxury sedan | Love the sound of the Northstar with dual exhaust | Even with my less than gental driving I average over 19 mpg | With 3 | 25 gas I guess I would probably buy the v-6 if I had to do it again however | 
 "words": Bought this as a left over and got a good deal | We replaced our 98 Regal GS with this car and have not been thrilled with the mpg | The dealer tells us everything is working fine and there is nothing to fix the estimates are based on an outdated criteria that is not realistic | We are averaging less than 20 mpg combined highway city | Even on long trips we do not see an appreciable gain | Otherwise the car is well made quiet and very comfortable bench seat in front and at 6'4 that is saying something | For the first 1000 miles there was an annoying vibration int he front during breaking but as the dealer predicted this has gone away
 "words": As a long time Park Ave owner I was spoiled | This Lucerne is no Park Ave | Window sticker showed 28 mpg highway and I have not gotten close to that 26 | 3 is best I have gotten and mostly 24 to 25 mpg | On the '04 Park Ave on the same trips I would get 31 to 32 mpg | Same engine they say but Buick says they changed the gear ratio and I ask why and get no answer | I find it difficult to get in and out of and the head room is poor | My next car will not be a Buick Lucerne unless they improve on the fuel economy | 
 "words": This is not my father's buick | We switched from a Mercury product due to styling leg room rear seat room | I am 6'-6 tall and this gives me the room | We can manage about 29MPG on the open road and about 21MPG every day driving all with regular gas | It has been mistaken for a Lexus ES350 on several occassions | 
 "words": Prior to the purchase of the new 2007 Buick Allure CXL Lucerne in the US I noted a vibration in the steering and seat at 60 70 mph | I was informed by the dealer this would be taken care of | After a wheel balance and replacement of tires the vibration did not disappear | I am not satisfied after paying over 38000 | 00 and expect GM to correct the problem | This is my 5th or 6th Buick purchase and I have never encountered this before | The console cup holder design | inside storage | storage at the back of the front seat storage has been greatly limited from previous models | The right hand windshield wiper does not clear road smudge very well | The ride is much quieter and smoother | 
 "words": I love my new Lucerne however I do find it a little difficult to get in and out of | Wish the trunk open button was is a move conivent place believe this has been changed for 2008 | Wish there was a lock on gas door | Open from inside of car and find it hard to use ATM from car | 
 "words": I have found that My Lucerne CSX is one of my better purchases from my previous GM cars | I have been compimented about my Lucerne | I have had people that have commented on the ride the quiteness the sport car type handling | I just say with the price of gas today | It is the only drawback in as far of not getting good gas mileage | But one has to expect that when you have 275 horses to pull you around | All in all I would recommend the Buick Lucerne to all those that would be considering a Japanese equivelent | Quailty performance price and better warranty than those from the Pacific rim | No contest | 
 "words": I have purchased several new Ford Taurus' and one used Lincoln LS since 1988 | The 2004 Lincoln LS does not have enough leg room in the back and even though it had bumper to bumper a wheel bearing drum and 3 rims were replaced | Also a recall with a problem in the steering column I lost all confidence and decided to go with GM | We purchased the last new 2007 CXL Lucerne after test driving the 2008 Sable and Taurus | The Buick felt safer and is built better | With the OnStar and other nice features including the depreciation differencewe are glad to have a well built comfortable and dependable car | 
 "words": I love cars and I am considered a car nut by everyone that knows me | I have owned over thirty cars and have driven countless more in my persuit of the perfict one for me | I never make a purchase without very extensive investigation | If anyone ever told me that my favorite car would be a Buick I would instantly recommend they seek professional counseling | The 2007 Buick Lucerne CXL is dollar for dollar pound for pound the best inexpensive 23000 car I have ever owned | There is nothing on the market today that even comes close for the price | I know because I drove everything in the price range of under 30000 including Nissan Toyota Honda Chevy Ford and Chrysler | The car is irresistable
 "words": Bought it because it was pretty and felt comfortable | After a week of driving to and from work 40 miles per day my lower back began to hurt | After three weeks I was unable to drive the car | Driver and passenger seats have no lumbar support | Back seat is comfortable | Traded cars with my husband | He now has to drive with cushions on back of seat | Dealer was of no help | They recommended having an upholsterer rebuild the seats which we will try | We like the very quiet ride and many of the features | Headliner is of poor design with raw edges front and back | Cup holder design is poor | 
 "words": Dollar for dollar this car is the best in its class | I purchased a base model for about 23000 and at that price none of the other vehicles mentioned was even close in ride power or equipment | The Chrysler 300 in that price range is incredibly spartan in the interior and has a seriously underpowered 2 | 7L V6 | While the 300 and Toyota handle better this is clearly due to both vehicles' wider stance and lower profile tires which necessarily create a rougher ride | If the owner simply wants a powerful quiet smooth riding car rather than one which will take exit ramps at 60 mph the Lucerne is it | 
 "words": With a few exceptions the Lucerne is a fantastic automobile | It drives and rides like a dream and is the quietest vehicle I have ever ridden in | The drawbacks visability is poor can't see where the front or rear is in the case of parking windows too high obstructing visibility in tight parking areas can't see parking slot markings | Don't campare vehicle with it's competition in close proximity because the rough sounding 3800 V6 just doesn't sound like something coming from a real classy car | Gas mileage is also 6 to 7 MPG less than my 03 Lesaber with same engine trans etc | Softer leather on the seats would also help | Even with these problems it's a fine road car | 
 "words": When making a left turn the side view mirror and the wide A pillar block your view of the road | Car was delivered with a faulty Body Control Module computer resulting in intermittent error messages | My 2001 Park gave a smoother ride | Fit and finish were very good | Complex electronic driver controls are difficult to masteresspecially for seniors | 
 "words": I cannot get rid of the vibration and the seats are uncomfortable | The cooled seats only cool a small portion | The rear of the car looks like a10000 car not a 35000 car
 "words": The seats are too small and the seats do not cool as they should | The entry and exit system is a laugh | The only real problem I have had is vibration | I took it back to the dealer but it did not help | It is not a good buy at 33000 | 
 "words": Owned this vehicle for a week now | Great ride | Quiet cabin interior | Has all the options that I was looking for in a luxury car | It is like I am riding on air | Engine is quiet and I barely notice it only in high exceleration | Ride is smooth and car handles well in traffic | Recently JDP has given this 2007 Buick Lucerne a favorable quality rating with Lexus | No problem operating the features of the car and | handles well on the highway and | so far good milege in the city | Some consumers have made quality complaints about their car and I have yet to experience them | Overall so far no lemon here | Again for me this is a fine luxury car not at the high end price | 
 "words": Traded in 1999 Park Avenue Ultra | I have bought many new cars in the last 40 years | This Lucerne I feel is by far the finest one of all | Great comfort good fuel ecomy | Took trip with crise on and got 27 | 5 miles to the gallon | A very enjoyable car to own and drive | Extremely quiet and a joy to drive | 
 "words": I have had SUVs for the past 10 years the ride from my CXL is impressive | The standard features in the CXL are admirable | I am not impressed with the fuel economy at this point in time | A well constructed quality auto | 
 "words": I have had the car only 600 miles and today as I opened the front driver side door the door handle pulled out of the door frame | It took me a good while to try to get it back in so that I could get into the car | I finally did but have no idea whether the same thing will happen again | I have just had it into the dealer to repair a dent in the make ready opearation and hate to think about having it tied up for another long trip to the dealer | Are others having trouble indicating such sloppy workmanship | Such a mishap makes me wonder whether I can trust the car or not | The so-called cool seats do not cool much of the seat | 
 "words": For once a hasty decision on my part turned out good | Upon leaving my sister's home after a two week visit and having my old car all packed to return to Florida it wouldn't start | I'd had problems with it before | Sister screams at me to buy a new car | I remembered my nephew a day earlier telling me about the Buick Lucerne | A car with class and enough room for my 6'5 frame | I dismissed his opinion | I've never thoughtabout owning a Buick | Sister dialed a family friend and handed me the phone | Turned out to be a salesman for the Buick dealer I was so stressed i told him to work me a deal and he did | a Lucerne | The return trip to Florida was fantastic | I love the car | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Lucerne | I've had foreign and domestic cars but decided to come back to American made cars | I researched and compared approx 5 vehicles before chosing the Lucerne and all of my friends and family love it as well | I get told from teenagers that it's a hot car all the way to people in their 70's plus who just love it | Out of all the cars I've owned | and that's been many this is my very very favorite | I wish I could buy one for everyone I know so they could have as much fun as I do | It's like driving a Cadillac on a smart budget | You get all the comfort bells and whistles while being able to keep some money in your pocket | Go Buick | You did great | 
 "words": I finally relented and traded in our 1998 Aurora with 105000 miles | It had virtually no problems | I did not want a Cadillac yet and will never buy an import vehicle | With Oldsmobile gone I turned to Buick and leased a black 2007 Lucerne CXS with the Cadillac Northstar 4 | 6 litre V8 | The Buick now has three Wildcat badges from the 1968 version and has the style to go with the name | GM should have brought back a name like Wildcat rather than Lucerne | In California a Lucerne is a half gallon of milk from Safeway not a county in Switzerland | 
 "words": This is not a Park Avenue | Was told by salesman this was the replacement | The car is not very comfortable at all | after about 45mins your lower back rear end really start to ache | Lent the car to my secretary she made the same comment | Have also had the front air deflector fall off 3 times at highway speeds which Buick will not replace as a warranty item | Finally tore it off and just drive without it | Heated seats work well but the AC seat function cools about a 3x8 inch strip of the seat near your crotch nothing more | If you want a car for long drives look elsewhere

 "words": Originally considering a smaller sedan I went out and compared estimated mileage and prices | Honda Nissan Toyota and Volkswagen came up short on the quality and attractiveness end and did not offer substantial mileage savings when models were compared head-to-head on power and price | My CXL has high-end stereo great looking leather sunroof remote start and is one of the best looking sedans on the road | Ranks with BMW and Cadillac on looks for the price of an ugly Japanese car | 
 "words": We love our new Lucerne except for the air noise that comes in through the windows | We purchased it for fuel economy comfort and the advertised guarantee of quietness | We average about 24 MPG on the road and it is comfortable | But the door window design must be flawed because the air noise that comes through the windows at speeds over 45 mph is awful | It is like driving in a wind tunnel | The dealership promises to replace the gaskets around both of the front doors so we hope that this helps | Just make sure that you test drive on a highway where you can drive over 45 MPH before you buy this vehicle | 
 "words": When driving during the day without lights the three dials on the instrument panel are dark | I just came back from the dealer and he tells me that's the way it is | My wife's Toyota Camry instrument panel lights up during the day | The bottom half of the center dial lights but the top half with the speedometer numbers is dark | The guage on the right with fuel level etc is completely dark | So is the RPM guage but I don't need that | I can't believe that the 2007 Lucerne has been designed this way | Had I noticed this during the driving test I wouldn't have bought it |

 "words": I replaced a 2004 Park Avenue with a 2007 Lucerne big mistake | The Lucerne is far smaller than a Park Avenue | The interior is a joke | It is so cheaply done as soon as you sit in it for a month you begin to feel like your setting in a Kia | Buick made their first mistake back in 1996 when they dropped the Roadmaster and now they have really gone looney by dropping the Park Avenue | The interior room in the Lucerne is so small I felt like I was in a circus car and clowns should have been in there with me | Go with a Lincoln Town Car | The Lucerne is a big mistake treat yourself with a true luxury car go with the Lincoln Town Car | 
 "words": Buick Lucerne CXL was the best quality and greatest value | I drove the Cadillac's Acura TL Chrysler 300 both Toyota sedans and even the Azera | This sedan is loaded with extras provides great fit and finish and is truely and luxury car | I researched every car and read the reviews but I think if the car is not an import the published reviews are not as good | I now belive the car press is not open minded about the American made cars | This sedan is worth a drive and you will be surprised at the quality and features |

 "words": Puchased 31 of October | Week later antifreeze spilled all over the road | Brought back for service | They replaced thermostat and gasket | Found gas pedal and steering wheel vibrates like a cell phone in vibration mode when going uphill | Four times in dealership no result | Still vibrates | Dealer replaced motor mounts 2 times | Finaly he gave up and indicated that this is design of the car and nothing can be done | My foot going numb after 2 hours of driving | Going to return this car under lemon law | Very disapointed with Buick | Never buy Buick again | 
 "words": Shortly after taking possesion of our Lucerne we noticed that the headliner in the front right section was sagging | Dealer inspected the problem and said the headliner had to be replaced since the warp in the headliner could not be repaired | It was also noticed that the headliner felt had rawor frayed and exposed edges both in the front and rear | Certainly not a very finished look | To replace the headliner the dealership had to remove and replace the front windshield to enable them to get the new headliner into to car | 
 "words": Great auto | I get 32 mpg with great comfort and security | Why buy foreign | More value than competion | 
 "words": If a quiet comfortable ride is priority one Lucerne CX will exceed expectations | Built on the same platform as Cadillac DTS it isolates the driver from minor road problems while Avy Azera do not | The Buick engineers have found the perfect balance between ride comfort and control in the CX model | For those who favor control over comfort the CXL has 17 tires and a firmer suspension yet delivers a great ride that is not harsh | Auto Level is standardall models and enhances the ride with any kind of load | The engine and transmission smootly deliver performance as neededquietly and without a hint of the hesitation mentioned in other new cars | Highway mileage is 30 MPG 
 "words": I absolutly love the car | It's great looking and handles like a dream in the mountains | Gas milage is wonderful for a car this size over 20 in town and over 30 on the road and I dont baby it | I did put red line oil products in it like i do everything I drive but the car is in my opinion just great | I've had 6 Caddys Devilles and this car will not only beat them in a race but I think it's more comfortable and is aproximately 20000 msrp cheaper so how good is that | What a value | 
 "words": I replaced an E class Mercedes with a Buick Lucerne due to the poor reliability of the Mercedes | The Buick drives as well as the Mercedes with on road mileage almost as good | Only two features of the Buick bother me the rather large turning circle and the total lack of style of the rear of the car | Other than that I am very satisfied with the car | 
 "words": This is a great road car fun to drive and very quiet inside | The seats are very comfortable | Not much left to wish for in a car of this price range | A lot of bang for your buck | 
 "words": My 2007 CX Buick has a lot of wind noise starting at 45 MPH | I have driven several and all have some degree of noise but mine is the worst | The fix is turn the radio on | 
 "words": I just purchased the Lucerne and it is a great car | I test drove all the different models and the CXS is not even comparible to the others | Its drive far surpasses the lower models and drives like a dream | The V-8 is not going to beat up the muscle cars but it's not supposted to either | It is very smooth and runs great | 
 "words": My only disappointment is that the city mileage and I drive conservatively is only 17 vs the 21 I got from my 2000 LeSabre | Highway driving is about 27 | A nice car to own and drive |
