REVIEWS
 "words": This is actually my wife's car | I drive it about once or twice a week | The car now has 55K miles and the problems or complaints that I want to mention are the lack of power when the AC is on and the knocking that comes from the steering column linkage | The power is expected because it's a 4 cylinder | The linkage problem is a flaw that has received a technical notice but no recall | Very frustrating that Toyota won't recall this and fix a potentially dangerous problem | Otherwise a very good car and excellent for your wife to use for work or kid hauling | 
 "words": I experienced a windshield tick soon as I purchased the vehicle | Toyota service attempted a fix and it got worse | The tick was intermittent and after several trips to the dealer and test drives the dealer resealed the windscreen | The problem resurfaced recently | The dealers are unable to diagnose and fix it | My 36000 mile warranty is expiring | There is also a rattle around the dash on the passenger side | Toyota is unable to diagnose that problem as well | I occasionally hear other noises and vibrations as well in the interior from the sun roof area and around the passenger door | Toyota replaced defective sun visors and the glove compartments | The radio display mysteriously would go blank | 
 "words": We got our RAV4 in 7 2007 and since then we haven't have any problem at all | There are two areas where the 2007 design failed 1 The rear bumper upper part is too exposed to scratches during loading unloading | 3 At winter ice forms between the spare tire and the rear bumper | That ice eventually tends to damage the rear bumper | 2 the spare tire cover was removed during a car wash and totally ruined | Someone mentioned that TOYOTA said only they know of one case | that is simply not true it is pretty common and a big design flaw | After 2007 they changed the design of the car cover | 
 "words": Our Rav4 problem is that the engine6cyl starts to whine at 40mph and continues at higher speeds although it is somewhat less obvious due to wind and road noise | I have never seen a review where an owner is concerned about this problem | Dealer says no technical notes from Toyota | Looks like we dump the car | 
 "words": Bought this new in 2007 | It has 36000 on it now | At 26K had to replace all 4 tires | They are 17 tires and the dealer wanted us to pay 800 dollars to get it inspected | I bought them at a tire place for half | They said it was normal on Rav 4's that the stock tire wears out by 25K miles | The 30K maintenance cost us almost 400 dollars and I'm not really sure why | I get carsick in it if I'm not driving same thing with my wife | My kid gets carsick on long trips as well | At 36000 miles the check engine light came on accompanied by a light that said VSC and the 4X4 light too | Took it in and had to replace the coil | Paid 109 dollars for diagnosis | Also hard to tell if 4WD is on or not | 
 "words": Coming soon to a recall near you the external VVTi rubber hose of the 3 | 5L engine fails spraying quarts of oil all throughout the engine compartment | This is a very common problem in Toyota's 3 | 5L lineup and potentially affects Avalon Camry and Rav4 | Engine seizures are a possibility | Toyota has redesigned this rubber hose as a steel hose for 2009 models but hasn't done much of anything for current 2006 2007 and 2008 owners | This line broke at 45000 miles for me | For other owners it broke outside of the power train warranty | Many Rav4s have needed short block replacement due to this defect | 
 "words": This SUV is nimble and quick | It is still fun to drive after 2 years and 30K miles | The gas mileage even for the V6 is great usually 22-23 mpg in mixed driving and 27-28 hwy | Acceleration literally blows anything else off the road and almost stops on a dime | It handles like it's on tracks | I have not had any mechanical issues with the vehicle | The one thing it needs however is a mounting bracket for the front license plate | In a 2- plate state like this one that can be a problem | 
 "words": I have owned many Toyota 4Runner Camry this is the third one and the last one quality control has been an issue for my Rav4 | There were quite a lot squeeze noise on the plastic part in the interior even when it's brand new | Spent some time to fix them | Now second year the vehicle won't be able to start every 5 to 7 days | It's not battery for sure | It could be security system starter spark dealers yes I tried two Toyota dealers won't fix it because they can't duplicate the error so they can't fix it | Oh by the way the audio system display started to not show anything or strange Japanese characters | If you press the panel really hard it fixes the problem | 
 "words": Just like the post from Deb on 05 05 2009 last month my 2007 Toyota rav 4 with v6 and 38000 kms had its vvt hose break spraying oil in engine compartment but no engine light came on | Caused engine failure | Had to replace the engine wasn't easy but they did it under warranty after pushing them hard | 
 "words": I used to love this car | I ordered it specifically | We own several Toyotas | After only 37000 miles I had a VVT hose leak spraying the car engine and making loud grinding sound | The dealer will not examine the valves or open the drip pan | I have found this is more common than Toyota is letting on | Toyota has only replaced the hose 60000 power train warranty and will not agree to look for any damage that may have occurred | The warning light does not come on until the oil is gone and the engine is frozen | Horrible combination | Hope this helps someone else avoid this situation | 
 "words": I needed more room than my 4 door sedan provided but I didn't want a large gas sucking SUV | The RAV4 is perfect for my family's needs we already have a minivan | The ride is very nice reasonably quiet and it holds the road well | The power of the 3 | 5 liter V6 is great and I've been averaging 23 | 5 mpg in mixed driving over the 3000 miles I've driven the car | It seems to get between 25 and 28 mpg on the highway and between 17 and 19 around town | The third seat fits our 5 year old well and since it's a 50-50 split the dog can sit next to him in the back while the 2-year-old twins are quite happy in the middle row | Highly recommend | Great car | 
 "words": It's one the fastest SUVs you can buy it can go 0-60 in under 7 seconds | It is also a great example why horsepower isn't everything | You hit the gas pedal on your RAV4 | Front wheels start to spin | Traction control light comes up | The entire vehicle leans backwards | Finally it lunges ahead shaking and ignoring the steering wheel input | There's a lot of passing power but the vehicle is not designed for high-speed turns and does not feel confident above 80-85 mph | If you're interested in RAV4 V6 because of its power Sport edition 4WD might be a better choice | There's no cure for high center of gravity but stiffer suspension and proper drivetrain should help a bit | 
 "words": Just got it 2 weeks ago | Very very happy with it | With the V6 it's very fast | Getting 24 mpg in the city haven't calculated highway yet | This vehicle is a happy medium of sportiness and practicality | Cupholders in front are kinda awkward | 
 "words": I highly recommend this vehicle | I purchased the V6 Limited 4WD with leather all accessories | Competition was the Honda CR-V which was finally no competition | Toyota V6 engine is effortless and power is remarkable | 5-speed transmission is smooth quiet unobtrusive | Transmission does not hunt | With V6 engine there is some torque steer not much compared to other 270 HP engines | Interior is quiet | leather stitching is precise | beware rear door is very heavy | HVAC is excellent | Real world MPG first few tanksful of gas 24 | 0 24 | 6 23 | 2 and 26 | 1 | Conditions Fresno 95 to 106 degree heat air conditioning some freeway some street | Be very judicious with throttle | 4wheel discs excellent | 
 "words": The V6 3 | 5L engine has a lot of get up and go making it easy to pass other cars and get out of trouble situations | The steering is very easy to handle | The interior leg room fits my wife's size very comfortably | 
 "words": We took delivery two days ago and we just completed our new vehicle's first road trip | After 400 miles in all types of driving I am happy to report that our new RAV4 meets or exceeds every expectation that we had | I've seen several reviews that cited poor front seat comfort but after two and a half hours each way in the driver's seat I didn't feel the slightest bit of fatigue | The front seats could stand to slide back another inch or so and they maybe could use more side bolstering on the seatbacks but overall they are very comfortable | Fuel economy for the first tank came in at 24 mpg which I find spectacular in light of the available power | In short it's a great ride | 
 "words": I just purchased this vehicle last month and so far I'm really enjoying it | I previously had a Honda CR-V but was unable to buy another one because we are stationed in Germany and they don't get CR-Vs at the American dealerships here | I settled for the RAV4 but so far I like it a lot | It's a little bit bigger than my CR-V but not so big that I have trouble parking it or navigating down narrow streets | We got the third-row seat option which I think will come in handy when we start a family or have guests | Not too noisy when driving 80 mph down the Autobahn | One thing I don't like is a very large blind spot on driver side between windshield and driver door | 
 "words": I bought my sport edition in Feb | and have never been happier with a new car purchase | I wasn't going to get the 6 cyl | but am glad I did as I really like the power for freeway driving | It has a lot of room and is really comfortable for road trips | I was looking to buy the Honda CR-V but as I couldn't get the one I wanted I am totally glad I ended up with the RAV4 | I love the Bluetooth feature also which the Honda doesn't offer | I couldn't be happier with my purchase of the RAV4 | 
 "words": I love our RAV4 | We were torn between the CRV because it doesn't have the ugly rear tire but the CRV has no V6 option and was way too slow | The interior of the RAV4 is much nicer | Not getting as good MPG as expected 21-24 MPG | 
 "words": I have owned my car for over a year now | Overall I like it a lot | I had to have an SUV but it is just too large for me | Anyhow I love the pick up and speed | It is excellent in the rain absolutely sticks to the ground | Also very good in snow unless you try and go through the UP of MI forget it it felt like the car went into rear wheel drive mode | Scary but for every day IL driving with some snow it is fine | I hate the amber lights | With sunglasses on I cannot read the console | I will never get a car with amber lights again | 
 "words": I really enjoy my 2007 RAV4 | The ride is extremely smooth with a car-like feel | The exterior gives a sleek handsome look which makes the RAV4 look like a real SUV unlike say the Honda CR-V or Nissan Murano | 4-cyl engine has enough power to get me going on the freeway yet it is quiet enough at high speeds where I can have a quiet conversation | Gas mileage is outstanding I'm averaging 25-26 mpg with mixed driving roughly 28-30 on the highway | All around for the look performance handling and cost I cannot imagine a better mid-sized SUV on the market today | 
 "words": I upgraded from a well-loved Matrix mainly because I needed the extra space for dogs and teenage nieces nephews | I've only had the car 2 weeks but so far it is wonderful | Aside from mpg it definitely is living up to expectations | The vehicle stability control makes it more controllable in a crosswind than my Matrix | 
 "words": Just passed 10000 mile mark | Gas mileage not 29 mpg like sticker says more like 21-22 mpg | Finally adjusted tires so ride not so bumpy | Humming noise at 40 mph is almost unbearable | Dealer says it's normal | Drove other RAV4s and heard the same noise | I love everything else about my RAV but don't know how much longer I can stand the noise | 
 "words": A really good ride for an SUV | Great MPG average about 25-26 and plenty of power for a 4 cylinder | Lots of room in front and back seats | Lots of cargo space and storage areas | Great value for all you get with base model | 
 "words": I didn't have much time to cross-shop so I just followed public opinion before I picked my RAV4 | It was completely a disaster | Fuel economy is nowhere close to the EPA number | The engine made so bothering noise and finally stalled | I just put this car on sale and hope somebody just buys it quickly | 
 "words": Audible beeps when merely locking unlocking doors is EXTREMELY annoying | It sounds like car thief alarm | Gas mileage is horrible not even getting the minimum | No leg room for driver I'm 6'1 with the electronic seat | 
 "words": Test drove the 4wd and 2wd versions and after all was said and done the 2wd sold me | It was just smoother and felt more precise | When you live in socal you dont really need 4wd I guess | Overall quality performance and build is just superior for a car that is just under 30k | No issues with noise rattling comfort or performance | I also have a 2005 4Runner and this RAV4 totally beats it hands down | I'm selling my 4Runner tomorrow | 
 "words": This car is great to look at but the ride is very truck-ish | I used to drive a 1999 Sienna mini-van which I loved | I thought this would be just as good | This car has more road noise and the seats are way to firm | The backseats are right next to the rear wheelwell and quite noisy on a rainy day | This vehicle could use some plushness | I have had this car for 6 months and am trading it in for a 2007 Sienna not financially prudent | The interior of my mom's 2004 Highlander is much nicer | 
 "words": I have had my car for more than four months yet I get the same feelings I had initially when I first test drove it | It is a comfortable and smooth ride | I have no regrets and look forward to a long and rich driving experience | 
 "words": Have driven 17000 miles | Day to day driving it only gets 23 mpg | EPA estimates 24 to 30 mpg | Seats not very comfortable on drives over 40 or 50 miles | Rides rough you feel every bump | There is a large blind spot on both rear corners | Don't like large swinging rear door | The 4 cyl engine takes a lot of pedal to get the vehicle moving | Get the V6 | I won't buy another | 
 "words": I have a 2007 v6 auto Rav 4 | Color is Flint Mica | Great style great color | I have had it for 4 months and 5600 miles | Great SUV to drive | Transmission is not as smooth as my Titan | Seats could be a little more comfortable | The only thing that bothers me is the mysterious humming sound it makes | It's not the fan kicking on | The dealership could not duplicate | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota and so far I am very pleased with it | Traded in my 1999 Honda CR-V for it and it is so much bigger | Much more power and smoother ride then the Honda | Hope the longevity in quality is as good as the Honda | Amazing how little difference there is in MPG between the two seeing how the Toyota has a 6cyl engine and the Honda had a 4cyl | 
 "words": Don't get me wrong I love my Rav | I went from a nissan to this and it is a definite step up | The gas mileage isn't as high as the sticker said | There is a need for mud guards or you will have chips on the sides | I wanted a dark interior so had to settle for the sport model but really wanted the limited | But TOYOTA is still number 1 in my book | We had an '89 toyota pick up and I loved it | It is still on the road and going strong | My cousin has it now not a family vehicle after the kids got taller | I bought the extended warranty so I am good for 10 years bumper to bumper and I know the Rav will hold up for those 10 years | 
 "words": The RAV4 Ltd | 4wd V6 beats the last two Honda CRVs I have owned except for the uncomfortable front seats | My wife and I both find them very difficult to sit in when taking any trip over 1 hour | They really need to improve these seats since the car is otherwise so great | 
 "words": If you want a reasonably priced SUV that has a LOT of power and versatility look at this one | Some people may find the ride a bit rough | Unless you are shelling out BIG bucks for variable suspension there is a compromise between the responsiveness of a stiffer suspension and a smoother I can't feel the road ride | It's all about what you like | The Limited IS highly responsive but also has a reasonably smooth ride | The interior quality is good I didn't say great | and in-line with the price | The rear seats can be moved forward or back accommodating large passengers or more cargo | It's a mid-sized SUV that offers some interesting features for a reasonable cost | Go for the 6cyl version | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota | I love it so far | Been in Hyundais since 1990 | This is definitely a SERIOUS step up | Much better quality reliability styling MPG | Hope to drive the wheels off the thing | I usually keep vehicles for at least 10 years so this one should be around for awhile | 
 "words": I compared the RAV4 vs CRV and eventually got the RAV4 | The RAV4's interior feels cheap I like the CRV interior better and the CRV's top mounted rear door make more sense | But the RAV4 won me over the CRV with the V6 handling and the interior cargo space | CRV only has 52 inches while RAV4 flow flat back seat gave me 70 inches | The RAV4 has more room and is more comfortable | 
 "words": Now at about 5000 miles it has broken in nicely | To date best highway mileage is 27 MPG mixed driving hasn't dropped below 23-24 MPG | I posted a review in 12 06 many of those first impressions are still alive | General observations it works but HVAC is slow to heat the AC works fine | There is an occasional hum from the engine compartment when cruising at 50-55 MPH | The radio works well but bass is not delivered too clearly mid-radio option | Switchgear is refined high quality | Steering is well weighted but electric-motor-assist removes some steering feel | Suspension is well tuned | Vehicle doesn't drift in crosswinds | Huge cargo space | Highly recommend | 
 "words": Fuel economy is a little less than hoped for 22 25 MPG but I drive at least 70 on freeway air conditioner on much of time and I live in a hilly area so am expecting a lot for what car is put through | The iPod location is not the most convenient nor is location of power outlets | Wish rear window opened continental kit should have a locking system looks good but door opening is a bit problematic | cannot carry things longer than interior | Love rear seat adjustments and fold down configuration but middle seat is useless | Lots of power and turning radius is fabulous | Fun | Great visibility | Really like the RAV4 wish the emissions were a bit better but have a v6 so | 
 "words": I had been driving a Toyota Avalon the flagship of the Toyota line for several years | I needed a vehicle with more utility value | I researched the RAV4 on Edmunds as well as Consumer Reports websites | After an extensive test drive I purchased the RAV4 | I am still pleasantly surprised and delighted every time I drive this larger and more powerful RAV4 | The suspension is firm yet very comfortable road noise is at a minimum the steering is much more accurate than the Avalon and the fit and finish is flawless much like Toyota's Lexus products | 
 "words": Everything about this vehicle fits me | I have had all brand-new vehicles in the past | I have owned a 97 Chev Cavalier too little and poor quality sold it after 32k miles then moved to a 99 GrandPrix GTP loved it and sold it at 130k miles then I bought a 05 Acura RSX excellent quality still that sporty feel that I like but with better gas mileage then the GrandPrix engine was sorta weak however Although I was not in need of a new vehicle I decided that I needed a small SUV something I could grow with | I wanted to be able to carry camping gear my bike and a few friends and be comfortable | I frowned at the thought of buying into something under powered and lacked the sporty feel | 
 "words": The RAV4 Limited V6 rides well has good power and in most ways is a great SUV | But the front seats are AWFUL | Very very uncomfortable for both my wife and me 5'3 and 6' | Very disappointing | Previously has a CRV and the seats were comfortable for short and long trips | Great SUV but I don't know how long we can keep it since we drive 20k miles per year | 
 "words": Replaced a 2000 Subaru Forester S 5MT with this vehicle for me to drive to work for 2 years and hand off to college bound child | It is very safe secure and surprisingly fun and agile | Went with 2 | 4L engine for better mileage and to prevent my teenager and me from excessive speeding | Huge cargo area especially without 3rd row can hold all my sporting gear | Very smooth and quiet engine and cabin | Sunroof does not take up headroom | Back seat room terrific compared to Forester and averaging same MPG 25 but now with automatic much larger vehicle more features and more comfortable ride with same nimble and sporty ride | 
 "words": I love everything about my RAV4 I bought it in Feb | I find myself driving for no reason these days just to be in my car | I got the barcellonic red so when I am out I notice people looking at my RAV | It is also roomy and comfy my backseats are even bigger then that of a friends grand cherokee | 
 "words": One hour test drive was the best after 3 months of looking | 07 Rav 4 Sport has good power and performance | Interior and cargo space great | Like being able to lock in 4WD in low speed | 18 inch wheels cool | Easy to get in and out of | 
 "words": Great engine same used in some Lexus vehicles | Very fast acceleration great handleding for an SUV | Nice fuel economy mine still breaking in so I'm not getting sticker yet | It does 0-60 6 | 3s which pretty much leaves most cars in the dust | It has lots of room even with a child seat in the middle of the rear seats | I Like the tints | Nice sport rims | Nice ride not rough | 
 "words": My wife and I had been test driving cars for months | The entire time I was shying away from Toyota becase of thier vanilla reputation | You know reliable but kind of bland | Once I drove the V6 4wd sport WOW | I count myself as one of the converted | You can feel each and every one of the 269 horses | The suspension on the sport model is stiff and sporty but comfortable | Fit and finish is very solid | We drove the competition Mazda CX-7 and Honda CR-V | I liked both but neither combined the functionality and fun factor better than the RAV4 | Now that I have now driven this vehicle in varying Wisconsin weather conditions and I havent driven anything more stable in poor road conditions either | 
 "words": Been a Honda dude for the past 12 years but I traded my Odyssey in on the Rav4 mainly for an increase in MPG | We drive around 36000 miles per year and the hope of 30 MPG sounded great | We averaged 20 MPG in the Odyssey and in the first 1500 miles we are averaging 25 | 5 mpg with the Rav4 in evenly mixed city hwy driving | We test drove the Mitsubishi Outlander Honda CR-V and Jeep Liberty but the Rav4 beat them all | The Outlander was our second choice a close second choice | 
 "words": All I hoped it would be except for quality of interior materials hard plastic looks cheap | Leather does too but it isn't a Lexus | you can't have it all without paying for it | But oh the acceleration | Add a KN air filter and it's even better | Mileage is great and on 87 O to boot | Considered and drove the RDX but that thirsty turbo 4 using premium just killed the deal | Too bad the MDX the car we traded for the Rav4 was designed with the engine the RDX should have had | We have the optional pearl paint | Really looks great | The ride is better than our MDX had and this Rav4 is much more nimble | 
 "words": I wanted an SUV that gets better mileage than the big ones and still have the room for trips and hauling stuff | I tow my 2 snowmobiles so this was perfect since it will handle 3500 lbs | I have been getting about 25 mpg and have not had any problem after 6 months and 6k | It has surpassed all my expectations and is fun to drive and it gets down the road in a hurry | Highly recommend it | 
 "words": I think the Rav4 is GREAT | Fun to drive comfortable my first SUV and I am glad that I made the switch | Always been a Toyota owner and will continue to be | 
 "words": Don't hesitate to pay the extra bucks to buy the V6 | If you don't you'll wish you had | On automatics make sure you put the automatic shift lever in D not 4th gear | When a driver pulls the lever into drive the shift gate tends to lead you to 4th gear rather than D and I suspect drivers who get low mileage are doing this because the engine doesn't rev that high in 4 | When we first got the RAV4 I drove many highway miles in gear 4 without realizing it and my mileage suffered badly | 
 "words": The V6 is blast fast and responsive | MPG on first five tanks 22 | 5 23 | 5 22 | 0 23 | 0 and 24 | 5 | The 24 | 5 was a full tank at 50-80 mph the others where a mix of city and hwy | Interior is roomy well put together and very comfortable | Heated leather seats are very nice moonroof 9 spkr JBL bluetooth mp3 all add to the very nice driving experience | Although the brakes are competent they feel soft when braking from high speeds | Not enough to worry about them working or not | If you test drive one of these open the two rear passenger windows at freeway speeds | It gets loud a reason why you should consider getting the moonroof as I did | All in all well worth the money spent | 
 "words": My 2007 Toyota RAV4 6 cyl continues to amaze me | This my third Japanese vehicle and will probably exceed my expectations in terms of reliability | Toyotas do not break no expensive repair bills no frustration | The 2007 RAV4 is destined to be a favorite for decades to come | 
 "words": The one vehicle to have for practicality | Lots of interior room fairly economical and more refinement than CRV | Performance of the Toyota four puts my old Chrysler six to shame | 
 "words": This my 4th Rav4 | I've owned '98 '01 '06 and this '07 | This model has incredible power which is why I traded back my '06 V6 | The roominess is a great improvement to old models as is quality of interior exterior | The gas mileage is nowhere near advertised | The cup holders should have been kept the same as '01-'05 versions I'm tired of spilt coffee and looking for places to put drinks on long drives | Overall I just love this vehicle | 
 "words": Just had 5000 mile service | I heard a humming noise at 40 mph turns out it was in xmssn | Dealer replaced whole xmssn | Fun to drive but ride is really bumpy | I average 21-23 mpg driving mostly fwy | Great stereo system and bluetooth love controls on steering wheel love heated seats love being higher up | Almost bought the Honda CRV but couldn't get comfortable | RAV is easier to get in and out of and RAV has 8-way adjustable seats which are great | Wish it had satellite radio standard like the CRV | Plenty of room for me up front CRV was very cramped | I love the secret cargo area in back and also the cargo net | It carries groceries very well | Overall I really like this car | 
 "words": I researched the 2007 RAV4 the Honda CR-V and the Mazda CX7 before selecting the RAV4 | The ride is very comfortable | Steering is precise and effortless although being FWD there's always a slight tendency for oversteer | Still it's far less than the 2002 Mazda Tribute it replaced | Wind road noise is nicely muted even with the sunroof in tilt-up mode | Fully open and with no deflector it's still not so loud as to bother me | The controls and gauges are easy to reach and see | The daytime running lights | a 40 option | are a joy | Fit and finish are generally very good to excellent | nothing feels cheap | I got a Champagne colored vehicle with the ersatz wood grain trim | it looks great | 
 "words": Have only had 1 week after trading in my 2003 Rav4 | What a change | Love the V6 from the old sewing machine 2 Litre | Nice layout from the dash to seats | Bravo Toyota | Even the base stereo deserves a 10 compared to the 2003 | Love the moonroof with hopes of a suntan on the ole cueball | 
 "words": Purchased in August '06 and have driven it about 5000 miles | Although the engine is powerful there is a bit of steering instability when accelerating hard | Also the suspension is a bit 'bouncy' | I also drive a Mini Cooper with very stiff suspension and I guess I prefer the stiffer ride to the RAV4's | I agree that the standard stereo is disappointing as are the cupholders | We get pretty good mileage average 23mpg but we tend to drive conservatively | It is tempting to step into the gas pedal now and then but I am sure that this results in significantly less mileage as others have reported | Also when you do step into it the downshift is rather abrupt and startling | 
 "words": If you're considering the RAV4 for it's great milage consider this | I travel 60 hwy miles and another 20 on rural roads daily | My ave hwy speed is 72 and I'm no leadfoot around town either | With this mix I should be getting 25MPG consistently | After 4000 miles traveling the same daily route my RAV4 averages 21 | 5MPG | One tank gets 19 the next 23 and the next 21 | 5 | Dealer says there's nothing wrong | So if you're considering sacreficing the roominess and comfort of a larger SUV to get better milage with a RAV think twice | 
 "words": I bought my RAV4 in December and the whether got bad the minute I left the lot literally the first snowflakes fee as I pulled onto the road | The car drove like a dream on both wet and snow covered roads | The heated seats and self-dimming mirror are great | As the motor gets broken in my milage is moving up | I love this car | 
 "words": Bought my car 2 weeks ago and I couldn't be more happy | It is fun to drive has great visability smooth smooth brakes unbelievable pickup with the V-6 and great looks too | I also test drove the Honda CR-V and while it has nice looks this year it doesn't offer a V-6 or bluetooth which I have found to be a must buy if you can afford them | I look forward to many fun years of driving this great car | 
 "words": Good power in 4CYL good fuel economy for SUV great style | I've had this SUV for a month and it is awesome | It drives like a car | It has the interior space of an SUV but is still small overall | I've received tons of compliments on it | I have driven my 4WD on ice and it performs remarkably | 
 "words": I had an Audi A3 AWD V6 which was too small for what I wanted so I traded it in for a RAV4 V6 4WD | Although these two vehicles are in different classes the RAV4 is just as quick and fast as the A3 but offers more room for cargo and passengers | You can't beat the room that the RAV offers and you certainly can't beat the price | Although I do miss the heated seats on the A3 I don't miss anything else | 
 "words": The V6 mpg EPA rating is way overstated beware | I use 91 octane and still get about 22mpg on the highway 65mph 17 city if I'm lucky | I drive conservatively | I get about 300 miles per tank about 50 miles less per tank than the 2 year old ford explorer I traded in on sure the Explorer had a bigger tank but still | All told I'd wish I kept the Explorer | I bought the RAV4 based on the 22 28 mileage statement which is just wrong very wrong | I feel cheated | I've appealed to Toyota several times with incident reports without even the courtesy of a reply | Wish I could return it also as it's a gas hog for a new generation vehicle | 
 "words": I have bought this car more than a year ago | It feels so alive and sporty | Fuel Economy is great | If you drive on highway It will make 29 mpg and it looks great | Every one loves it | If you go faster than 80 mph you will hear the wind noise but over all I love it | It handels like a dream | It does not feel like a suv | just test drive it | 
 "words": I am in sales and pretty much live in my vehicle | Because I'm in the construction industry and do some off- road driving to get to job sites I decided to get the Rav4 Sport for the 4WD | I love the roominess and the layout | It is very comfortable and fun to drive | I also get excellent gas mileage | I am extremely pleased with it | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle | I down sized from a Dodge Durango and other than a few of the comforts heated seats leather I don't miss it for a second | The RAV has a smooth ride with guts when needed | I love taking it up to the mountians on ski trips and with all the room there is plenty of room for friends |

 "words": This review written after 10000 miles and almost 1 year ownership We have a 17-year old so the goal was to find a small SUV which offered all modern safety features in a reliable package | Naturally Toyota Honda were the top 2 choices and Honda had not yet come out with the new CRV in Feb 2006 | We chose the 4-cylinder to avoid overpowering the car and are happy with it | Also avoided the optional 3rd seat to limit temptation to carry too many passengers | Visibility is good for the driver the mileage is genuinely 26 mpg on highway at 65 and overall a year later still seems like best choice at time but now that Honda has released new CRV I would recommend testing that as well | 
 "words": I was heavily influenced by the favorate reviews | After purchasing I was dispointed for two major reasons | The car looks fine when stands alone but appears so tiny when parked next to most other vehicles | Gas mileage is more like 20 rather than 28 even with 95 high way driving | That was one major reason I bought this vehicle | I would go exchange for something else if there were such a thing as exchanging a new car like what you do in a supermarket |

 "words": The four-cylinder engine which I tested in a RAV4 Sport is pretty peppy but the V6 boasts about a hundred extra horses for an eat-my-dust total of 269 | That six-cylinder is a sinful delight as it turn the RAV4 into a veritable pocket rocket by pushing it from zero to 60 in under seven seconds | Driving the RAV4 is a pleasure | The view is excellent | Steering is precise and responsive and the brake seems to read your mind | Cabin noise even at 75-plus mph is well under control | All the gauges and knobs are pretty much where you | d expect to find them | The cargo space is impressive | bigger than that of a Jeep Grand Cherokee | 
 "words": Recently purchased but | so far so good | I have never been happier with purchasing a new vehicle | The Rav4 is great on gas for an SUV I have the 4cyl but it still has good get-up-and- go on the interstate | I couldn't be happier with my new Toyota |

 "words": I love my new RAV4 | It is a kick to drive has lots of room for my groceries chicken feed and dogs | My only complaint is the gas mileage | I am not getting anywhere close to 27 mpg and if anyone should it's me | I live in a very rural area and do not do any stop and go driving | For a matter of fact every tank so far has gotten worse | I started at almost 27 mpg and when I filled up today only got 22mpg | My first oil change is about 60 days away so I am hoping that the dealer can make some adjustments that will help | 
 "words": Bought the 4 cylinder version in January 2006 | No complaints on motor | Interior is very spacious for this class | Two weaknesses stand out 1 the interior rattles from more than one location and I can't locate or stop all the rattles | Not good for a Toyota frankly | 2 Less importantly the center-console cupholders are very poorly designed | Prepare for spilled drinks because the pressure-tabs are useless for holding anything less than jumbo cups | Overall the vehicle is well worth the price | I like the 4 cylinder version with no 3rd seat for teenage drivers for safety considerations and the rear-door spare too |

 "words": With two kids we love the optional third-row of seats | It allows us to take an extra kid or two to hockey practice soccer | etc | There is a surprising amount of room left for storage with the third seat up | Though I wouldn't reccomend that row for anyone but children because it leaves no leg room | With the seat down there is a lot of storage in the back | Again we are hockey parents so that is a huge plus | The milage has been great about 27 mpg mostly highway driving | And I love the audio jack for the MP3 player | The stability control is great and it has downhill assist which should come in handy in the snow this winter |

 "words": It's a rare and wonderful thing to find a small SUV being over-engined but this thing fits the bill | And to pay almost no penalty at the gas pump is icing on the cake | It has a few quirks but every dip into that lovely V6 and 5 speed automatic manages to temporarily erase them | The most annoying thing so far was the typical current Toyota trend of having no choice of options ALL V6 Sport AWD models in our 4 state area come optioned exactly the same way | Period | Other than that the car has excellent chassis dynamics a truly superior drivetrain good highway stability and it's fairly quiet to boot | Almost perfect for it's intended market | Front seat travel sacrificed for rear room |
