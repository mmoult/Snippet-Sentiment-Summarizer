 "words": You hear all the hype about GMC being Professional Grade don't believe it | I purchased an '07 Envoy with a Nav System | This Nav system is a waste of money | It is DVD based like most but the one thing that GMC did that all other makersdecided not to do was to only allow the in-dash unit to accept one disc at a time | For a 2000 option don't waste your money if you want to Nav and listen to your CDs | Get the 6-disc in- dash and buy a TomTom or Garvin that rides on the dash | It is cheaper and better that way | 
 "words": I think this SUV for the money is very well built | If you look at other American SUV's costing way more I think the SLT 4x4 Envoys are about the best out |
