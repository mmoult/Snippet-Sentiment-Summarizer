REVIEWS
 "words": Supremely comfortable as far as its seats go 2 | 4 provides adequate power feels very safe understated looks | Its quirks can be very annoying however | Chief among them are counterintuitive and slow-acting power door locks needlessly complicated radio and climate controls inadequate sun visors unlit power-seat memory buttons | Not especially quiet in terms of engine noise | Fit and finish adequate but perhaps less than I expected | The dash trim is apparently real wood but finished to look cheaper than the plastic on my old Subaru | And might I add that tire-pressure sensors are a nightmare | 
 "words": This has been a fantastic car | Very comfortable for the long haul with outstanding seats lots of cargo room and best of all it flies | No one expects that a Volvo wagon can move so quickly | I often have cars trying to pass me on the right cut me off etc | I can easily close down any hole in the traffic with this car | Passing merging is fun | Blitzing down interstate on-ramps is a joy | Clover leaf on-ramps are a treat as well | The upgraded sound system is worth the money | If you want a lot of go with very little show this is your car | 
 "words": Great on the open road and mileage has been great city 25 highway 31 MPG | Handles better than my prior bmw even though it is a station wagon | Great for long trips and needing extra space | Too bad the 2008's are being redesigned and don't hold up against the 2007 V70
 "words": I have been wanting to purchase a V70 or XC70 for a few years | I swapped my Toyota 4Runner due to gas mileage for the V70 | The Volvo drives and sounds a lot like my Honda Accord that I had 12 years ago | I love that Honda and I love the way this car drives | I will be using the car for surfing so I opted for the optional roof racks which do produce some wind noise | The biggest suprise is the performance | I have owned 3 porsches and I currently own a 911 | I must say the Volvo's pick up is excellent and I can really feel the turbo's kick | I am very pleased with the car so far and I hope to keep it for at least 8-10 years | 
 "words": I bought a 2007 V70 closeout which came with lots of options as a replacement for my wife's 940 which was totaled in a wreck great deal | The car is very comfortable driving and handling | The 2 | 5T has excellent pickup compared with the older B230F engine | Gas mileage is good approx 22 mpg around town | 
 "words": Great design for short people | offers plenty of visibility | Bought a luxury package that makes the car very attractive | Wish gas mileage were better though but at least it accepts regular gas without harming anything | 
 "words": V2 | 4L provides enough power for daily use | Ride is quiet and steering provides excellent handling | Excellent suspension | Good combination of engine and automatic transmission | Integrated child booster seat may not be comfortable for long distances since legs touch the edge of the seat | Leather interior will require a protective sheet for the baby seat | 
 "words": Provides more usable space than most small SUVs while possessing better road manners and comfort | However after having driven Saabs for many years I found the large turning radius of this vehicle to be almost truck-like by comparison | 
 "words": Great gas mileage and a great road trip vehicle for your rides to Grandma's house | The 2 | 4 L engine does not miss a step | It has more than enough pep to handle everyday driving | 
 "words": I bought a similar version in 2001 and drove my Volvo for over 185000 with no issues other than routine maintenance | The engineering is fantastic fuel economy is good considering size and weight of the vehicle | Safety is fantastic and overall best car I have ever bought | 
 "words": What a nice car | Bought it for safety reputation | Handles well is comfortable and holds road like it's glued | Too much wind noise and low beams cut off too short | Fit and finish is first rate and car is tight excpept for wind noise | Gets less fuel economy than other mid-sized domestic cars which was a surprise | Get 21-23 in town and 26-29 in hilly country so I guess that's not too bad | Guess I'm getting old but it has one tough oil filter for a shade tree mechanic | Plenty speedy with 2 | 5 turbo | The run flat tires had defective sensors that dealer service did not understand and were impossible to fix | Eventually replaced | I like the car alot |
