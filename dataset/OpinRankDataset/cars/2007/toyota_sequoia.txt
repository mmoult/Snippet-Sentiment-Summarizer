REVIEWS
 "words": I just had a BMW x5 and I just hated not having a third row seat and had 3 kids and had a lot of play dates | When my lease was up I could not wait to get a new car | I was looking at the Highlander and didn't like it as much as the Sequoia | I got just a couple of weeks ago and now I love to get out of the house | I love the second row captain chairs and removable center console | I think I should never get a new car again because I bought mine | 
 "words": The Sequoia is an excellent SUV | Reliability has been great | At 25000 miles repair of the tension control for the fan belt was required up to 38500 now and no other repairs | Like the looks of the 2007 better than the new style | Would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV that is big and holds a lot of stuff | Even got a full queen size headboard in the back | 
 "words": I've had my Sequoia for a little over two years now and though I love driving the vehicle and it works well for my family of five I am 15000 miles past my manufacturer's warranty and already have over 2000 | 00 in repairs | I was lucky enough to have purchased the extended warranty so I haven't had to pay for these repairs out of pocket but I am very worried about what this vehicle is going to cost me in the long run | I am pretty sure I will dump it when it is paid for | This is a shame because I really like the vehicle from a users point of view | My last issue was with the fuel pump at 45000 miles | The part alone is over 600 | 00 from the dealership | That excludes labor | 
 "words": This is the most practical and stylish vehicle I have owned | I refuse to drive a mini van | this was well worth the increased price | I can comfortably haul five kids for hours having them watch the big screen DVD in comfort | It is easy to drive and not expensive to maintain | 
 "words": I've only had this vehicle for 2000 miles but so far I am pleased | It rides a little tougher than I'd hoped on a smooth road it's great but where are those but it doesn't jar your teeth loose and it's taut and quiet | The 08 fixed all my gripes about this model except the price I couldn't justify another 25K for fold down seats and that wonderful 5 | 7L in the 08 | Drive 65 for 500 mi you'll be surprised pleasantly | Having a trained ear the JBL is simply not worth the money to me but for RR I'm sure it's just fine | 
 "words": I am very disappointed in the engineering design ergometrics of my 2007 Sequoia Limited | The console controls are not lighted side mirrors seat heater and in a poor location because the seat heaters can be turned on by laying an item across the console | No dash indicator light for fog lights | The gas mileage is poor 16 mpg highway and 14 around town | Rear storage compartment won't stay latched | Second seats will stay folded up must restrain with a tether | I have factory nav system and satellite radio not available | Limited slip differential doesn't lock engaging TRAC OFF seems to help but that doesn't make sense | I wish I had my Chevy Tahoe back | 
 "words": I bought a Toyota for their supposed great customer satisfaction and reliability | I must say that this not what I have experienced | The car does start and run just fine | The problem lies in all the little things going wrong and the number of times that dealer visits are required | So far both mirrors have gone loose | The clock has failed the rear hatch won't stay open the power outlets have failed | the list goes on | On top of that the dealer and Toyota Corporate are great at stating that not all problems can be fixed under warranty even though the warranty has not expired | I still have 18 months left on the warranty and 10k miles to go | 
 "words": The 2007 Sequoia is a great vehicle for a family with too much stuff | Ample storage room comfortable seats | No issues over the first 10K miles | Great build quality fairly quiet interior | Tires seem to wear well | Have avgd around 20 miles gallon on hwy | Around 15 city | Overall great looks fun to drive | Much better value compared to the 2008s | Would buy again | 
 "words": After owning a 4Runner for the past 6 years we needed a bit more room we travel with show dogs to dog shows and needed the space for crates we upgraded to the Sequoia | I wanted the '07 version since I like the body style better than the '08s | I love the vehicle but it does ride louder and a bit rougher than my '07 4Runner | This vehicle is WAY too big not to have a backup camera so we are having that added immediately | I also like the a c and heater controls more than in my 4Runner | LOVE the universal remote to open my garage and don't know how I ever lived without the heated seats | I really overall love this car and expect to still be driving it in 10 years | 
 "words": As a confirmed Toyota hater I was surprised at how much I liked this vehicle | Not sure how long I will keep it | I wanted a diesel Mercedes | I did not like the MB 7 speed transmission | This is MUCH smoother and less intrusive | 
 "words": I have had this vehicle for 6 mos now and just love it | Comfortable and great tow vehicle for our midsize boat | Better gas mileage than most other large SUVs | Engine is both smooth and full of torque | I have the pkg that has the rear captain chairs and would recommend this seating unless you have 5 kids | 
 "words": I had my mind set on the new GL320 CDI Mercedes | I test drove it and did not like the 7 speed transmission | On a fluke I drove the Sequoia | I really do not like Toyota | I do like this SUV | It is not a diesel that I wanted but it is a very nice ride | On a trip to AZ I was not at all tired after 5 straight hours behind the wheel | I would recommend it | 
 "words": Love this car | What a great car for our long road trips and also all the in town day to day driving too | Nav and the DVD are great and a must have | The third seat comes in handy for extra family in town and can fold up or be taken out easily | The 2nd row bucket seats that recline with very large console is very nice and our teenager loves it | We will have this car for many years to come | We get 14 | 3 mpg in town | 
 "words": This vehicle is really fabulous | I have been a life long owner of Acura Honda vehicles and now am extremely happy with my new purchase of a 2007 Toyota Sequoia Ltd | in June 2007 | I've had many knee operations and this vehicle provides me with ample leg room while all of my previous vehicles did not | Everything about this Sequoia is really perfect | And regarding the fuel mileage I average 15 | 4 miles per gallon and that is almost as good as I was getting with the Acura MDX | If you are in need of a safe heavy roomy and reliable SUV this is your one | My daughter convinced me to buy the Sequoia and it was a great move | 
 "words": We purchased this SUV after owning a Durango for 8 years and what a difference | Smooth ride lots of room especially with two kids | We bought the luxury package and love the second row captains chairs and the center console | The kids can keep all of their things videos head phones games etc | all in one place | I splurged and got a wood-wrapped steering wheel which makes the car feel like a luxury vehicle | And I second the vote on Artic Frost Pearl best color ever | It is very pretty | 
 "words": We were in the market this year for a larger SUV expecting our second child and looked at everything on the market to be fair | It came down to the Expedition and the Sequoia | The Sequoia is by far the best full size SUV you can get for the money | We were also able to get ours at an exceptional value considering Toyota is cleaning the lots this time of year | Perfect for a two baby child family | Decent on gas and the ride is as smooth as most cars | We couldn't be happier and are officially a Toyota family | We bought a black SR5 with appearance package tan interior sunroof towing package | It is a sharp SUV and we are looking forward to taking it on our first road trip soon | 
 "words": I've always been a skeptic about the performance of our Toyota Sequoia but after a recent car accident I can't imagine a safer car | My sister recently endured a traumatic car crash with our Sequoia flying 10 feet in the air and flipping three times and she came out shaken but nearly unscathed | The Toyota Sequoia is built like a tank and guarantees both the satisfaction of a SUV and a safe vehicle | It's quite literally a life saver | 
 "words": The Sequoia is one of the best SUVs we have owned or test driven | It's a great vehicle and one of the smoothest rides | It's also a great looking car | The color of our Sequoia is Arctic Frost and it is one of the most beautiful colors ever | It's a creamy white with an irridescent pearl flakes in it | We had the headrest DVDs put in for our boys and they can both either watch the same or different movie or connect their gamecube | It's great for long trips | I will definitely keep the Sequoia in our family | We have gone from being Ford drivers to Toyota | Our next Toyota will be a Tundra for my husband | 
 "words": This car has everything a little rough on off road but would not change a thing | 
 "words": Have had this SUV since 2001 when they first came out | Have 116000 miles on her | Hope for another 116000 | Great styling | Now I see so many of them on the road | Can't wait to see the new styling | 
 "words": I decided to test drive a Sequoia | I took it home an hour later | This is an extremely quiet and smooth ride | Solid workmanship makes this the ultimate in style comfort and an all around SUV that remains timeless | Well done Toyota I'll be back for another one if this ever goes out | I currently have 93k on it runs like a brand new Sequoia |
