 "words": I bought my '07 Aveo in October 4649 Miles and tagged at 11000 | The vehicle does really good in city driving but leaves something to be desired at highway speeds | I own the manual transmission and had to upgrade with an aftermarket intake just to feel like I was moving faster then a stagecoach | All in all the car is fairly stable once you reach your goal speed as long as it isn't windy but takes a long time to accelerate even when you lean on the higher RPM's | And it would be a good car for the price if you don't care about looks or horse's thanks to the the MPG and dependability factor | But that's all it has going for it to be honest | My opinion is buy another vehicle like the Cobalt | 
 "words": I am a social worker for the Commonwealth of KY and cover 13 counties of my region | I have driven my Aveo over 45000 miles in less than a year over mountainous roads gravel two-lane black top and four lane highways | My Aveo has done excellent | I paid less than 14000 for a fully loaded red beauty with sliding sky roof air auto alarm | It has been flawless | I even hit a 100lb deer at 60 MPH and only damaged the hood grille | It took the licking and I never had to park it but drove it every day since | 
 "words": I bought this based on Chevy's reputation | At 4000 miles the generator and fuse box fried | At 30000 the AC went and the dealer seems unable to locate another one | When they find one they are going to have to special order seals | The front end will not stay aligned and the car is too noisy especially in a wind | The standard transmission feels like it is grinding | The car is roomy and fun to drive but it is not well built | My suggestion is to look at other sub-compacts | 
 "words": There is plenty of room in the front although the seats could be more comfortable for longer legged people | The styling is similar to many others on the road now and can be made to look pretty sporty | The worst drawback is the mileage | I drive 40 mises a day35 of it no the freeway and it averages 31 MPG | Not too good for a 1 | 6 liter four cylinder with almost no horsepower | I bought it thinking it would be alot like the Geo Metro only bigger | The Metro was quickerand got half again more mileage Boy do I miss it | 
 "words": I bought this car mainly for the fuel economy 1 | 6L 4cyl 5A 25-30 | We were so happy until 15000 miles and bang major repair in shop for a week now waiting for parts in drive train control arm | This is a major disappointment | The car is light in the high winds | Should have bought the Toyota Corolla for 2k more | 
 "words": This was my first new car and I have not been disappointed | It is practical in terms of price but very nicely designed as well | It is a small vehicle which is perfect for fitting into small parking spaces but inside it doesn't feel cramped | Additionally Chevrolet offers a great warranty which I haven't had to use yet but it good to know it is available if needed | 
 "words": I have come to love driving it but it lacks acceleration and the miles per gallon are not that great | I estimate that I get maybe 15mpg as oppose to the 26 to 32 that I have seen posted on the sticker | The head room is great as for the leg room which can become an issue with passengers in the back | I like the handling around corners and how smooth the ride is | All in all I've grown to love the cars qualities as well as its downsides
 "words": We just got our Aveo in December | I used it for a business conferance to Lake Geroge 350 miles across southern NY | I set the cruise at 70 for most of the trip | I'm a big fellow 270 and I felt the car was pretty peppy | Lots of head room and body room | And considering I averaged 34 mpg I think the car's a good deal | The dealer sold the car to us for just under 12000 including rebates | All we added was cruise control | We only have three thousand miles on it but so far it runs like a champ | By the by | I had good winter tires installed at purchased along with extra rims | The car handles very well in heavy snow and on ice with those tires | 
 "words": Very nice car for the money | I was totally surprised at the interior design fit and finish layout and features loaded into my 07 Aveo LT | I switched out a few things and customized the car like two tone black and tan leather seats | The factory only offers tan leather a little too much | Gets good gas mileage has plenty of space and really no complaints | I even went back to the dealer just to price some parts to see the cost and the parts are inexpensive | 
 "words": Best deal on basic transportation hands down | Drove out of the dealership with a brand new Aveo for 7250 | Granted this included a 2K GM Card rebate but without it I would have gotten it for 8250 a price including TTL | Performance is adequate lots of room and no power locks windows that will break in a few years anyways | Great GM warranty | Build quality is very good | Engine is a bit weak | you'll need to downshift to make it up a steep hill | Gas mileage is good not stellar | Appreciate the side-impact airbags | For the price it's unbeatable | Lots of 2007's still on dealer lots if you look | 
 "words": Wanted a solid commuter with modern options and liked the look of the newly redesigned Aveo | No doubt this is a small car but it does feel pretty spacious on the inside | I got the LT with leatherette interior and it is definitely a cut above your average domestic | The car feels solid and is easy to drive | my only real concern is high winds on the interstate | Car feels like it might simply get carried up up and away | Also long-term quality is a possible issue but I guess I'll just have to see on that one | 
 "words": I traded a 2005 Cobalt for this car | In spite of the smaller size it is more comfortable but it doesn't have the driver information center like the cobalt | I had got used to being able to teel the fuel economey and the outside temperature | It also has a ridiculous power lock system that can only be locked with a key when one is leaving the car | The power is adequate and it is quite roomy | 
 "words": I bought this car mainly for the fuel economy | This is the only area it reached my expectations | I have had it into the dealer 4 times for problems | One of them involved replacing the main seal which took a week | This is a defect in the vehicle other Aveo's have the same problem | The car didn't even have 8000 miles on it | Then within a week I had to have a sensor replaced | In the past I have always been pleased with GM vehicles but this one is a major disappointment | I don't feel safe driving it long distances and I am glad there is a dealer near my home and another near my work | I will be getting rid of this car ASAP | 
 "words": I really like driving the car so it is a fun car with 6k into it | However in severe crosswinds unacceptable howling noise across cowl | fuel economy isn't what expected at 25 mpg | windshield wipers weren't tighten and flopped all over | I want GM to have a contender in this class of vehicle | 12500 isn't cheap | Fix these things and GM will have one on both price and realiablity 
 "words": I have a new apreation for econo cars after buying this exceptional example of Chevrolet's restyled import | Well worth the price | While true i had more than my share of problems from the start | First a cracked windshild three days after I drove it off the lot replaced then a headlamp fogged up from holding moisturereplaced lose brake caliperrepairedrear view mirror mount fell offreplaced oil pump started leaking after 15K replacedsqueeking swaybar bushings after 25Kreplaced clunking front suspensionstill an isue | After all this you might think i would be bitter but I just love driving this car | I like the looks i like the handling and I love the MPG at 32 39 | 
 "words": I came into the Aveo because my full sized truck was guzzling too much gas | I wanted an inexpensive commuter | I ended up with a pretty upscale for an Aveo 4 dr LT and it's much more car than I expected | It's smooth on the highway and comfortable and has many features you wouldn't normally expect to find in this price range like side airbags | The sound system is nice with the MP3 changer and the steering wheel controls are good too | I went to the dealership just looking but the price was too good to pass up after I saw how much car I could get for the money | 
 "words": Got tired of commuting in my SUV getting 20mpg in summer and 18 in winter | Bought the Aveo on Edmund's study of lowest vehicle cost per mile | We get 31 to 34 in the city commuting and took one trip of 300 miles one way | 31 into the wind of 20 mph and 38 coming with the wind | Has plenty of power for most needs | Haven't found anything to complain about | Does what it was made to do | Economy car shoppers beware of the foreign car hype of high gas mileage we rented several of them before buying and found them to be lacking in mpg from what the manufacturer advertised | This is made by Daewoo plant to Chevy specs but at least our money stays in the USA | Good job GM | 
 "words":  I run a service center for a dealer and I am very familiar with cars | I bought American because I am always able to get 250k out of all my cars | It wasnt until recently that I needed to put my GMC truck to bed and get an import | I looked at Toyota Nissan great cars Mazda Honda etc | I finally picked the 2007 Chevy Aveo because of price comfort and gas mileage | However I am not getting anywhere near 37mpg as my sticker suggested | Believe me I understand driving habbits but this has nothing to do with it | I drive all freeway miles with no A C on at no more than 70mph and the best milage I get is 30 | 1mpg | Yes I also tryed going under 70mph and I only got max 32 | 1 mpg | 
 "words": I have owned my little Aveo for almost 8 months | I have over 28K on the car right now no problems excellent gas mil avg 35mpg | It's the little things that make this car really worth buying | It's the lumbar support the rubber on the knobs on the interior the power everything the antenna integrated into the rear window the easy to work on engine compartment the well placed cruise control buttons the mp3 jack the six disc changer spacious truck for such a little car the head room in the interior | This car was made to be the perfect commuter vehicle | It is just one of the best buys you can make add all the stuff and throw in the rabate and 0 that I got on it and its a steal | 
 "words": I am very pleased | Gas mileage is 36 on hwy but 26 in the cityStop and go The car is very comfortable for me even though I am a larger male | 
 "words": I have owned Aveo 5 now for 2 weeks | I chose this vehicle over the honda fit because of price difference about 3000 Versa because no fold flat or flip and fold seats Yaris because I needed a 4 door hatch and PT because of fuel economy | I also chose the Aveo because by far it had the best styling of all of them | The seat covers are durable and attractive and I loved the carbon fiber look trim | On to the driving it is a much better driving experience than would be expected from a budget sub compact | It is quiet zippy for such a low horsepowerand overall handles as well if not better than some of the pricier cars I have owned | Plenty of cargo room with flip and fold seats too | Love it | 
 "words": This is really a fine little car | I am a professional but got tired of sending my gas money to foreign lands | The Aveo gets good mileage 27 in city 37 on highway | Not great but good | Considering the price of the car great mieage | The result is a very affordable car that gets good mileage has some style and is fun to drive | I am amazed that is has not given me any trouble at all | I drive it a lot | We took it on a 1600 mile drive recently and it is more comfortable than a larger sedan | My main complaint is the small sun visor and weak cup holders | I would buy another great car | 
 "words": If you are looking for a low cost alternative to a used vehicle the Aveo is a great choice | Gas mileage has ranged from 32 | 4 to 36 | 6 mpg | I had been shopping for a new commuter for about 9 months and had seen the special value Aveo advertised by two local dealers for less than 8000 a couple of times | Finally decided that the next time I saw them offered in this price range I would buy | I ended up paying 7660 | The Aveo should serve very well as an economical run about | Its not the Prius that I really wanted but was 1 4 the cost and still gets very respectable mpg | 
 "words": It's a great car for the money | After all you wouldn't buy a car like this unless low cost was important to you | It's very stylish inside and out and seems well made so far 1200 miles | Engine is fuel efficient but I am surprised it isn't more so | Chevrolet and the Korean manufactures of the Aveo could make some simple improvements to make it a great car | variable speed intermittent wipers actual electronic door lock buttons more storage better cup holder location in the front seat etc | Overall it is a good car for those on a tight budget | 
 "words": Fantastic car | consistantly get 32 in the city w AC on and well over 40 MPG on the highway | Drive the car reasonably as it's meant to be it's not a sports or performance car so it shouldn't be driven as such keep the cruise on the highway at 70-75 MPG and you'll be suprised | Yes the Aveo can go 90 MPH if it needs to | No problems at all with car at 13500 Many compliments on LT Sedan | Well worth the money | No complaints at all except the cup holders | 
 "words": It's my wife's first new car and turns out I use it more than her | I just love it | We just came back from a 1500 mile trip and it performed perfectly | 
 "words": Being a full-time student with very little funds I was very limited on which car I could buy | I didn't necessarily want the Aveo at first especially after finding out that it was Korean made and had some bad reviews | However I have to say that I absolutely enjoy this car | I love how I don't have to be right on top of the steering wheel I'm 5 foot even The interior is cheapy but really | I needed a car to get from A to B with the best gas possible for the less price | I found it | I couldn't be happier with my choice | 
 "words": I was very impressed with the ride comfort an handling of this car | It is a vast improvement over subcompacts of previous generations | I really like the european stlying direction GM has been taking with the vehicles it has brought to market over the last few years | It is a little strained to accelerate up a hill starting from a standstill but what the hell | it's no worse than our Jeep Liberty | The shift quality could be a little better but here again I didnt purchase a Porsche | To sum up in terms of interior and exterior styling fuel economy ride comfort and handling it is a very good value for the money | I made my purchase chioce over Honda Fit Toyota Yaris | 
 "words": The interior is solid performance is good | However the steering wheel and drivers seat vibrate excessively when idling the gas mileage is under 20mpg when using the a c the struts squeak when going over bumps and the ride is very stiff you feel every bump |

 "words": I must say that even though I purchased this car for my wife I really want it for myself | I drive it any chance I get | It is actually quite sporty in both the design and handling | Very little came with the car in terms of features but it is worth it | I have pretty decent credit and although I may not have gotten the best rate out there I still feel like my payment is nothing | Most importantly it is a safe car with side airbags standard and has a great crash rating hope we never have proof of that | 
 "words": I have owned this car for a few months and I do like it but the gas mileage is not what I was told or expected | I love the appearance and the look to the car especially for what I spent | I have a few concerns | 
 "words": The low cost of ownership in this hatchback is what initiallly attracted us | The main thing that finally sold us was that both my wife 5'3 125 lb and I 6'2 220 lb could find reasonably comfortable driving positions | Many other small cars do a poor job of accomodating those of us who aren't about the standard 5'8 | It is surprisingly roomy inside there is actually enough headroom to for me to sit up in the backseat | The Aveo's performance and mileage while adequate could be better but you can't have everything at this price point | 
 "words": I just love this little car | It is so fun to drive | The gas mileage is a little less then I thought it would be but I get about 30 in overall driving | It has lots of leg and head room | It feels as if you are sitting in a real chair and has good interior styling-flashy dashboard and stereo knobs etc | It has a lot of little extras | 
 "words": Very light weight handles very poorly in wind | Gets a nasty screeching noise from doors or mirrors when driving in wind | Front engine crankshaft seal failed yesterday lost all oil damaged engine oil idiot light did not come on before engine started knocking | GM will only replace damaged parts which is the crankshaft and bearings | Not pleased with that should get a fresh engine and waranty | Manual transmission is already showing signs of problems clunks into gear and sometimes hard to get into first | I am not a kid hot roding it | Its a commuter car I drive it carefully | 
 "words": Had no intention of purchasing a new vehicle but the warranty and price pushed me over the edge | After spending thousands on used vehicles over the past 3 years I wised up and purchased this little hatchback | I am 6'2 and a little over 250 pounds and I have no trouble getting in or out of the car | I am amazed at the amount of room | My only suggestion would be change the cup holders but for the price how can I complain | The car has great fit and finish and the room inside is amazing | I even get people telling me how much they like my car when I am in town | 
 "words": Having owned and driven this car for 2 months I am impressed with its comfort and driveability in city traffic | We have studded tires where I live and the rough pavement on local freeways is a bit harsh to drive on but all other characteristics are fine | This is my 18th vehicle over 39 years and it delivers everything I thought it would | I bought this car as an inexpensive alternative to a used vehicle for good mileage in city work commutes and it fills the bill perfectly | 
 "words": I love my Aveo | It is a fun sporty car | It has a lot of little extras | I've gotten some people asking me if it is a Volkswagen | If you compare a Jetta with it you'll find that the body is similar | It has lots of leg and head room | It feels as if you are sitting in a real chair and has good interior styling-flashy dashboard and stereo knobs etc | The engine is spaced out enough that a do-it-yourself mechanic can work on it comfortably | It's an American car which hopefully means cheaper parts though I have heard that American cars tend to break down more so we'll see in the long run what's least expensive | With chrome lined lights a spoiler and a sunroof this is the cutest little car Chevy makes | 
 "words": I was very happy with this buy because its my first car | I needed somthing cheap and good | The look was great and the interior was great for the price range | What won me over was the look and the price and the miles this thing gets | I support American cars so I love this car | Sorry Yaris | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle primarily for fuel economy | I consistently get 36-40 mpg in normal driving | Babying it a bit has returned several 43-45 mpg tankfulls | Running it hard on the freeway 80 mph drops the mileage to the 30-33 range | Comfort is good for a car of this class comparable to my old Honda Civic | I love the lumbar support in the driver's seat | The transmission is geared well to deal with the car's modest engine torque while coming up to speed | and cruises well at highway speeds | I have not encountered any high speed or crosswind instability | Vehicle is built tight and after 3500 miles has proven to be quite reliable | Cornering and braking are better than I expected | 
 "words": I bought this car because it was cheap but I feel like I got a lot of car for the money | I rented a 2006 Malibu over the summer and I think this is comparable in styling and driving except for being only 4cyl | It's sharp and comfortable | Great visibility and you feel like you're sitting high up | Love that it has an interior trunk and gas release | Good car for the money | I hope I find it reliable for years to come |

 "words": Very fun to drive although not a cold weather car by any means | If you live somewhere that it is below freezing a lot do not buy this car | The defrost outside of the main vents isn't very good and it will drive you crazy | I've no complaints on this car yet | make sure you get auto door locks as it's optional | I do not have them and wish I'd gone for it | Get all options on this car as there are not many and it still will not cost you that much | 
 "words": I would have to say without a doubt that the improvments in styling for the 2007 model sold us but I especially liked the new rear tailight design | It is much bigger inside than it looks although rear space is limited but feels like a much more expensive car than it is | The ride is good for a small car and handling is also good and makes for easy parking | 
 "words": I think this is a cute fun reliable car | I am glad I bought it | Nice transportation to and from my job as well as around town | I check out many cars and it was a toss between the Aveo Scion or the PT Cruiser | In the end I decided on the Aveo 5 hatchback | I got bright blue which is a pretty color but not my choice | Others I would have had to wait for and I needed transportation in a hurry | I would have preferred the new cinnamon pretty yellow or slate blue | All and all I am satisfied with my new little car and it fits in my driveway behind my husband's larger van | I needed a compact car for that reason | I have one suggestion regarding the side view mirrow |
