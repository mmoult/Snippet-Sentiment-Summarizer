 "words": Update six month in | No mechanical issues to date love it more now than when I purchased | I recently rode in a Lincoln Town Car the Lincoln was not as quite not as smooth and was not as nice as the Kia | If you are looking for a Lexus or Cadillac at firesale prices this is the one | 
 "words": I bought my Amanti primarily for my wife in January 2008 | The Amanti I bought was slightly used with 10300 miles at the time of purchase | We traded in my wife's 2001 Buick Century | Although she loved her Century it could not compare to the 2007 Amanti | The Amanti rides as well as or better than a Buick Lucerne or Park Avenue and goes like a rocket | I have never driven such a luxurious riding car with such power | The car had to be returned to the dealer for two minor defects | but other than that it is rock solid with excellent quality | Anyone that drives a 2007 2008 or 2009 Amanti with the 264 hoursepower engine will LOVE it | 
 "words": It's been a year now since my purchase and I'm still a fan of the Amanti | Love the vehicle and it's reliability | I'm getting low mileage around the city but 80 of my driving is just that | City 15 | 8 MPG | but on the highway I get a strong 34 MPG | I traded my lincoln continental in for this vehicle and was nervous about my choice | I went with the Amanti for value and warranty | I'm glad I did | I've not regretted my decision yet in fact wonder how I got so smart | This car is just flat out fun to drive and has everything in it an on it I ever had with my lincolns | Especially satisfied with winter driving electronic stability control is great | Check out the Amanti befor you buy anything | 
 "words": Purchased used with 22000 miles and loaded with leather sunroof alloys etc | For the used owner car comes with 6 yr 60K full warranty | If you are looking for a BMW this is not your car but if you want a Towncar-like ride on the interstate this is it | Lexus-quality interior massive trunk and back seat extremely fast so quiet you won't hardly know it is running | I am getting 25 MPG with 80 highway 20 city far better than I expected for the size and speed the car offers | The car is a little quirky looking but you don't see many and it sticks out in the crowd | Also front-wheel drive and handles like a tank in the snow | 
 "words": rented one of these for a week on a trip to las vegas based solely on the prompting of the counter clerk they're REALLY nice | she was completely right | fun | powerful | fast | loaded with features | i rented a Cadillac a few days later and this car was REMARKABLY better | if i was ever in this type of car market i'd buy a used one in a heartbeat they have terrible residual value and it's a spectacular car you could get it for a steal | 
 "words": I purchased my Amanti because I wanted a comfortable car with all the options without a high price tag | I have owned Mercedes Lincoln and Cadillac and find this car very satisfying | As others have said it doesn't have the road handling of a Euro car but it amazingly fast and solid feeling | My trip computer consistently records 27 | 5 MPG on the highway at 70 miles per hour | I couldn't believe it myself | This is my second KIA and I will buy a third | 
 "words": Have driven Caddy's Lincoln's Olds and number of other family style autos | The Amanti beats them hands down the car drives and rides very smooth no road or wind noise | Have had zero problems at 38k miles | The car is loaded with every option and performs great | I get compliments all the time the rear end looks like a Lincoln and the front between a Benz and a Jag | Avg 19 | 5 MPG mixed HWY CITY | Would recommend car to anyone who is looking for a solid built smooth riding automobile with ALL the safety feature | 
 "words": Owned a Caddy for 190000 miles and loved it | Went to buy another and saw this bright silver like new KIA Amanti next to it | Carmax salesman said give it a drive best value on the market for a full size sedan | And he was right | Have only owned it a month but already taken a couple of 800 mile trips | Great ride and performance | Great gas mileage and uses regular gas | Have a bad back and the lumbar support and adjustability was fantastic | Sound system blew me away | Wife was skeptical at first but after driving it a couple of times she said hmmm | Trust me that is a big compliment | Can't believe KIA is marketing this car harder
 "words": UPDATE I wrote the previous post 3 25 2008 | Since then I have not regretted this purchase for one moment | In fact I've become a bigger fan of the Amanti | Extremely pleased and I've upgraded my initial impressions because I've had the chance to drive it | Great response cornering | Wonderful highway feel blows my Lincoln away | I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone | At least don't buy anything until you've looked at the Amanti | 
 "words": JUST traded in my 2002 Lincoln Continental for my new loaded Amanti | I have to say I am absolutely amazed that I actually did this | I'm still in shock but was looking for a new car and fell in love with the Amanti | I was nervous about the size difference roominess and comfort but after a day long test drive went back to the dealer and bought it on the spot | Never would have thought I'd own a Kia and that's the best compliment I can give it had to really impress me to buy one | I haven't had it long enough to give a full thorough review but so far so good | Drives great fun power and more comfortable than I would have imagined | Quiet smooth ride that from a Lincoln owner | 
 "words": 20000 miles and one year and I am more pleased than the 1st day | Not a squeak burp or hiccup | The car is perfect | Still a quiet smooth ride with no rattles or problems of any kind | I have done the normal maintenance and that is it | The mileage runs from 19 all city to 22 combo and 24-25 all hwy | The inside looks like the day I purchased it quality is just amazing | Even the valet in the casinos are impressed by this car | Buy one you will like it 
 "words": I have never really heard of this model until about 2 weeks ago | We bought one about three weeks ago | I am so proud I bought this 2007 because it is truly a luxury car not only in appearance and interior comfort and but the outside design looks like a Benz | I have owned well over thirty cars in my lifetime but this has to rate in the top three | BTW I am 62 so I know a lot about cars | This car is a winner | 
 "words": I purchased a pewter beige Amanti with leather package tan interior ESC safety package 17 in | wheels and sunroof | After seeing an article online about the Amanti's redesign for 2007 test driving one was a relevation | I seriously shopped the Amanti vs | the Azera and a couple of other nice sedans and the Amanti won | This car is an amazing value | I am continually being blown away by the quality and features | The quick power and smoothness of the ride are truly a delight | I'd say this car for 2007 is the biggest hidden secret on the U | S | market since Kia is not doing any advertising that I can see | 
 "words": Great car for the price | Comparable in interior room and size luxury sound and performance to the more expensive Chrysler 300M or Buick Lucerne | Taken on 2 trips and was perfect touring car even through West Virginia highways | Wife loves memory seats and power pedal adjustment | 
 "words": I have 6900 miles now and this is an impressive car | It drives great performs terrific and overall is a VERY nice car | The quality is amazing and people always comment and ask about the car even more than my 2006 Chrysler 300 | I took a long trip in this car and was never more pleased with a car | Mine is midnight gray with every option except the cargo mat | The quality of materials and construction is far superior to what you would expect in a Kia and rivals cars at ANY price | The mileage has been slightly better than expected | If you want a true luxury car at a moderate price this is a great choice | 
 "words": I bought a Midnight Gray Amanti with leather package on April 3 | It has an unusual look that grows on me daily | It has an extremely smooth ride and a nice balance | This car isn't the flattest in hard turns but I bought it for the ride quality | I wasn't looking for a sport sedan | I get almost as many stares in the Amanti as my red '70 chevelle | The torque and acceleration are greater than I could have expecteded | Only has 1500 miles so far but I love this car | The beautiful leather fit and finish are awesome | Quietest most comfortable car I've ever ridden in | An impressive car and so affordable | So far the '07 Amanti is a WOW | 
 "words": I went looking for an SUV and thought I'd try the full size Kia | I was almost ready to buy it so I brought my wife to the dealership to look at it | First thing she noticed was the Amanti | Why don't you buy this instead she asked | So we took it for a spin and I loved it | We have owned CaddysVettesHondas VWs you name it | My last car was a Dodge Magnum Hemi | I can't believe I have a Kia but I know that if people tried this car they would buy it | This Amanti has it all | Reg | gas with awesome power and after 2200 miles I've averaged 23 | 9 MPG | 
 "words": This is my second Amanti | I enjoyed the first one but wanted more power period | I got it now | Love the sound with the dual exhausts | This is my dream car | Ready to take a long trip | Love the compliments | 
 "words": I cant believe I bought a KIA I cant believe I bought a KIA | Will take delivery the day after Mardi Gras if all the paperwork goes through | By accident I looked at one and did a lot of research online and talked with a lot of people | Everybody that owned a Kia was happy | My kids are embarrassed for me one has SL500- SL55 S55 and GL450 other one has Lexus 460 and Yukon XL and others | They are just too yuppie | I am convinced I will be very happy with this car even if the buying decision may not have been smart | I will report back after a couple of weeks driving | Just couldn't see spending 12000 more for an Infinity M35 | Amanti nice car not an ICON to impress others | Hope it works
