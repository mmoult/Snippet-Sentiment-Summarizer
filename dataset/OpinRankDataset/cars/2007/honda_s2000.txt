REVIEWS
 "words": I leased my S2000 for three years | It is a fun car to drive but it is not economical | It has power but it doesn't have much room for anything | I guess as long as you are single and are not planning to go on a trip with it then you are ok | Otherwise there isn't much room in the car or in the trunk | I could never get a suitcase to fit | Again it is a great car but perhaps for college kids who have time to drive around and are skinny enough to fit in it | I always had to watch who I offered a ride to not everyone will fit in it | 
 "words": This is the second S2000 I've owned | The first one was the 2001 version | This car is amazing | The power curve is smooth and the handling is even better | The looks of the exterior is classic | Since I've owned it I've added full race suspension to it and upgraded the wheels to forged 18x7 | 5 front and 18x9 in the rears | The car was also lowered about 2 inches all around | The car handles so much more better although comfort was slightly compromised the benefits greatly outweighed the feeling of having just a normal ride not that the factory suspension wasn't stiff enough | I'm an auto enthusiast and have owned more powerful cars in the past but this car the least say is the most fun of all | 
 "words": I am the proud owner of a 2007 Silverstone Black S2000 | What a gorgeous car | Aging exterior design | The lines are simple fluid aggressive and classic | Beautiful today | Beautiful 20 years from now | Dated interior | Your speed in big red numbers so you can't miss it | A bar tachometer shaped like the horsepower curve | AC and stereo controls at your fingertips | Comfy leather seats hold you tight in turns | The top goes up and down in a snap | Engine performance | How many cars put out more than 100 hp per liter even in 2008 | Drive it like a Miata and you'll get Miata-like performance mpg | Punch it and you have a rocket | A 6-speed four-wheeled sport bike pure and simple | 
 "words": I finally got my 2007 S2000 last Tuesday July 29 | I had been test driving different S2000's at dealers reading road tests and reviews and researching them on the internet for about 6 months | I have been an auto enthusiast most of my life and have owned many performance cars and two corvettes | I will have to say that the Honda S2000 is the most fun car to drive that I have ever owned | It's not the fastest or the most powerful or the most comfortable but it does so many things so well | I can't drive this car without smiling | By the way I'm 66 years old | My son told me the S2000 wasn't practical | I replied that I was too old to be practical | 
 "words": Have only owned the roadster for a week but have researched for years being an enthusiast of this gem | Why pay 20- 30000 more for a name like Porsche or Bimmer when you only get the cache' and moreover major league repair costs | Driving behavior was better than expected with the point and squirt steering which is as predictable as you will find | Power is as well better than expected | The torque at lower RPM in V 2 | 2 was desperately needed and now that has been addressed | 8 model years and still going strong | Not many cars are produced this long and still sell like hot cakes | CR version would likely be my next car | 
 "words": Have had the car for nearly a year now and the driving experience has been great | BUT now for the warning | The S2000's seats and parts for that matter are hot parts with young kids souping up their little cars | My car was completely stripped | seats steering wheel radio airbags and carpet right in front of my own house | If you are to purchase this car make sure you have a garage or a very good aftermarket alarm | If not stay clear of the car | I now have an alarm but I still have that fear of someone stripping it again | 
 "words": I've owned lil red for 3 months | This is the first sports performance car I've owned so I can offer no comparisons but can say I have no disappointments | Very impressed with the build quality and I see no flaws in performance | This car is equally at home cruising downtown or screaming through the hills and it never gets finicky just purrs along ready for anything | Hitting vtec is nice esp if you have some room to play | 8k rpm 70 mph in 3rd and you still have 3 more gears | Steering is very linear suspension is firm but not punishing | This car makes no mistakes but will certainly point out yours if you like sports cars you'll probably love it | 
 "words": I have lusted over the Honda S2000 ever since it arrived on the scene | I have had a '91 Alfa Romeo Spider Veloce and a '96 Mazda Miata | I love my new convertible except on the freeway | Driving above 60 mph scares me and I feel like I'm going to lose control of the vehicle around freeway bends | There is major fish-tailing involved and I oftentimes struggle to regain control of the vehicle if I am driving anywhere over 60 mph | In Texas driving less than 70 mph on the freeway is a death- sentence | 
 "words": Had this car for 2 months loved it it's a true roadster convertible | A real Honda enthusiast's car | I miss it | See some thugs ripped my top and stole the seats out of my car | Took 3 weeks to order them from Japan they come in pieces and couldn't drive it for 3 weeks | Worst of all it happened in front of my house | So I had to get rid of it | I regret it | But couldn't deal with the stress of getting up every day and possibly dealing with this happen again | If you get one | Please get seat locks and a really good factory alarm it will save you a huge head ache like I wish I had avoided | 
 "words": I've owned two sports cars a 1980 Corvette and the 2007 Honda S2K | The Honda gets my vote | I purchased the Berlina Black | The only color for a fast stealthy sportster | I was a bit disappointed about 20 somethings not gasping at this beauty but I guess they gasp at Prius' instead | Had to wait for mileage to reach 1000 before really turning on the V- Tec above 6000 | Wow this engine is incredible | Nothing like winding 8000 in third gear | Even the fellows in F- 150's take notice | Best features external beauty beautiful wheels clean interior exceptional assembly | Best attributes loud throaty roar of the engine | stiff hard solid ride | this is a car for drivers | 
 "words": This is the best bang for the buck for a true sports car | When I run it in the mountains it wants to go harder than I am willing to take it and I run it pretty hard | The Corvette I drove had more power but inferior fit and finish compared to the S2000 | and a much higher price tag | This is a fine true sports car in every way | 
 "words": The S2000 is a driver | s car | The steering is quick and precise | It turns on a dime and handles curves like it | s on rails | The brakes are superb and it has excellent power delivery even below the VTEC range | For day-to-day driving the mileage is excellent however it does require premium gas | If you use the VTEC mode a lot expect the mpg to drop significantly | The overall driving experience is exhilarating particularly if you live in an area where there are lot of curvy roads preferably mountain roads | It's best stress relief known | It's even fun to drive back and forth to work | In summary this is a uncompromising sports car that will delight anyone who loves driving | 
 "words": I owned a 2003 and the 2007 has a little more giddy-up and better audio | My opinion hasen't changed since 2003 | You won't find a better fun car at under 35G | This car will handle itself rather well against any car I've come across except for the Corvette | However in a series of S turns the Vet couldn't keep up | It's insane how the S2000 handles all styles of cornering | I know the tires have a lot to do with it but still | 
 "words": Owned many cars over the years several being of the sports variety | This car smokes | The only bad point if you could call it that is everyone that sees you wants to race | Their mistake this car eats everything alive | 
 "words": This vehicle will not run with a Corvette so do not even try | However with that being said there is no other like it | The S2K is in a class all by itself when handling and looks are considered | The S2K is typical Honda quality with a fairly good amount of Honda's racing heritage mixed in | The 2 | 2L V-Tec doesn't produce a lot of low end torque but above 6K on the tachometer you better hold on | I recently had the chance to trade for a 2007 Boxster S and I just could not bring myself to do it | I love this car | 
 "words": I always wanted to have an S2k when they said that they're gonna stop selling in a year or two I decided to get one | I've always driven automatic and I was nervous when I test drove this car | But it easy to drive this car | If the engine dies one push of a button and you're back in business | The top goes up and down pretty fast | The seats are comfy | It doesn't have a lot of oohs and aahs as far as features are concerned uber sound sys etc | But I pretty much knew about it before I bought the car | And the engine | I have to always check myself because they just passed a law in VA about speeding 20 miles over | It's gonna hurt | I'm gonna keep this car even if I decide to get another car | 
 "words": I fell in love with a cousin's red Austin Healy when I was a teenager | What a rush | Nearly 40 years later I get that same rush with my red S2K | We lost our 2000 Accord to a rear end accident earlier this year | I love Honda and felt it would be only right to replace the old Accord with another Honda | A wild hair steered me to the S2000 | It's been only a month or so but I can't get enough of it | We went on a near 5 hour mountain ride this weekend through some winding roads in Georgia North Carolina and Tennessee | My automatic transmission legs were worn out but the thrill was a true heart pumper | It's my version of a safe Harley all the fun and none of the risk | Why did I wait so long | 
 "words": I find myself driving this car far more than I need to simply because it's such a blast to drive | The razor-sharp reflexes the confident solid shift action the punch of VTEC when you crack past 6 grand not to mention the banshee scream that comes with that- need I say more | There is a surprising amount of leg room more than my Accord and the well-bolstered seats really keep you planted during spirited driving | While the storage space leaves a bit to desire after a couple weeks I didn't find it to be an issue anymore | 
 "words": I have previously own Porsche boxter and was not sure about this trade | I'm so glad I did | This car is a great performer on long highway trips | Great pick up and aerodynamic style really performs well cutting thru air flow | Can get bit of interior upgrade power windows trunk opener all can be moved to center console for easy access | Top roof can used more padding | Better stereo system and more comfortable padding for car seat should be standard at this price | This car has so many potentials Honda need to continiue production and make small improvements for future models without any major price alterations | My advice buy this car | Learn to drive it and you will be satisfied | 
 "words": I have had five sports cars over my 40 plus years of driving and this S2K is by far the best overall driving machine I have ever had the pleasure of operating | 
 "words": My wife has owned every boxster style car known to man | It's amazing to me how cheap the S2000 is compared to the others | This car is simply the best | 
 "words": I've owned my 2007 S2000 since Jan | 3 2007 and am absolutely enthralled with it | Responsive yes | Fun yes | Powerful yes | Comfortable yes | Like a glove | Now I'm a fairly slim guy 5' 11 155 lbs | and fit in the cockpit like medium snug which is good | Great gearbox | Great steering | Great suspension | All in all a truly exhilarating ride and driving experience | As a former Miata owner this is THE TRUE ROADSTER SPORTS CAR | Get one | 
 "words": Just recently purchased the 2007 S2000 after nearly 6 months of car shopping | Reviewed all other cars in class Z4 TT etc | Kept on coming back to the S2000 | It's speed handling and beautiful lines had me at Rev Rev | It is truly a pleasure to drive | One drive and you will be hooked | 
 "words": After driving my BMW convertible for 12 yearsthis car has made me realize what a true sports car convertible should be | 
 "words": Hi Everyone I just wanted to warn you about my S2000 experience | This past weekend I bought a brand new 2007 S2000 from a dealership in Loma Linda CA | I took a night delivery so I couldn't fully inspect the vehicle particularly the interior | Over the next 2 days as I spent more time in the car I noticed bumps on the dashboard | Think swells each the size of the top of a pencil eraser | Some were larger totaling about 10 of them | I pressed on these bumps found voids underneath as opposed to the usual firm sponge | I attempted a swap but the dealership will not work with me the car had less than 300 miles on it | I am now stuck with a 33k car waiting to be disassembled | 
 "words": The Honda S2000 has a nice design and a rather tight interior | The quality of the vehicle is outstanding and the engine transmission and drive train are awesome | The latest models have a nice range of refined low RPM torque and driveability | The Honda is quiet and behaved on city streets until you decide to wind it up | Then the horses kick in with a rush of power that is best experienced descriptions don't do the experience justice | Handling is crispresponsive and predictable | The S2000 goes around corners like it is on banked rails and it stops quickly with good pedal feedback and linear response | The transmission is a joy short throws silky gear shifts | Puts your mind in another place | 
 "words": Hands down the hottest roadster on the market | Classic lines great performance Honda quality | Sorry to all my s2k colleagues | nothing beats Black on Black | 
 "words": I owned a 2005 S200 for about a year before it was stolen | The car is awesome but have now learned that the S2000 is a hot target for parts | My car was stolen and found a few days later completely stripped wheels headlights taillights seats steering wheel airbags door panels stereo etc | This was my second theft incident with the same car and have heard plenty of similar stories | I would absolutely recommend the car but only if you can keep it safe in a garage | 
 "words": Driving the S2000 for the first time took my breath away | Its handling is superior and the power was out of this world |
