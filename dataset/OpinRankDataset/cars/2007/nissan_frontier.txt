REVIEWS
 "words": If you plan to drive your Nissan Nismo off road as it is intended as it is a 4x4 and Nismo is the off road version of the Frontier then before you go off road make sure you go to a 4x4 shop and have thick plastic cut out and put in the area by the back wheel well that sticks out | they have clear plastic there already for that purpose but it is not thick enough nor is it big enough | My Nismo has the rear locker and in 2 years I have never been stuck with the truck yet and this last winter just about wore my 3x30'tow rope out by pulling everone else out from the record snow that we received | bought new tires and went with the General Grabber AT2 which will get you way more traction | 
 "words": Looked at all small trucks and this was by far the best out there | Had for 2 | 5 years and never had any problems even the mileage is better than I thought | Would buy again but will be keeping this for years to come | 
 "words": Truck has a very WIDE turning radius | I am always up on the curb or blocking the road | Not good for tight turns anywhere | 
 "words": This is a very quiet truck well made excellent power rides great tows a 4000lb travel trailer very well | I recommend it | Nits and picks turning radius is poor radio has weird controls edge of rear tail light not shielded from breakage if tail gate is down | broke it first load of long planks | You lose your traction control if you install aftermarket wheels and tires w o tire pressure senors | 
 "words": Ordered this 2dr Nismo after reading Edmunds 2006 review | rated Frontier as 1 and again in 2007 | Super solid crisp handling fantastic acceleration impossible to get stuck comfortable ride | just one tough truck | This will be a keeper for a longlong time | 
 "words": Love this truck 21 mpg is a joke unless you are driving Miss Daisy expect 17-18 at best | Solid build minus the rattle that will never go away | TIRE SENSOR OR TIRE | Front tire increases and decreases pressure constantly dealer can not find problem and the sensor comes on every day | Very comfortable roomy and stylish | 
 "words": I have had this truck for two years and use it for everything commuting mountain biking skiing etc | Lots of power great on and off road handling excellent on snow and ice | The crew cab long bed is perfect | I can fit a crew of 4 with 2 dogs and 4 mountain bikes and travel in comfort to far away destinations | I drove all the other crew cab trucks and it came down to the Frontier and the Tacoma I am very pleased to have chosen the Frontier | 
 "words": I have owned my 2007 Frontier Nismo for a month now purchased used | Fuel mileage is steady around 18mpg city | I have yet to take it on a trip along highways | It is a bit rougher ride than my neighbors 2006 Frontier XE due to the Nismo package | I would like to have his fuel economy but the towing capacity of mine will be handy with a boat and camper | The ride would be better with different tires | The electronic locking rear differential comes in handy when pulling a boat out of the water at the boat launch | Overall I would give this truck a well deserved A rating | 
 "words": I love this truck my daughter calls it the goat | The gas mileage at 60 is 24 mpg and it rides very nice | I can't complain if anything its way over built | Power to spare and very roomy great ergonomics |

 "words": I would agree with most of what I have read about this truck I traded a 2003 ranger 4 liter4wd the ranger was 4 10 gears and would outperform the nissan in 1 4 mile the nissan is quiet good ride eye appealing nice and roomy compared to the ranger seats take some adjustment to get right console is shortmileage is about the same as the ranger less than 20 mpg I have been a Ford truck guy for years so far I am pleased with the nissan | I would have liked the cruise controls to light up se with the value truck package is a good buy in my opinion | 
 "words": I've had my Frontier LE for about 3 weeks | not really long enough to review it yet but i like this truck so much that I couldn't wait | I had a full size 2005 GMC Sierra before this and the Nissan is 10 times more refined in just about every way | I am ALWAYS more impressed by products from Japanese companies compared to GM products I've owned | Tacoma can't even beat this one | Frontier wins in power ride handling refinement etc | 
 "words": what a shame a good truck except for horrible gas mileage and very scary abs braking on ice or snow I will be getting rid of this truck
 "words": A very well-built and nice looking truck fun to drive plenty of power | The towing cap | is very good | 
 "words": Just got my Frontier a week ago and I'm loving every minute I get to drive it | Very powerful and the Rockford Fosgate stereo is great | The leather feels great too | 
 "words": Just purchased another Nissan truck and I must say the Frontier is a heck of a truck | Have a '95 Nissan truck already and it has more than 356000 miles with no mechanical issues | It doesn't look like it is going to ever wear out | Wanted to update to something newer and got a great deal | Everything works perfectly and I really like the brawny appearance | I expect this one to last me 15 years or more | 
 "words": My Frontier offers me all that I want in a truck | It has a box large enough to handle my hauling needs a powerful engine to get me up the hill I live on and 4WD for upstate New York winters | I bought a Nissan for the reliability over Chevy | 
 "words": Had this truck one month 900 miles | I like it better every time I drive it | The seats take some getting used to | The ride is a little bumpy in town but great on the highway | I don't care much for the tool box basket behind the drivers seat or the jump seats | The main issue is fuel mileage | So far I am getting 16 mpg combined driving | I gave up a Ford Ranger I had for 12 years that performed very well | This truck has more power and is very quiet on the highway | So far not a single issue to report | 
 "words": Have had a Chevy 1500 in the past just traded in my Xterra | This truck has impressed me since the day I bought it | Great power smooth ride | Gas mileage better than the 2002 xterra even with the bigger engine | I have friends with Fords Dodges all 2005 or newerthat are full sized would pick this truck every time | Price is great | performance even better | 
 "words": After drivinga Ford Ranger for several years and a Chevy Colorado for 1 year this truck is a dream to drive | Much smoother and quieter than the other small trucks that I have driven in the past | This truck also has more power than I will ever use and at the same time has a good gas mpg rating for a truck | Back seat works great for extra passengers or folds flat for extra interior cargo space | So far it rates a 10 | 
 "words": Bought the truck recently and have from the 1st drive been very impressed | Kept in low rpms the truck is sedate and quiet but above 3000 it moves and growls | The interior is the best made of any recent Nissan even on my cloth SE every surface is nice to the touch | Lots of cubbies and drink holders too | The exterior looks great again even on the SE you get a good amount of nice Chrome | The standard spray on bedliner and 4 wheel disk brakes are great features | Finally I got this V6 4wd for best same as a 'best offer' on a 4cyl 4wd Tacoma | It wasn't even a competition | 
 "words": This truck is awesome | I looked at Toyota but the style of the frontier sold me on Nissan | The 1500 incentive was also nice | The larger alloy wheels looked so much nicer then then the standard ones and you can get them with the SE value package | It's a good deal | You get the bed extender cruise power VSS mats and the wheels for around 1300 | It really makes a huge difference in my opinion | The gas mileage stinks but so does Toyota | It's a 4X4 truck so you should expect that | I ended up paying 23500 after the incentive but the dealer gave me less then I wanted for a trade so figure I really spent 24500 | Not a bad deal | I'm very happy with the truck and recommend it over Toyota | 
 "words": We compared several trucks for the last few weeks | Ford they wanted too much for the Sportrac | Toyota they don't make any deals and the rest are the rest | This is my wife's car and she loves it because it handles as a car on the highway and as a truck in the country | The only complain so far are the seats | they need more support and the arm rest are out of place | Over all it is very nice truck with a teen looking | 
 "words": 'Bought a Hardbody new in '87 | best purchase I ever made | 'Bought the Frontier last weekend | great truck | 'Looking forward to a lot of miles with this one too | Avalanche color with Steel cloth interior | Alloys | 6' bed | Nice ride | Smooth quick motor | Seamless cruise engagement | More rear leg-room than the '98 F-150 cab-and-a- half LWB I traded in | I've read comments about the large turning radius but it's more maneuverable that the Ford | Shopped for seven weeks before settling on this one | definitely worth the wait | 
 "words": Traded my truly excellent 2005 Tundra TRD 4x4 for this smaller truck | But don't let it fool you- the bed is quite nearly the same size | Acceleration is better and my max noted MPG was 21 on the hwy the other morning | Avg MPG seems to be 17 | 5 to 18 | 5 | The NISMO 4x4 drives like a car- the suspension is tight and accurate low center-of-gravity for a 4x4 but has enough clearance for most Jeep trails in TX | WAY more power than the Tacoma with more features for less money | Had a Titan before the Tundra and it was junk but Nissan has been making compacts much longer than they have been making full-sized | Give the Titan another couple years | Enjoy the Frontier today | 
 "words": This is my first p u and the vehicle is very nice to drive | Smooth quietand handles very well | The 5 speed auto shifts nicely and the engine has excellent power | The ride is not busy on the highway | I drove a Tacoma with similar equipment and found it to be not has sure footed | The ride in the Tacoma was unsettled at highway speeds | The Rockford Fosgate stereo is very nice indeed | I have the leather interior it is very comfortable | Even my wife likes to drive it | We have owned Nissan cars since 1987 and we were never disappointed | 
 "words": Bought new in Oct | Great powervery fast | Very nice clean design interior and exterior | 4wd works very well in the snow | Better than expected fuel mileage approx 19mpg avg | Excellent value | A few small gripes show that I am spoiled and have forgotten how crappy my Ford was A small squeak that comes from the back right corner of the cab large turning radius lots of wind noise interior plastic scratches way too easily | Inside is nice and clean in design but could use some more luxurious touches like Tacoma | Still a great Value I would buy another one | 
 "words": Great vehicle with stunning design | Perfect size matched with awesome power | Not too big but big enough to do just about anything | with great features all about | Great purchase | 
 "words": Not impressed with build quality | Drive train is great interior rattles n' shakes | Have had numerous small issues with gas gage and rattles | Dealer service is absolutely the worst | Tried multiple dealers and all provided the worst service I have ever seen | Mechanics were poorly trained and management had a go away attitude | This is not the Nissan I have loved in the past | I sold an F150 to get better gas mileage in the city and I miss it | 
 "words": I have only had my Frontier for a few weeks but by far it is a great improvement over my 2005 F150 | Had tranny problems with that at 15000 miles | Got tired of fighting it and traded off | This is faster drives better and gets way better mileage then F150 | great value | Toyota was way out of line on price and a dog compared to this Frontier | 
 "words": After researching all the medium and small size trucks my choice was the Nissan Frontier | All the nice features style design make it a better choice | The Toyota Tacoma would be my second choice but I paid 2500 less for a Frontier with the same choices | Plus those sales guys at Toyota are really difficult they want you to pay MSRP and don't like to deal | The new Long bed on the Frontier makes it an excellent choice if you compare the size of the bed to the Titan there is not much difference | I love my truck | 
 "words": I really like the engine handling ride and features of my Nissan | The only dislikes I have are the too soft seats and the turning radius | It is really hard to park in tight parking lots | I average between 17 and 18 mpg so far | Overall I really like this truck | 
 "words": This truck was the best of all the midsized trucks I drove | It had the smoothest ride | Better than the Tacoma | It seemed to have more power also | During the first highway drive home my wife fell asleep so that speaks to the comfort both of the ride and of the seats | The 5 speed automatic Transmission shifts smoothly and not too frequently I believe this is because of the excessive torque of the engine | It does not have to down shift very often | The truck weighs more than the Tacoma this gives a better ride and a stronger truck for less money | If you are wondering How I liked the Ford the Dodge or the Chevy lets just say I bought the Nissan and leave it at that | 
 "words": Picked over Tacoma for price and overall exterior design | Looks more like a truck | Power is great fuel ok hopefully will get better once broken in | 
 "words": I went from a Land Rover Freelander and to a Nissan Frontier 4WD and feel that I have made an excellent choice | Very surprised by the power for a mid- sized truck very comfortable and a nice ride | 
 "words": I love the drive train and suspension on this truck it drives like a sports car and is a blast to run the 2 | 5L 4 banger through the gears | My complaint | I can't find a comfortable position for the driver's seat | The door panel encroaches on my leg space the front lip of the seat digs into my thighs and the seat bottom back is just plain hard | I'm now considering options such as a custom seat upgrade seats from a wrecked SE LE or possibly reupholstering | The uncomfortable seats are starting to sour me on an otherwise wonderful truck | 
 "words": Driving my mom's tacoma trd after my nismo frontier i noticed this The frontier is noticeably faster more powerful | The steering is easier in the tacoma | The frontier had more hip knee room | Tacoma is quieter | Fronter is sportier | Tacoma sits a tad higher | Frontier has much better price | Tacoma has prettier interior | Frontier has better functionality of interior | Tacoma has nicer wheels | Frontier gets better mileage 19avg vs | 16avg | for tacoma | Tacoma has better bed | Frontier has nicer one piece fenders | Trucks are essentially equal | The difference is Frontier is sportier and for young people | Tacoma is more luxurious and for older people | oh yeah frontier has real chrome bumpers | like em both
 "words": I bought this truck after comparing with the Tacoma | The Tacoma is 5 grand more money and the Nissan has the power | The truck has a real solid feel | The utility track system in the bed is a great idea and I am looking forward to the first time I have to tie something down | When the truck is idling you can tell it is a powerhouse | I haven't owned it that long to encounter any problems | I haven't had any so far | Hopefully I won't | Fuel economy could be better but you can't have it both ways | I had a Matrix | 32mpg but no power or size | This truck has some weight to it and is a real powerhouse
 "words": I traded in an 05 KC Frontier for this one and I have not been disappointed | There was nothing wrong with the 05 I just needed more room | I got the SE CC Longbed and just love it | 
 "words": Not much change from the '06 but the value power package new in '07 is a must | Not as smooth over rough roads as my Ranger | The power is awesome | I know gas mileage is a common complaint but I'm getting over 21 mpg in town | And it's supposed to get better once the engine gets broken in | I only got 19 with my Ranger with a much smaller engine | The turning radius is well non-existent | Don't try a U-turn at an intersection | The transmission is incredible smooth | I cannot feel it shift | Overall I'm very impressed with the look and quality | 
 "words": I needed a truck | After I got this one I wasn't getting the mpg I thought I should | Well one night I was on the interstate and I went just below 2000 rpm about 1800 and locked in the cruise control | My mpg went up to over 24 | My speed was about 65 | With the present gas prices this might help you get some better mpg | Now I don't feel so bad | I like this truck | Mine is a 2 wheel drive Nismo with automatic | My best mpg is 27 using this method | I avg about 24 on the highway | Around town 17 like everyone else | Hope this helps | You can go up to just about any speed and cut your rpms to about 1800 or a little above and improve your mpg | 
 "words": Very fun truck to drive | Practicle especially since it has bigger capabilities than it's size | One downfall is the service provided by Nissan | Every problem that has occured with this truck was turned into a big headache for myself | Currently my dealer refuses to acknowledge that my 6spd clutch has a defect and wants to charge me over 1200 for a new one | I officially documented the complaint at 15k miles though I had the issue from new | There are several cases of this specific defect which should be warrantied | My dealer refuses | Love the truck hate the service and I reccomend buying an automatic due to relaiability | This is not the only problem with the truck just the most prevelant
 "words": I absolutely love my truck | It drives smoothly quietly has lots of power and looks awesome too | 
 "words": Bought new to replace an '01 2wd Crew Cab SE which was a great truck | I was moving to the Midwest and wanted 4wd | Great advances since then better in all aspects to the '01 | Great motor with acceptable mileage for a truck | I get about 15-16 city 21 highway | Some folks don't like the interior but I don't mind the plastic | It's put together well and easy to keep clean | Gauges controls are clear logically ordered | Sound quality of speakers is good | I primarily an iPod via the aux jack | There is an iPod interface on the 2008s | Get that instead of the disc changer if you can | You might want to consider step rails as it's relatively high off the ground | 
 "words": I bought this truck new and have 20000 of problem free miles on it | Test drove other midsize trucks and this was the best one by far | I could be like a lot of other people and say the fuel economy could be better but it's a truck and I expect it | 
 "words": This one great truck | Previous Ford owner and this truck will out perform the Ranger hands down | The the power is incredible | The six speed tranny boosts the fuel economy to 21-23 | the other manufacturers better get it together if they are going to keep up with Nissan on this one | 
 "words": The Frontier crew cab has nice road feel stable and solid a comfortable ride and great space utilization options behind the driver seat | I think with a few improvements options it could fit the needs of lots more customers than it currently attracts and could be a perfect choice for those of us looking for an all around vehicle with versatility and don't need a truck for towing or offroading | 
 "words": This truck is great I've shopped the competition and found this to be the best deal | I'm getting 18 | 9 mpg average in summer and 17 | 8 average in winter | I've upgraded to 89 octane this winter for a 1-2 mpg boost | you may get 16 mpg in the cold on 87 octane | I'm gonna try 93 and see if it is overall cheaper or not | I've got 6000 miles on the truck and have had no problems at all | the 4wd works great snow and hills are nothing | Great truck | 
 "words": The frontier king cab is pretty nice it does have some flaws that you have to look for | The king cab is ok if you are going to put a baby back there | I would go with a crew cab next time also the interior is cheap looking but that's ok it's a truck | The clock radio should be different color can't read if the sun is out | I do hear a noise under the dash board sometimes and also when I spin the tires I hear a funny noise the wide turn stinks | Overall the truck is nice if you are looking for room for back passengers definitely go with the crew cab | Fuel mileage could be better for a 6 cyl | Also my brakes squeak a lot | 
 "words": Bought truck in Jan '07 have irritating 'clanging rattling' sound that occurs at medium rpm around 30 mph | Sounds like a heat shield | Took to Niisan dealer was told it was the catalytic converter that there was nothing they could do | This is unnaceptable for a 23k truck | Very comfortable good power OK mileage for a truck | Base radio is a joke | Heavy tailgate | Headlights are slightly dim | 
 "words": I wrote a review called '3 Months and still love it' | I have now driven my truck in both summer and winter live in the Northeast | I have also gotten over my initial 'new car happy' feeling but believe me I'm still very happy with my truck | I took fuel economy down one notch because in four wheel drive I know it's depressingly low | All vehicles are low in 4WD though so don't skip this truck because of that | The power is still great handles like a dream and there has been ZERO snowpiles or unplowed roads that I could not get through | I live in a city built on a hill where they don't know how to plow and I still haven't had a single problem in the snow | 
 "words": I traded in my 2006 Tundra sr5 4x4 doublecab for the Frontier | it outshines the toyota by miles | parking cornering in tight situations gas mileage you name it | It's too bad more people don't test drive these trucks 'cause they rock | 
 "words": My dad owned a 03 frontier and has had zero problems in about 4 years with 60ish thousand miles so I figured I'll go with a Nissan | Bought the truck used and use it to read meters in central florida and the truck rides pretty darn good | Had to put a small lift kit on it for ground clearance but the truck can take a beating and keep on going | Dislikes are horrible blindspot on the kingcab and not so great turning radius which everyone else has stated | Tows my 18' flats boat pretty good can't complain for a 4 banger | But overall great truck with great style | 
 "words": We have had Nissan cars before so when we decided to get a truck the Frontier or Titan were the options to consider | After test drive of a Frontier the choice was real easy | We have just over 4000 miles in two months no issues what so ever so far | First cross country drive 1600 miles towing a 1000 LBS trailer with a 4000 LBS load we got 17 MPG second longer drive no trailer but a SNUG bed cover we got 21 MPG I'm sure we'll see 23-25 MPG when we have put 20000 miles or so on it | By the way all my driving is at max legal speed but from a stand still I don't floor it I can spare the lost 10 seconds | 
 "words": I use my Frontier for a variety of tasks | I haul drinks for a vending machine business | I use it for hauling materials for the home improvement projects | and I just recently drove it from Baton Rouge to Atlanta for the SEC Championship | It is a solid truck | The only complaint is the poor turning radius | One more thing if you put in an aftermarket radio it will mess up the airbag system which only the dealer can fix for an 89 charge | 
 "words": Test drove a Tacoma didn't like the car like interior | Then drove the Frontier and loved it | I have owned it for 8 months now a have no regrets | 
 "words": I have been driving wifes 03 F150 and needed something for myself so I got a fairly good deal on the frontier | The ride is rougher which for me is just fine | 
 "words": Have owned two Ford 4x4 F-150s and a Ford Ranger 4x4 this truck crushes all three in terms of power reliability fun factor off-road performance ride and overall quality | Hauls three kids 4000 lb boat and all our gear with room power to spare | Blasted through 12-24 inch snow drifts before any plows had a chance to clear the roads after a nasty Michigan storm | Have pulled many friends' full sized domestics from sloppy mudholes while hunting fishing up north | Drive around 22000-25000 mi per year no issues as of yet | Use roof rack in conjuction w cargo basket more than I thought I would | Bedliner tiedowns great | 
 "words": Wanted a four door pickup to get me to work pick up groceries and occasionally haul a couple of 2x4s or a couple to dinner | Truck is too big and overpowered for my needs but a compromise and the best overall choice for me compared to a Tacoma Canyon Sport Trac | Lots of minor irritations in the interior design but the Nissan reputation for reliability was a big selling point for me | 
 "words": I was test driving the Frontier and the Tacoma left and right but I had to go with the Frontier | Since then it has been great | I love the power mostly but I'm getting between 18 and 20 MPG which is slow city and highway mixed together | Wish there were a few more features available with the SE model rather than having to upgrade to the NISMO like a 6K step up | Wanted a better sound system and spray in liner | Nothing I can't do aftermarket though | Plus I can drive on 87 fuel who wants to pay for 91 in the Tacoma | 
 "words": Drives smooth sharp interior very nice to drive | I am very happy with my Nissan Frontier | The only drawback would be the small seats in the king cab so if you need more room for passengers you should go with the double cab rather than the king cab | 
 "words": Traded an '06 Honda Ridgeline for the Frontier SE and I am extremely happy with my decision | The Ridge was an okay vehicle but not a true truck | The short bed was a negative the squatting of the rear end while towing was not acceptable and the mileage was pitiful at 13 to 14 mpg | The Frontier is a great good looking real truck with ample towing capacity 6500 with the V-6 great looks good ride and a very powerful with a lot of torque V- 6 engine | My full size motorcycle fits very well in the bed and when towing a trailer you don't even notice you are pulling something back there | This truck will burn rubber any time you want to from a dead stop | 
 "words": I love this truck its very capable off-road and hauls it all around town and on the freeway | I have just under 7k on it and I get the occasional squeak noise from under the dash paint chips semi-easily and does GREAT on the freeway but badly around town | Gas pedal takes a bit to rev | Interior shows scratches like mad | Otherwise love the looks features power | 
 "words": Was set on a Tacoma | Looked at the Frontier in the 11th hour | The stock and option values were better | The 6 is a great value for lots of extra power but I wont be doing any heavy hauling | Also nice to have that extra power on tap but as the price of gas goes up-my need for speed goes down | The 2 | 5 isnt exactly a small 4 anyway | I took mine through the gears 3000 rpm and found the power more than adequate | It's too new to check the gas mileage but I'm sure it will be decent after switching to full synthetic Mobil 1 | There are some minor negatives but overall this is a great truck | Perfect size | Nicest looking | 
 "words": Bought my 2007 Crew Cab 4 months ago and I love it | Traded in a 2004 Titan and love that too but the gas mileage won me over on the Frontier | Just bought another Frontier today | 
 "words": I traded in my 01 Supercharged Frontier Crew Cab 4x4 with 160K miles having had no problems with it on an 07 Frontier | The turning radius is horrible | The driver's door should have a handle on it | when open and you are seatbelted in it is hard to close | Console should be forward to use as an armrest or be moveable | The dash has several creases and pieces where dust and dirt can get just does not look finished and looks worse than my 01 dash | My gas mileage mixed driving is 17 | 7 which is 3 mpg better than my underpowered 01 SC Frontier | Love the sunroof the Nismo sits very high stereo is nice mileage read out good overall very happy | 
 "words": Looked at the Toyota Tacoma Chevy Colorado and Honda Ridgeline before buying my Frontier Crew Cab LE V6 | Frontier is better than all | it's very close to the Tacoma but the Toyota's need for premium gas turned me away | The Frontier is not perfect | the seat fabric could be better the turning radius is poor and the console is too low far back | The worst negative is the bump steer when driving at highway speeds | it's a little distracting until you get used to it keep two hands on the wheel and it's not so bad | However the acceleration is awesome I added a KN filter and gained a couple more HP | Gas mileage is what I expected avg 18 mpg hey it's a truck not a hybrid | 
 "words": So far so good about 16 | 1 MPG but that is driving the speed limit and trying to get good mileage | I wish they had left the gas tank on the passenger side few cars have it there never a line as the pump | Good build quality really nice seats for cloth like all the cup holders and the small storage area under the back seat | Seats are comfortable wish Nissan offered leather and auto seats with the Nismo | 
 "words": Was looking for a new truck and went back and forth between full midsize | Found some articles on the Fronty on internet and test drove | It was very impressive and spoke for itself | Good power handling ride quality well thought out design and ruggedness | Nissan is a player in the truck market offering quality pricing and a good reputation | 
 "words": 3rd new 4WD Nissan truck | Best yet | Performance is impressive Offroad capability with electronic rear locker is best in class | Interior comfort is car like | Compared to Tacoma better ride better interior especially seats | No comparison in options | 
 "words": My first Nissan and I like it | I've owned ford chevy mazda jeep and I like this Nissan more in the first thousand miles that I drove it than I ever did the others | The reviews that are bad on this truck they are really nit picking this truck | My wife and I really like this truck | I drove a tacoma and a ford ranger | this was the better choice | 
 "words": Okay I was in love with the truck at first sight but the gas mileage mpg was bad | Still very shocked that the fuel economy on this truck was that low | I am driving mostly on the freeway and I am only getting 18-19 mpg | The turning radius is abysmal | I have driven smaller and larger trucks and both had better turning radiuses | The radio stinks | Also the the trim on the steering wheel started to rub off | Did you know they use black plastic with a silver finish | They should keep it black so there will not be any rubbing off | 
 "words": This is a very fun truck to own | It replaced a stolen F-150 which I liked very much but this is actually more truck for the money | Gas mileage is what you'd expect from a 261 hp V6 and the ride is good | I love the 6M transmission and it shifts like a car | I finally got a chance to fully use the 4wd low in Escalante National Monument in Utah and I can say this truck certainly has the ability to craw up steep slopes | Overall I have been very pleased with the truck | My only complaint has been a consistent rattle on the driver's side rear door that I will have looked at under warranty | At 3500 miles I can fully endorse this truck | 
 "words": I test drove the 6-cylinder versions and the fun-factor was right off the top of the charts | I really didn't need 261 HP though and the poor mileage that went with it so I opted for the 4-cylinder XE with all the power options | It's not nearly as powerful as the 6 but the 4 cylinder is more than adequate for my needs | I'm averaging just over 21 mpg and it's improving a little with each tankful as the engine breads in | I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market | good build quality wonderful ride and fun to drive | Count me as a happy customer | 
 "words": I've only owned the vehicle for less than a week now so this review is not intended to be anything more than the title states | I'm only 5'8 and feel that the seats are made to fit my size perfectly so taller drivers may have issues with comfort | I'm generally very pleased with everything about this truck and pretty well initially convinced that I made the right purchase | Only time will tell if this is a lasting impression |

 "words": If you're looking for a vehicle that is fun to drive this is it | I took the Toyota Tacoma for a drive then the Nissan and there is no comparison | The Nissan generated much more power as soon as you touched the gas | I punched the gas on the Toyota and it could just about get out of its way | Take the both for a ride and I'm sure you will buy Nissan |

 "words": I was only looking at the Tacoma and Ridgeline when the Frontier emerged as a darkhorse | I've been very impressed all the way around | The bang for your buck factor played greatly into my decision | If you're looking at a new Tacoma at least give the Frontier a test drive | You'll be glad that you did |

 "words": I have been researching both vehicles over the past 2 months and decided to go with the Nismo Frontier Crew | I recommend everyone to test both first | The reason I chose the Nissan over Toyota was for the overall build and engineering of the truck | When you test drive the Toyota look at the liftgate then look at the liftgate on the Nissan | The liftgate on the Nissan was much thicker and more heavyduty on the Nissan | It felt like a full size truck liftgate | Also when you are test driving the Toyota spend some time and look underneath the vehicle | The components underneath seem very thin and weak where as the Nissan looks like it could take a land mine and keep going | This is a strong truck | 
 "words": Manual 4x2 air 4-cyl cruise preferred package | Power is OK for a 2 | 5L at least when I can get the gear of my choice | Pleasant drive capable of doing almost everything a light-duty truck and daily commuter vehicle could be expected to offer | I got more for my money with the Frontier | The king cab has non-adult rear seats | if you want to use them get the crew cab |

 "words": I love everything about this truck the way it looks the way it drives the cupholders the sound system seating position and yes even the fuel economy | I got 21 | 25 mpg on my last tank with mixed driving | I do use the cruise control whenever possible but I sincerely doubt there are many other V-6 4x4s out there that can make that claim | I think it will give me 23 -24 mpg for all hwy miles | The overall value is awesome | 
 "words": I checked out the Tacoma and the Ridgeline prior to purchasing the Frontier | I didn't like the Tacoma ride and the cost | The Ridgeline was very nice but not trucky enough for me | The ride and feel are so much better than the 2005 Ranger I traded | I have owned two other Nissans and this is the best yet | 
 "words": This is my 4th truck | Looks are awesome | Truck has plenty of power better than my chevy with a 305 V-8 | Cargo features are nice | Rides great | Could get a bit better fuel mileage my average is 18 Miles but I think Nissan traded performance for fuel economy | Turning radius is not good | Don't try to u-turn with busy traffic | My only complaint was driver side left foot rest took up too much space | I removed it and made a much better flat surface with rubber top worked great | 
 "words": Handsome inside and out good build quality and comfortable | Too new to tell on reliability but it's already leading me to high expectations | Not a bad little engine and an easy clutch though I wish the gear box felt more certain and direct through the stick to my hand | My only real complaint is that the truck suffers terribly from bump steer | You don't even have to be going very fast to be startled by it | Hit some bumps while going around the curve or even going straight for that matter and the wheels leave the road to come down some place different | That aside it's a nice driving truck and represents a very good value | I'm happy with my purchase | 
 "words": I researched both the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma trucks | Of the two the Nissan was a better value | It cost less to purchase had lower maintenance costs and resale was comperable based on initial purchase price after 5 yrs | The reliability is the same as the Toyota and the features are better | 
 "words": 3000 miles and running great | I have added Nissan splashguards an aftermarket sunroof and will replace the stock stereo in due course | Only disappointment is mileage | I drive mostly city and get 22 MPG which is better than sticker | 
 "words": I've had the truck about one month and so far I love it | Mine has just about every available option and is really comfortable and attractive | I haven't taken it off-road yet but the highway ride is outstanding | I compared it to the Tacoma but ended up going with the Frontier for its better ride and more available options | The Frontier also feels more powerful to me although supposedly the Tacoma is faster | Both are good trucks I just thought I got more for the money with the Nissan | Bottom line is that I strongly recommend this truck | 
 "words": The 4 doors are great for a family and the benefits of a pickup bed | Traded a 1994 Ranger for this truck | Gas mileage is the same but the power of the Nissan 4 | 0 is better than the Ford 3 | 8 dog | Getting 19 mpg it is a truck | 
 "words": My mind was already set on buying a Toyota Tacoma four door TRD truck | I just wanted to test drive the Frontier for the heck of it | I was sold on the power of the truck and the optional features that was offered | The Frontier had a lot of leg room and the seats were real comfortable | I think Nissan did their homework with the Frontier and I would pick this truck over any of the mid size trucks out there | 
 "words": This is a great truck | In the past I have had two full size trucks the last being a Nissan Titan | I was concerned about going to the Frontier because of the loss in towing capacity | I have had the Frontier for 2 months now and would say it is an outstanding truck | It is zippy and much easier to maneuver than the past two full sizers I have owned | As for towing I tow a Bobcat S130 4800 lbs at least once a week and have no trouble whatsoever | The Frontier performs without flaw | The 4-door cab will truely haul 4 people | The 4wd will really pull this truck out of trouble even towing a trailer through mud | I highly recommend this truck | 
 "words": All other trucks in this category felt small and cramped even with a crew cab | The shifting and power are AWESOME plus this truck defines versatility | I got the power package which is a must and a good deal | I love this truck | 
 "words": The crew cab LWB model has a somewhat long turning radius but it also has all the interior seating room you would want without any loss of bed space | The roof rack flip up rear seats spray-in liner tie-down system locking tailgate and other features beat the competition | The truck has lots of power and yet has a quiet ride | The ride is nice and the seating position is preferable to the Tacoma | Gas mileage in the first 3 tanks has ranged from 17 | 5 to over 20 mpg in mixed driving assuming that you don't get your foot into it too much | Gas mileage seems to be improving as the miles add up | 
 "words": Rattle trap poor mileage bad stereo | The interior scratches way way too easy for a truck | 
 "words": So far I've been more happy than not | There are the little things that everyone else mentions mpg blind spot caused by rear seat headrests console too far back and poor turning radius | If I had to pick the most annoying issue it would be the poor turning radius | I can't remember the last time I've made so many 3 point turns | It's irritating but I'm adjusting | You just have to plan out your route prior to initiating a turn | On the plus side the power is great truck is solid and smooth feels like your going 60 mph when you're actually going 80 mph and interior comfort is good | 
 "words": Thought I would update my review a few months after the purchase | The truck is running great and we've used it much more 'as a truck' than I ever expected | I have the v6 6spd manual and get roughly 18 mpg in mixed driving weighted to city traffic | An unexpected problem my wife LOVES the truck so occasionally I go outside to go somewhere and I see our old Tiberon instead of the Frontier | 
 "words": After much research on smaller pickups i'm pleased with my choice | After looking at ford and tacoma this was the obvious choice | Only had it 2 weeks but i'm happy |
