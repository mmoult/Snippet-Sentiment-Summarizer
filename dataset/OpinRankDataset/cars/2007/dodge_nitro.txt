 "words": When I first brought the nitro I loved it but after having it for only 8 months I had been in the shop 4 or 5 times for the same reason cutting off while driving and every time they would say it was fixed and it wasn't I call the main office and they said it would have to happen again for them to do anything | I had a 2 year old and could not take the changed and trade the nitro in for a Chevy truck and went upside down 6000 because we paid 24000 for the nitro and they only gave us 14000 on it | Only 8 months after we brought it | I would not tell anyone to buy this car |

 "words": Nitro drives ok but traction control comes on at random times including dry conditions on flat roads at city speeds | At 36000 miles just out of warranty I had to replace the water pump and thermostat | Was still over heating so I took it to Clear Lake Dodge and they replaced the radiator free of charge | Drivers inside door handle broke about 100 miles ago | I have no idea why | MP3 input does not work properly | All lights and gauges will fail to operate from time to time | Must have a short some where | For having 50K miles I think this is too many problems | 
 "words": I bought the Nitro on a whim but have had no regrets ever since | I've had no Major problems with the truck | The only issues i've had is i wish chrysler put a manual lumber support in the drivers seat | Now the truck is 2 years old i to have a rattle on my dash somewhere minnor issues with the remote and the overdrive is acting up activates at 45 and bogs the motor down less you speed up to over 50 or drop down yo 40 mph chrysler knows about it so dont hesitate to complain to your dealer or even chrysler about the issue before your warranty runs out | Having said all that I still luv my truck even after 2 years and I've gotten more compliments out of the nitro then any I've had |

 "words": I have had nothing but problems rattling power windows not working taillights go out now I have a noise when I tap my brakes the noise continues even if i am not applying brake my jeep had this same problem interior is plastic I have noticed transmission when shifting is problematic 
 "words": This is such a fun vehicle to drive | Unfortunately it started to rattle rattling noises inside about 7 months after purchase | It has been in the shop 4 times already | The first couple of times they tried packing foam in the offending areas | Then they decided to order new parts dash area and right rear post saying that the bevels were worn | Problem seemed to be solved for about one week and then it started all over again | Now it just seems to rattle everywhere | I'm taking it back into the shop this week | I have my fingers crossed that they will get it right this time | 
 "words": We just recently purchased a Dodge Nitro and love it | It has great performance and the car turns some heads with it's classy design | The gas mileage is great for an SUV | I drive 50 miles one way to work and back so I need good mileage | I have to say I'm very impressed so far with my Nitro and highly recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": I had new car fever and I fell in love with the looks of the Nitro | I was really enjoying the car | I took three teenagers on springbreak to Florida | On the way home while going 70 mph in the far left lane the car cut out all the lights came on for several seconds which seemed like hours the car was stalled | Thankfully it came back and we were not killed | I took the car in and after two days and being insistent on cause and repair there was an electrical module replaced | According to the Dealer who stated they had contacted the engineers there had been 10 reported problems | I hope this is the real problem and it was fixed | However now I'm leary of the car | 
 "words": We love the exterior and interior appearance of this vehicle | It is different and everyone seem to take notice of it | It is a mid size vehicle that makes you think it is much larger | Great leg room in both the front seating area and the rear seating area | We have four large dogs and this vehicle has plenty of room for them to spread out and lay down when we travel with them | 
 "words": Do not buy the Nitro at this time | I bought a 2007 and have had transmission problems that started about a month after I got it | I've taken it in for flash computer upgrades but it still has a bucking problem | I did some research and found that this is not an isolated case | It seems that corporate really doesn't know what to do | They keep sending you back to reprogram the computer to make you feel better for a while but it doesn't fix the problem | I have owned a Chevy and a Ford before this and have never had these problems | I would say to anyone looking at the Nitro | get something else or wait until they get this transmission problem taken care of | 
 "words": Dodge has done it again | After being a new model buyer of a 2004 GMC Envoy XUV I had no hesitation to try another protocol vehicle | This was a gift for my wife and I had to find a ride comparable to the Envoy but in a smaller package for gas milage improvement | Our Sunburst Orange Nitro has fullfilled and exceeded our wildest dreams | Not only is it a blast to drive but having all the options available we are extremely impressed | Not a single flaw in performance nor in the assembly of this vehicle | We highly recommend this to anyone looking for 'downsizing' their guzzling suv and not sacrifice the drive and ride | The color scheme accented with chrome creates a lot of looks as well | 
 "words": Works well in the snow of Big Bear and the sand at Pismo Beach | Very fun to drive so much fun that we have another on order and are trying very hard to sell my 2004 Toyota Sequoia | The first is an SLT w auto trans but mine will be an SXT with the manual trans | Getting all the options added to an SXT 4x4 w manual is not easy | Good thing I know the general manager at the dealership real well | 
 "words": I saw the Nitro on the lot last November just after it came out | I knew that was the next one for me Now four months later not a day goes by that someone doesn't ask what it is followed by I really like it | I still don't see many on the highway but people don't know what they're missing | It rides solid and handles well | Mileage is better than my last foreign SUV | 
 "words": I am very unhappy with my Nitro | It misses out | Tranny is very sloppy and they say this is normal | Bad gas mileage and under powered | I would not reccomend to anyone | 
 "words": No one can say that the Nitro isn't sharp as can be in the looks department | It is quite the head turner but as another wrote | that's where the good ends | I have had several new cars over the years yet none in the model release's first year | The 2007 Nitro is a prime example of why homework is important | They have many issues with this vehicle that they can't or won't address | It rides very roughly the transmission feels like it's constantly searching for whatever gear it's in the headliner squeaks against the underside of the roof it has electrical issues that cause operations to fail and it is cramped feeling inside | I traded a PT Cruiser for it so go figure | Please fix mine | 
 "words": This is a fun SUV wagon | It's a real eye catcher and you'll find yourself just looking at it or in it | It's just different | So far good on gas better then my old Dodge 2500 at about 8 mpg | Just love this ride | 
 "words": I love so many things about the Nitro standard features comfort cargo room etc | But I hate the fact it's been to the service department 3 times in the last month for the same problem 1600 2200 2400 miles | he remote keyless entry has caused the Nitro to go haywire 3 times when the unlock button is pressed | This causes the Malfunction light to come on and prevents all the computer modules from communicating with each other | First the dealer reset the computers then they replaced the main gateway computer module | Took it back today not sure what they have planned now | If they don't get it fixed this time I'll be requesting a new Nitro because other than that I love it | 
 "words": I have had this car 3 months | Great Looks 3 | 7 L | engine good track record Jeep Liberty notable refinements | 1 | 5 months later engine | s light came on | up today still on they have no clue dealer Chrysler | The third time the car stayed at dealer for four days dealer could not figure out the nature for problem | Then it was time for Chrysler | That day I drove car home with light on and still waiting for software update | The other incident I encounter twice while driving it just quit and all dashboard lights came on | The sad part is that the car is for my wife | s use and daughters instead I am driving it | Wife does not feel safe driving it thinking she might get stranded on the road | 
 "words": My 2007 Dodge SXT Nitro is loud and has no power | It makes a noise | I thought it was only mine but I went and tried out another one out and it made the same noise | I thought the engine was ticking but i had it checked out and they said it was supposed to sound like that | It's very uncomfortable to ride in | The seats sit up way too high | You dont have much foot room in the floor on the drivers side | Plus it would have been nice if they would have made it where your lights would cut on at night and cut off when the car cut off | The seats in the back needed to be moveable where I could move them back a little because the Dodge company put cupholders in the floor and my son is using them as a foot stool | 
 "words": Overall I'm not very happy with my Nitro | My biggest complaint is the road noise | With my work I have driven most every new vehicle on the market and the Nitro has far and above the most road noise | Not a lot more plastic than other SUVs but definitly feels and looks cheaper | It gives it almost a hard feel | Mechanicly no complaints enough power etc | Fuel economy isn't great but then thats not why I drive an SUV | 
 "words": I bought the Nitro for the great styling high standard feature content and room inside | After 3 days the satellite radio quit took 4 weeks to replace the antenna worked 5 days and quit again | Throttle response is horrible push the gas and wait 1 second then it revs makes it very hard to modulate with manual transmission which is unacceptable for a computer controlled engine | It reminds me of my old slant 6 Volare | Engine pulls willingly but doesn't seem like 210 horsepower gas mileage not quite up to rated but close | Engine rough and a bit noisy not up to today's standard of refinement | Center console too wide nowhere to put your feet but under the pedals | 
 "words": I bought the Nitro R T with the larger engine and boy is it fast | It really gets up and goes a lot better than my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee with the I-6 4 | 0 | Handling is great with the ESP and braking is really good as well | I love the heated leather seats rear power outlet sun roof and the best is the great comments I get from people about how it looks | A lot of people still haven't seen or heard of the SUV yet | That's what I like the best about it you don't see one of these bad boys everyday like some of the other less bolder SUVs | 
 "words": I've had my Nitro for net yet a week | So far I love it | I'm getting good gas mileage 18 city and 23-24 hwy | I love the kick from the 4 | 0L engine | Great bold styling | I get a lot of comments and questions | It's great | The R T comes with the bigger tires and nice wheels a nice extra | 
 "words": I try not to drive my Nitro everyday but I can't help it to be honest | It has enough power to keep me interested but could use a little more | Handling is smooth a guy comes up on my tail with a cough GMC Envoy and that's all he got to look at | my tail | I had the Nitro going around a 30 mile hr curve at 45 | But I also have those 20 inchers | 
 "words": Dodge can dress a vehicle up and give it some curb appeal but it ends there | Nitro underperforms for me | Quirky and cute looks on the outside are a plus | Interior is horrible | Stiff and uncomfortable seats tight width spacing odd foot room on both front driver and passenger | Overall ride fair very stiff and bumpy | Handles very well in snow but odd jerky-ness when in 4wd and moving thru parking lots low speeds 0-15 | Heating system lacks power badly and direction | Lack of freeway power to pass lags before speed engages | Overall not the vehicle I expected | Not recommended | 
 "words": We are very happy with our new Nitro | We traded in a 2005 Mustang for it so first impressions were important | Only have around 1000 miles on it and absolely love this vehicle | Great for our Wisconsin winter | The only negative we have at this point is that gas mileage is terrible hope this changes once the vehicle has broken in some | At this point we are averaging 12 13 mpg in the city and the best highway so far has been 19 mpg | In comparison I am averaging 16 mpg with my full size Dodge with a 5 | 9 engine | 
 "words": Love my Nitro RT Model | For a few thousand more you get 40 hp and 20 in chrome wheels and other little goodies | Drives and handles smaller than it looks | A sport car SUV | Get more looks than my Corvette | I see a lot of people are concerned with mpg | Reset your computer when driving on the highway | I tried it and was avg 25 mpg 65 mph | Fuel avg really drops when sitting or warming up vechicle | Have reset to 0 after 1st 1k avg 17 | 6 mpg |
