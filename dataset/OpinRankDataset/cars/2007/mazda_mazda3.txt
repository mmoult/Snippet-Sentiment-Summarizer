REVIEWS
 "words": I personally own a Mazdaspeed3 hatchback and my wife enjoyed the sedan enough to want to get a sedan so we bought one | The interior on both is very nice and almost identical | My wife loves the look of this car and it is a very sport car with nice interior and looks on the outside | I had to add a rear wing to make it look sportier and upgraded my wife's interior lighting to LED's and upgraded her headlights to HID as well as upgraded the rims to 18-inch | The stock 16s are really ugly and too narrow so the fenders stuck out like crazy adding wider and larger rims made a difference | Also the rearend is too high up so we had to install rear springs to drop the back down a bit to even it out | 
 "words": Purchased this car as a commuter 90 miles round trip up the canyons | Power is great and gas mileage is amazing | We average 35mpg climbing 2500 feet to get back home | We looked at the Corolla and the civic and there was no comparison | We went with the Mazda because of reliability power and gas mileage | It is also a much better looking car | This is our second Mazda we still own the first a 1990 Miata with 100K miles on it | 
 "words": The 3 5-door Gran Touring is a solid well put together vehicle that is fun to drive | As a suburban commuter i get 23 MPH | The original Goodyear RSA tires were bad only got 18000 miles out of them and they were terrible in bad weather | Put on slightly wider yokahama's that are terrific | This car is heavy and a bit of a pig off the line but at speed is handles well accelerates well and is comfortable | 
 "words": It's quick when you need it it looks like a sharp euro car especially in White | I've driven 85k in the 2 years I've had it not one problem except new tires no surprise | When I use Mobil 1 5-20 and drive 55 I get 40 mpg | Can you show me another non-hybrid car at this price that performs like that | at under 14k the 07 is perfect for anyone on a lower budget | The 2 | 3 engine is faster and offers more color choices but you'll lose 5 mpg | The 2 | 0 is fast enough unless you have ego issues | 
 "words": This has been one of the best cars I have owned | I live in small town Oregon so rarely ever see a freeway or a big city | Mostly I drive 60 mph between towns | My gas mileage is 30 | 5 around town and 36mpg when traveling | The manual tran is fast and fun to drive | I have had zero problems in the 2 years with only required service when needed | 
 "words": I love my mazda3 | It looks great gets good gas mileage handles great and has great features | Mine has heated seats gps leather throughout mp3 hookup and love the look of the hatchback | I have the slapshift and it gets up a lot quicker when using the stick | I recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": This was my first brand new car purchase and my first Mazda and I love this car | I thought the automatic transmission was trash so I got the manual | I get about 26 to 27 miles per gallon under mixed highway and city driving | I drive it pretty hard I can't help it | it's fun to drive | I got rid of the whip antenna and replaced it with a Shark Fin Antenna and the car looks really nice with it | My friend says it looks almost like a BMW | The car looks REALLY nice in Black | 
 "words": I love this car but would strongly recommend you get the manual transmission if you are after max fun | The automatic shift function is a joke | Off of the highway the 2 | 0L engine is almost just as fun and much better on gas plus you can avoid those terrible 17 tires | 33K so far and nothing except basic maintainace and having to buy snow tires on steel rims and new street tires on the 17 rims | 
 "words": After years of driving a thirsty pig of a Nissan Maxima I decided I wanted something smaller and more economical | The thing is I was not willing to give up the fun to drive factor | After looking at many different cars I always came back to the Mazda 3 | It provides by far the most fun in its price class | In the nearly three years I've owned this car I've been very impressed with the overall performance and quality | The steering and handling in particular are outstanding providing nearly BMW style feedback | I love this car as you could probably tell by now | I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a economical car but can't stand boring cars like the Toyota Corolla | 
 "words": Overall it's a great car | No mechanical issues at 16700 miles | It's got great pick-up and looks great | I get 27 mpg on the highway at 65-70 and I think that bites | I can get 37 out of my Focus | If I drive at 45 mph down the highway I can get to the 34 mpg range | The 17 Goodyear Eagle P tires are about worn out | I'm really disappointed with them | Almost all my driving has been highway | They have a tread wear rating of 250 | I'll be lucky to make it past the 20000 mile mark without buying new ones | Had to upgrade to the Grand Touring trim at the last moment to get the side airbags | 
 "words": This is a driver oriented compact car I've had a lot of fun driving it these 9 months but it sacrifices some comfort for handling | Exterior and interior styling is the best in the segment it's a very sharp looking little car | The fuel economy needs to be worked on though I'm only getting 20 MPG in the city very disappointing | Also there is a lot more hard plastic than the Civic but it is put together very well | Even though the Civic has some advantages over the Mazda I would still pick the 3 | 
 "words": I have owned my Mazda3 for about a month | I went and drove the new Hondas and the new Toyotas and did not even check out the American makes | For the price of the Mazda3 it out performs in acceleration handling braking and shifting | It is also more comfortable and just all around more enjoyable to drive | If you want a nice car that has a sexy design and drives well for a great price then I suggest the Mazda3 |

 "words": I've been driving my MT 3 for 8 mos | All in all I'm satisfied but there are some major engineering errors that they need to address | I added the Sirius radio after I got the car bought through the dealer but installed at an aftermarket and by doing so the aux button for my iPod no longer worked | Was told that it's either one or the other after purchase of course | Complained enough to the dealer that they gave us a comp on the switch box needed to use both sat and aux | Claimed they didn't know | Don't pay 150 for a feature that should have been there from the start | I drive 95 highway and only average 26 | 2 after 8K miles | Was told would get 30 | 
 "words": I traded an 06 Civic EX sedan 5MT w navi for the Mazda3 | What does that tell you | The Mazda is a much more drivable car | A bit more comfortable and more pep | At a cost of worse gas mileage | Getting in and out of the car is easer | Lumbar support on the driver's seat is useful | 
 "words": When I started to research this car I had no idea how awesome this car was | It looks like a very very expensive car a la Lexus or BMW | I get wows all the time and when my friends and family looked at the interior they where all impressed | This car really zooms and looks great doing it | If you want a car that looks and feels very luxurious than this is the car | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle for 3 months and feel that I can finally comment on it objectively | This is the most fun I've had owning and driving a car ever | Super comfortable driver's seat | Love the sporty design and have been impressed with the handling | Very stable around turns and corners | Great acceleration when trying to merge or pass other vehicles | So much more power than my previous 2003 Nissan Sentra or my daughter's Toyota Corolla | The gas mileage could be improved upon I'm currently averaging 26 | 4 mpg in the city and about 31 mpg on highway trips but this could be attributed to the fact I've been running the air all summer | Also has the Bose sound system which is awesome | 
 "words": I just bought the S Grand Touring with a 5 speed | I love to drive it want to go to eat at restaraunts that are farther away | I wish I lived farther from work | I had a Scion xB which had a sporty feel but the engine always sounded like it was laboring | The azda's 2 | 3L engine seems to effortlessly propel the vehicle | I think this adds to its luxurious feel | Leather seats would not otherwise make up for a loudly revving engine | I love the trip computer however now I know just how bad the gas mileage is when I drive the car like it's in a Zoom Zoom commercial | I am getting about 26 MPG right now after a few days of driving mixed freeway and city | I expect 35ish on the road trips |

 "words": I was reluctant to purchase the Mazda3 automatic but after shopping for almost 3 weeksand driving countless cars I found my Mazda3 | I love it it handles awesomely it is stylish clean the engine is sound the stereo system is fantastic for such a small sedan but it is not small inside | I can fit 4 average sized people comfortly | The only problem I see thus far is the dashboard is a very dark brown almost black and I live in Florida so it collects the heat and makes for a hot car until the air gets going full blast for a few minutes | I would defintely buy another Mazda | 
 "words": I've had the car about 8 months now | There are lots of features my car has for the money | Tilt telescoping steering wheel HID manual leveling lights auto wipers leather air bags all around the car | AC is powerful | Audio cruise control on the steering wheel is convenient | The 2 | 3 shifts up well and holds onto gears when needed though downshifts are a little abrupt at low speeds | Gas mileage is only decent and was expecting more but can't really complain considering acceleration and how I drive | Car handles extremely well at low and high speeds | Steering is sharp and impressive with very little float while the car stays composed over bumps | Brakes have good progressive feel |

 "words": I bought my Mazda3i sedan AT two months ago | It performs well I'm only sorry I didn't choose manual transmission as the engine is very lively and car itself is light so MT may give you better feeling of the car | But the AT performs smooth is very responsive and very comfortable to ride | Being 6'2 means many of the cars just won't give you enough space | Only question I may have is the fuel economy | I do 1 2 hwy 1 2 city with one passenger and after 2500 miles I got not more than 26 mpg | I thought it would be more savvy on gas consumption |
