 "words": I will never buy another VOLVO | This car has had the engine replaced new brakes roof squeaks and master computer went | The car in 2 years old and has ony 10000 miles The biggest waste of 49000 | Stay clear of this car
 "words": Bought our C70 through the Overseas Delivery Program | You get 2 round trip tickets to Europe anywhere anytime even peak season | a night at the best hotel in Gothenburg a free tank of gas worth about 170 | insurance while you are there a nice tour and lunch and of course the car is shipped back | We took the all night ferry to Kiel-a beautiful trip thru the fjords | Ask to book the ferry at the factory and you get a Volvo discount | We drove thru Germany France and Belgium then up to Amsterdam about 2000 mi | The car turned heads everywhere it gets good mileage and is a practical extravagance | Buy a portable nav with European maps in the US before you go- we didn't and wish we had
 "words": I wouldn't even consider buying a car without Sirius locking gas cap and good gas mileage | This car offers the above with the best audio quality of any car I've experienced | The 6 speed manual with use of 87 octane gets me 21mpg between by highway and city driving | I would probably get better mileage with the suggested 93 octane | That is decent considering the car is built solid and the engine is 2 | 5L turbo | My only 2 complaints is the driver's left side elbow rest is uncomfortable during long rides | Second I continue to experience small issues with the convertible top software | The car sometimes thinks the roof is open when it isn't so you have to open and close it to reset the sensors | 
 "words": I saw my C70 being built in June of 2006 in Udevalla Sweden and took overseas delivery of it in September | It is loaded with the nav system and the premium sound system | The car has been flawless in performance | The car continues to draw appreciative remarks from people especially when I put the top down or up | I still have the manufacturer's plates on the front of the car | Look forward to purchasing another Volvo in 2010 | 
 "words": Where do I begin | I have had 6 red cars and 4 different convertibles in the past 30 years | I wouldn't trade this one for all of them | Everywhere I go people ask me about it and compliment its appearance | It is fun to drive looks hot and I have had only a couple of minor service issues I am at 37000 now and the dealer bent over backwards to correct them | This is my 2nd C70 and they really improved it over the old rag top version | Its quiet doesnt leak in the rain and i have the top dowm most of the time | Buy one and go get a date | 
 "words": More fun in a Volvo than one could imagine | It is different too | Swedish cool that turns heads without being ostentatious | There are dozens of BMWs out there | So if you want something that does pretty much exactly the same thing but isn't me too go for the C70 | 
 "words": Got one of those 6000 imported C70 2007 babies and I'm really enjoying it | It is Magic Blue Pearl with white interior | Best most intuitive interior I have ever owned | I think it is called ergonomics | I also get people stopping me all the time to admire the car | Auto trans is a lagger at the light but acceptable for people who don't care to shift | There is a pull to the right during accelerated lane changes at higher speeds but again it is OK if you know it is part of the turbo right twist phenom | I took it to Yosemite and over 9000 feet mountain passes and the car was fantastic | Overall it is a great ride and a nice safe drive | Let's hope I can get parts as it ages |

 "words": This is my second Volvo C70 | I really enjoy the hardtop and the Dynaudio system | I have had to bring the car back to the dealer numerous times for the same two issues | The front windows were not going all the way up when the doors closed | It took five tries before they fixed this issue | The other issue is the full spare tire | Every time I hit a bump of any type in the road the tires rattles around in the trunk | Volvo has looked at this issue at least 5 times and still can't figure out a way to stop it | They are looking into a foam base for it to sit on | They believe it might be a recall issue down the road |

 "words": The four months that it took for my C70 to arrive from Sweden were well worth it | I've had the car for just over two months now and I absolutely love it | I have the manual 6-speed | It handles extremely well and is especially fun on curvy country roads | People stop and watch as the top goes up or down | Fuel economy is better than I expected | It's very comfortable the bucket seat supports your back and a long road trip is conducted with ease and comfort | And there is genuine room for 2 passengers in the rear seats | Adequate trunk space |
