REVIEWS
 "words": This car is awful | I feel so unsafe in this car plus it is so uncomfortable and I am very short | The car rattles and the mechanics can't find the problem | Gas mileage is not what they say it is | The tires that come with the car do not last | I would not recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": We drove 2 new Civic manual trans for 12 yrs each with no problems | As for the Fit Wire harness recall | Starter motor replaced at 34000 m | Broken front axle and manual trans | replaced at 39000 | We've lived in the same place since 1984 same driving conditions same avg | miles per yr | Fit's a relatively new model and its reliability hasn't really been tested until now | We'll soon know if the car's Fit to be called a Honda | 
 "words": When I test drove the Fit I listened for road noise cabin noise because I drive quite a bit | I should have driven the car longer | The cabin noise is simply overwhelming at times | I will consider other tires to see if this helps but the noise is so loud it makes the car feel cheap and tinny | Don't get me wrong I love this car I just can't stand the amount of road noise I hear | And my wife doesn't like the stereo playing at full blast in order to drown it out | 
 "words": I get 40 mpg on the hi-way | If it is cooler in the season and the a c doesn't need to be on that little car is great | It will drop down to about 37 mpg hi-way with the a c turned on | I'm planning on driving it up to NE Georiga next month so the truth will be known on the mpg then but It's great to fill it up on a meer 10 | 00 while others are laying out 20-50 dollar per fill up
 "words": After 3 years and 25k miles I haven't had to change a thing not even the windshield wiper rubber | It lives up to the Honda reputation | Ample room and flexible seat arrangements allows you to carry big or long items saving the cost of buying a truck | Its headroom is larger than most SUV and midsize cars | 
 "words": It's all wrong | The transmission setup is really awful | The gearing ratio into first gear and second result in a noticeable hesitation as the computer tries to match up with the short gear and the computer fuel delivery system | These tiny engine trans crammed into a tiny space don't leave much room for clutch travel | Whereby we have a short time to ease the clutch out and get moving | The feel is not really smooth at all and I have always enjoyed sticks | But in this car get the auto and spare yourself the grief | This car even chatters backing up a hill | I am sorry I bought mine it's very peppy and looks racy and cute but I can't get comfortable with the transmission | 
 "words": This car is fun to drive in good weather and gets great mileage but beware of driving it in the rain or snow | It just doesn't handle snow and ice like all the other Hondas that I've owned since 1974 | I actually had to have it towed once and the snow wasn't really that deep | Tires are expensive and hard to find | A big part of the money you save in gas goes towards maintenance and tires | I should have purchased a Civic | 
 "words": Has been 1 | 5 years and still running well | I like its practicality roomy interior and simple dash layout make it easy to control too simple that it looks a bit dull | Good engine performance for its class although the AC lacks it sometimes good maintenance would be to minimize it | Having much trouble with its huge front pillar making a blind spot when turning | 
 "words": I went from a Tundra to a Fit | The savings on gas alone is close to the monthly payment | Being able to fold the seats flat I have been able to fit everything that I have needed to | It is a surprisingly fun car to drive and I can fit the kids and enough stuff for a long weekend | Only complaint is a creaking sound from the dash | 
 "words": This car is not good if you are planning to have children you cant fit the stroller in the trunk with many grocery bags | The back seat is small and with the car seat you can only fit one adult | There is not much leg room for a tall man in the passenger seat your knees hit the dash board | Unless you live where the roads are paved smooth this car isn't for you if you go over a pebble it feels like you wrecked the car | I didn't know the tires didn't have locks and some low life robbed all my alloy wheels and tires cost 1000 | 
 "words": I have owned 5 Hondas over the last 10 years and may be a little bias But Honda has done it again | At first I was turned off by the small engine the kind of high price for its class | I decided to give it a chance and took one home for a test drive | Very impressed with power of little engine however dont buy if speed is your thing | I bought a manual and have had no problems getting where I need to be and getting on the highway works great for the most part | Very impressed with build quility | solid car with great gas mileage | If good gas mileage and quilty are your thing then this car is best in its class | Only had car 2 weeks will make another input after 3 months | 
 "words": This is a very fun car to drive | The acceleration is peppy and responsive | Handling is tight | The gas pedal is very loose even the lightest tap gives a response | A C is not very powerful but gets the job done | The sound system is excellent | Cargo room is amazing | Head room up front is fantastic there is no way I would hit my head getting in or out | The body is well put together nothing feels or looks flimsy | 
 "words": This is a great car period | Honda has done an excellent job of reinventing the hatchback concept for the new millenium | Two roadtrips ATL-DC and ATL-SC so far and no complaints | Car is fairly quick responsive and smooth reminds me of a BMW to drive except I'm getting 36 MPG at 80 MPH | In general I favor European cars BMWs Mercs VWs etc but Honda has done an excellent job of integrating an intelligently-designed vehicle great safety features innovative cargo handling excellent fuel economy with outstanding road feel handling and suspension | 
 "words": I've had some fun cars in my life including a couple of bimmers and a 911SC but this one takes the cake for pure fun | Like a horse on its way back to the stable this car seems to be happy doing whatever it does | I bought it for its practicality load capacity is great for a car with so small a footprint plus mid 30s fuel consumption so the fun is a bonus | One problem my wife loves it too so we have to split it's duty while the Passat wagon stays home | She wants to sell the Passat and maybe put another Fit on the driveway | I won't argue | 
 "words": The standard equipment mechanical safety and ride-handling characteristics rival the premium brands | Dual front dual side front-to-rear side curtain airbags ABS versatile seating arrangements MagicSeat and upscale interiors are wonderful even to the base Fit I have the Sport AT trim | Paddle shifters in my Fit are awesome too close to totally driving in manual without the stick-shifting and clutch | MP3 aux outlet is a nice bonus too | Buying the Fit is like buying years of fun safety security and total peace of mind | If you can stretch budget go for the Sport trim MT or AT | 
 "words": I was really not even going to look at the fit but my mechanic encouraged me to | Well I'm pleasantly suprised | It's got the fuel economy for my weekday commute and lots of space for my weekend dogwalks and camping trips | It's got more zip than you would think but it's not the Civic and it does get chucked around a bit in high winds | Bad thing is there aren't many of them so there are no real good deals to be hand | But at the price you really can't got wrong | 
 "words": Having owned my Fit for 6 months I do NOT and will NOT recommend it | IMHO Honda needs to start over | I have lots of issues with it | First is the Windshield wipers | WHY does that passenger wiper have to swing all the way into the drivers view | I feel this is a Safety Issue | However I guess Honda doesn't care | I could go on and on with all my gripes with the car | There are a few more that NEED to be mentioned | The Seats are not comfortable for long rides | The gas tank making annoying sloshing noises | For those that don't hear it I have to say HMMM | Are you DEAF | Rear license plate holder allowing the plate to rattle | The paddle shifers on the steering wheel boggles my mind WHY
 "words": Having owned an impressive list of performance cars I was not expecting much from the Fit in terms of performance but I was badly mistaken | This car is a blast | With a few aftermarket upgrades I madesuspension springs and lighter wheels this car handles as well if not better than a Mini | The lack of horsepower is just not missed when you have such a wonderful chassis to play with | Gas mileage has been 38mpg on average | Build quality is excellent | Paint is good | No rattles to be heard | If you are a car enthusiast forced to downgrade for a while this car is no downgrade | 
 "words": The car really feels much bigger than it really is | I was trying to drive it under 55 and it wasn't easy | The car responds and is very willing | 75 miles and the gas gauge has hardly moved | Should get better after break in | Took bumps very well | Didn't feel like the car was gonna shake apart | Got passed by some big rigs on route 80 on my way to upstate NY and the car held the road | I didn't feel small at all | 
 "words": The sport model with the larger wheels is so low you will hit concrete parking slabs and curbs | Since the front end slopes down it is impossible to see or judge just where the front end is | Also I am getting much lower mileage-averaging 27 mpg if I coast a lot and never tromp on gas pedal and I use A C at all times | The car is very nice looking with an exceptional interior and comfortable seats | The paint is very shiny but seems to scratch very easy or I didn't see the scratches when I bought it because it was sunny and car shiny | I wait to hit a pot hole or speed bump too fast and take off the sport attachment to the front bumper | Other than the above I really like the car and interior room | 
 "words": I've only put 1000 miles on my new Fit Sport manual but I must say I love it | It handles like a dream | Nice tight steering | The clutch and shifter throws are short and the acceleration is peppy | The stereo is loud and thumping and plays my my iPod tracks great through the auxiliary port | How many seating configurations does this thing have | There's room to tote my 6'4 self my girlfriend and our baby plus about a month's worth of groceries if we wanted to buy that much which we don't | Or it can haul a household appliance | What's that you say Mr | Salesman | delivery is extra | I think I'll pass | I traded down to this car from an Audi to save money and gas | No regrets | 
 "words": Each time I drive away in my Fit I feel I as though I'm privy to a best-kept secret | Who could want anything more than this li'l car offers | It has great pick-up on flat terrain and the most standard features in its price range not to mention the infamous Honda reliability | It holds a vast amount of cargo and the mileage is far superior to any SUV | Who needs to spend 10k more-for what | You can drive away with no guilt given that kind of savings and you're making a better choice for the environment to boot | This car is responsive fun to drive and feels solid | Call me Zippy and guilt-free |

 "words": Each time I drive away in my li'l Fit I feel as though I'm in on a well-kept wonderful secret | This tiny car delivers in every way | I researched a lot before purchasing and am so glad that I didn't spend 10k extra on the alternatives | No need | The interior is spacious with great flexibility | On level ground pick-up is good though not so hot on hilly terrain | Large windows are nice however interior heats up a LOT when parked | Cargo room is fantastic | This car is very zippy and loads of fun to drive | The price point makes it a real winner especially given Honda's great reliability and safety crash ratings | The Fit is guilt-free fun driving at its best |

 "words": This car is just everything I wanted in a vehicle a mini SUV-type that is practical yet fun to drive | It is unimaginably responsive | I was surprised that on the open interstate I easily took it over 90mph and not once did it feel out of control or blown about by larger trucks | In fact just about anything is larger than the Fit but you don't feel that way inside | I sit up so high that I feel that I am in a big vehicle and have to stop myself from taking on a Hummer | It is the tiny little thing with a big bad attitude |

 "words": Guys I'm very impressed | I was thinking to buy stay with it than give it back to get a Civic | Well after experience it | no more | I will stick with it for good | Absolute fabulous | Designed for the city but much better composed during trips | It even makes you feel you're going slower than what you're actuallly going | Here's why My family and I went to Tucson after the first hour on the trip I was pushing it a bit to TEST | going 100MPH at some stints then I was in shock when my wife asked me can you go faster than this thinking I was going 65MPH or so | The exact same perception I had | and why I was pushing it to check | Now that's composure | Try it |

 "words": I knew I wanted a hatch so I spied this in the latest car and driver | The FiT blew the competition out of the water | I checked it out and signed the same day | I love the handling | The suspension feels like something more likely to be on an acura and the electronic steering is amazingly precise | The sound system is great especially that big bright blue screen | The shifter is precise and the clutch is light | This car truly makes city driving fun | It could use a few things like a dome light armrest floormats and some more horesepower | But all of those things can be added so its not a major gripe |

 "words": Very sensible vehicle | Stick shift is very accurate my reference is Mazda3 2 | 3L 5-sp and well mated to the engine which has suprisingly enough torque to accelerate without frequent downshifting | Dash is well-laid everything visible and within reach | Seating position is too low w o height control and that does not let the driver take advantage of the large windshield and short hood visibility forward could be better | Cargo space and configurability is excellent would be outstanding even for a much larger car | Nice rims and right size tires for the car size and weight | Everything about this micro-van says practicality yet it is fun to drive too
 "words": I owned this car for 1 week and had to trade it in | This has to be the most uncomfortable seating position in history | I was either too far from the wheel or too close to it w no leg room | Drive it for more than the 15 minute test drive youll be glad you did | The seat is poorly designed as well | I'm amazed that Honda sells these things so well in Europe but I hear it has an adjustable seat height there | When fully loaded with friends the ride suffers and can be harsh over bumps | Buy a Civic instead |

 "words": I have researched this car since early March 2006 and I have found that the information that I have received from several sourices is correct | The fit is fun to drive and easy to drive | It has interior room then I thought and the safety features are second to none on a car this size | I am still breaking in the car but the gas mileage so far has been great | The interior room is more than enough | 
 "words": Its a great car and a lot of fun to drive | However I have a major problem with how Honda has marketing their Ipod Music Link | It leads you to believe that you can scroll through your music with ease from the audio controls | It does not offer a display instead there is a horribly annoying electronic voice that seldom works | I should have left well enough alone with the AV jack and not added this expensive and worthless feature | Save your money don't buy it |

 "words": The Fit is one sweeeeeet ride | Comfortable economical great shifter zippy performer handles well | Even though it is a four-year-old design it shows why Honda garners so many awards and loyal customers | I have heard it compared to the Chevy Daewoo Aveo in looks but The Fit is a much more integrated design and the interior is light years ahead of the Koreans | No other small hatchback urban runabout or wagon comes close to the Fit except perhaps the Scion xA | It is Storm Silver Metallic sort of an almost charcoal grey with black interior | The only major flaw is the lack of a sunroof option | Honda great job | I will surely take a close look at the next-gen Fit in a few years |

 "words": If you need a car that is going to give you excellent gas mileage is functional and surprisingly peppy this would be worth looking at | With folding seats in the front and back the entire inside seems to open up allowing one to transport large items with little difficulty | I purchased to extended warranty and feel good knowing that I have bumper to bumper protection for the first 120000 miles or 6 years | The only drawback thus far is how the vehicle manages bumps and pavement breakups | On those occasions the ride can be somewhat 'primitive' hold on to your fillings | Power locks windows and remote mirrors as standard accessories are nice touches | Overall for around 15 grand a terrific deal | 
 "words": Was about to sign the papers on a Civic EX Sedan and then spied this | A much better choice and tons more fun | It takes a little used getting to going from an F150 to this but I dont feel unsafe when trucks or SUVs gang up on me on the freeways | This has been out in Europe since 2001 so I wasn't afraid to buy its first year run in the United States |
