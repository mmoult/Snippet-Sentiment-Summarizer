REVIEWS
 "words": Pretty reliable no issues in 36k | Has good pep handles quite well is well laid out inside is roomy | Base seats are awful gas mileage is so-so and somewhat noisy inside but I'll take that as a trade off for a lighter more nimble car that does not need 200 hp to move
 "words": Lots of things broken or falling apart on this car after only tw and half years | Today we had to replace the ignition switch as it locked down on the key and wouldnt release it | To the tune of almost 400 bucks at the dealer | Their comment was This is a common problem on the Focus and Fusion' | Yeah FordFix Or Repair Daily |

 "words": When my old Tracer wagon died I couldn't find anything in my price range | In NYC at the time car dealers were selling foreign cars and luxury cars | My husband finally found a Ford dealer with a few Focuses on the lot | All I had to do was sit in the drivers seat and fell in love | It felt like my Tracer with controls easily accessible excellent comfort for my bad back and great fuel mileage for the rapdidly increasing fuel costs | Add to that the low cost and it beat out the Toyotas Mazda 3 and 6 and Honda Civic hands down | I would have considered it a bargain even without the 2500 rebate and excellent financing I was able to obtain | 
 "words": I love this car | The interior is a little plain compared to the Colbalt and stuff | But otherwise this has been a great car | It now has over 55000 miles on it and is still running strong | I haven't had to replace a thing on this car | Its great for me | I just can't stop talking about it |

 "words": We purchased this vehicle after owning a 2000 Focus LX | Our new coupe looked great in red with black cloth interior | We paid about 16k BUT were very impressed with the improvements made over the 2000 model | The interior quality is much improved as is the sound deadening ride handling and POWER | The DOHC 2 | 0L offers plenty of mid-range torque with an impressive intake growl | The brakes are good but lack anti-lock | The stock sound system is adequate | The vehicle handles VERY well for its class | it is difficult to lose grip even in the wet | Replaced alternator at 48000 miles 220 from AutoZone and a front marker lamp at 44000 miles | Overall we love the looks and performance |

 "words": After a trying three years of ownership with an 02 Focus I decided to give it another go with an 07 | I've had the car for a day so far | Performance is good comfort is good a very good value for the money | Long range reliability isn't promising so get an extended warranty that covers more than powertrain you won't regret it | My 02 was great until it 50k it was all downhill for the last 22k miles of ownership with that car | With the 07's the SE and SES are the best values if you want A C | 
 "words": Just got this car in the past few days as a replacement for another vehicle | I have found that this cars basic features are better than the same type cars in its class and I have no problems with this car so far | I did a great deal of research on this car and liked the MPG and the way it handles on the road | I have the added features of cruise control and side air bags that my last 2007 vehicle did not have plus that same gas savings even with the added horse power | Not as costly as a Toyota in the same class and is a better car than the 2007 Yaris that I had to replace | I would highly recommend this car for anyone looking for a fun way to get from here to there with good dependability | 
 "words": I drive highway to and from work every day about 80 miles round trip | I used to have a Cavalier that got 32 mpg and the Focus is only getting 29 | I wish I had my Cavalier with 100000 miles back | 
 "words": Well right after my first review the gas mileage took a nose dive down to the low 20's | Ford won't address this issue until 10000 miles | Still fun to drive though | I had a squeak too dealer said it was a something to do with the parking brake sleeve | 
 "words": We use the vehicle for daily transportation to work and routines | It handles well the options make the car look very nice and it has comfortable leg room for driving long distances | The dash board controls are well organized and easily accessible | Cup placements could be repositioned for easier access and use | 
 "words": Very good car for the price I got it for | Handles like a slot car and feels more than 151 horses good mileage too | 
 "words": 3 months 4500 miles so far | Mileage is 32 highway with cruise control at 75 mph 26 around town | Far better than my old Ranger but less than EPA unrealistic estimates | No mechanical troubles or noises | Plenty of room in rear seat for most people | Handles very well around corners much better than anything else I've owned | Pirelli P6 tires are quiet but track pavement grooves | Acceleration is good for this size car low end torque is also good | Go through the gears and be in 5th by 40 mph | Brakes good | I have the safety package with side seat airbags haven't been able to find seat covers that don't interfere with airbags | Sun visors are wimpy and look too cheap | Overall very pleased | 
 "words": The little ZX3 is not a Mazda 3 but it is its less expensive cousin with the almost same 2 | 0 engine less the vvt | Too bad that Ford is replacing the hatch back in 08 with a coupe but maybe it will drive just as well | I am getting 25 mpg in town and on a trip across California and Arizona on the interstate I got 30 mpg average on a 400 mile trip and my ZX is an automatic | I have only had it for a few months but they have been trouble free and Ford now has a 5 year 60K warranty just in case | It's a solid little car for the price | 
 "words": We have not had this car for but a few days but it is the neatest and best equipped car you can get for the money | We have a black SE sedan with the auto trans tilt telescoping wheel speed control and the sport group which includes the T-rated tires and multi-spoke alloy wheels and fog lamps tach and leather wrapped steering wheel | The anti-theft as standard is a delight | The car has the 50-state emissions 2 | 0L but the power is right where you need it on our two-lane hilly roads | It is a really nice handling and power combination for the 55-75 mph range | We stepped up from a Contour we've had two | It is a step up in every way and not much smaller of a car | 
 "words": This is probably the last affordable station wagon that provides what stations are supposed to space with a lot of fuel economy without paying for the performance of the car | My only complaint would be about the interior design where a few more compartments could be added and the quality of the materials could be higher | It would be great if all the accessories offered on the British version of this car were available | 
 "words": When gas prices looked like they wouldn't be headed below 3 per gallon last summer I started looking for a more fuel-efficient car to replace my Saturn VUE | In the past year I've had opportunities to drive several small cars Focus Civic Mazda3 and midsizers Fusion Mazda6 Accord G6 Maxima | In my book the Focus and Mazda3 were at the top of the list where driving dynamics are concerned | Since I'm 6'3 tall head and leg room are big considerations in a small car - and the Focus fit me better than any other in the class | Add to that the incentives on the Focus and the fact that I live in a state MI that's rather dependent on Ford's business success and the choice is made |

 "words": I purchased an '06 SE on July 29 and totaled the car on August 2 via a driver pulling out in front on me | The outside of my car was completely smashed starting on the front left | The inside remained almost unimpacted minus the airbag debris | While I could afford a higher ticket car I am completely confident and pleased with Ford's Focus | I purchased a '07 SES a month ago and am completely satisfied thus far | 
 "words": As far as driving goes it's kinda spunky | I'm getting over my loss on a nice '95 Mustang GT | But this little car has surprised me | It's a base model 5-speed | So far the only thing I'm complaining about is a slight engine tapping knocking | Which I'm still yet to get checked out | But overall she looks very promising for future modifications | 
 "words":  I own a 2006 Focus and previously owned a 2001 | I drive two 2005 Corollas as fleet cars at work and must say that I consider the Focuses better in absolutely every respect fit and finish handling interior design in every way | I do not know where automotive writers get their biases from |

 "words": I bought this car because it was all I could get financed for | It is fun to drive and not too hard on the eyes | The advertised gas mileage is complete horse puckey but I still average about 24 mpg | On long road trips I get about 31 | The rear shocks squeak loudly and the upgraded stereo sounds horrible | But all in all it handles like a little race car and the get up and go is nice | 
 "words": I leased this car because I was tired of using my Toyota Solara as a truck and I needed a vehicle for my many trips to Home Depot and did not feel the need for an SUV | I wanted something smaller that would serve my purposes | This Focus Hatchback has exceeded my expectations | It is fun to drive and the 4 cylinder Mazda engine is extremely quiet and it will haul you away from a stop that will leave other drivers wondering what's under the hood | I've carried a 6000 watt generator 13x13 rolled rug ladders power tools and more shrubs fertilizer and potting soil than I can count | The cargo area just swallows cargo |

 "words": With the ST 2 | 3 liter getting 26 m | p | g | city some hwy | Very good performance | I think interior is very good | Has lots of extras for comfort | Compared to my stolen Jeep Liberty it drives like a sports car | Stick shift is easy saves gasweight and mechanical complexity |

 "words": I've owned my little car only 2 weeks but it is a blast to drive so far | I traded in my 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck for something smaller with better gas mileage | I researched every car in the hatchback category and narrowed my choice to the Honda Fit Toyota Yaris and the Ford Focus | For the money the Focus was the best value for me | Yes the trade-in value will be lower than the others but for the years I will be driving it I have more features a great design and a reliable history | Plus Ford gave 2k in rebates that made the price perfect | 
 "words": I like the stick shift | The transmission is smooth and aids with fuel economy | The heater and AC are great and easy to control | The rear seats are a little cramped for big people but I rarely have anyone in the rear | I'll buy another Focus when this one has a lot more miles on it |

 "words": The exhaust on this car is loud | I wake my neighbors in the morning when I start it up | The seats are not comfortable | When sitting behind other cars at a stop light exhaust comes into the cabin even if the intake air conditioning is off | Don't buy this car | I guess that quality is no longer job one at Ford | 
 "words": It may seem silly but the removable cup holders ended up being quite the lifesaver | Fast turns and sharp braking always caused my coffee to spill over and now cleaning is a snap | Just take the cupholder out after work and pop it into the dishwasher | Awesome idea wonder why my other cars didn't have this feature | The major flaw I found is that the paint is scratched and chipped way too easily | New scratches seem to appear out nowhere everyday | Everything else on this car is solid and this car is definitely underpriced considering its build quality reliability and amusing driving experience | 
 "words": Good car overall interior is roomy but cup holders far away and cups tip over | Have always felt the car pulled to the right I'm a women so the excuse I get it's just the road | Steering is stiff to me | Pirelli tires not good only 21000 miles and already need replaced | Ford states tires have even wear but baldness not their problem |

 "words": Best mileage so far is 36 | 5 MPG | Five speed manual shifts easily | On open road car interior is very noisey road noise and is the only downside | Fit and finish was ok since hatch was not aligned very well from factory | Placement of the aux power receptacle is questionable since located very high on the dash | I use the car for basic commute averaging 75 miles per day | Unfortunate that Ford decided to discontinue the hatch | Smaller engine 1 | 5 liter and taller gears 2 thru 6 instead of 1 thru 5 would have made great mileage candidate | Advertised split rear seat refers to seat back only and not seat bottom so not truely a split seat configuration |
