 "words": My wife replaced her Sunfire GT with a new 2007 Escape Limited and this was her first new car she had ever purchased | We looked at a Mazda 3 and a G6 but she decided on the Escape | I don't care for SUV's but it did not take long for me to really start to like our Escape Limited | The fit and finish along with the quality of the interior pieces was very nice | The Escape is also very quiet and is even fun to drive on twisty roads | Most SUV's have terrible steering feel poor on-road dynamics and noisy tires | The Escape has none of those problems | My wife loves her Escape and I have learned to love it as well | It is the first SUV I have ever liked | 
 "words": When i was going to buy this car i did about a years research and money saving put a good down payment down for it | I knew exactly what i wanted color and everything i got the limited model and hooked it up | I put 18 chrome wheels on it with the toung skin grey exterior and the black leather interior changed the silver dash accents to silver burlwood blue led lights in side and out | The no temp gauge thing bothered me also so i installed a rear view mirror with it in it | Fold out indash recever 3 tv's with Two 12 inch JBL speakers in a custom box changed all the speakers to kenwood components and remote start | It really turns heads when im driving it and i get alot of compliments | 
 "words": I bought this 07 escape used with 40000 miles on it | I now have 46000 and i am loving it | I came from a ford fusion which got considerably better fuel economy however the added cargo space and go anywhere ability are well worth it | I get about 18mpg and i plan on getting a KN airfilter which i have been told by many vastly improves the fuel economy but increases some road noise | I love this vehicle and know that its been better then a Jeep i got around over my friends Jeep Wrangler with out a problem | 
 "words": I've been shopping for an Escape for a couple years now and finally made the plunge | I was going to buy the '07 new when I saw the re-designed '08 but it was too late to order one as I wanted a 4x4 with manual 5-speed | Found a clean '07 4x4 stick 17K miles and love it | Very comfortable excellent visibility | Mileage 23 27 and absolutely fun to drive | Handles great with lots of power for a 4cyl | The 2 | 3 has 25 years of refinement and it shows especially with the stick | Interior is basic but very functional | 
 "words": I run a fleet of Ford SUV's | I just bought numbers 14-15-16 of the Ford Escape in the last 6 yrs | I put about 100000 miles a yr on my cars run them 3 yrs before I trade them in | And the Escape performance and quality is 2nd to none | I also have 2 Ford Expeditions also very reliable vehicles however for the price differance fuel mileage differance I rather the Escape | Have very minimal amount of shop time on them considering the amount of miles I put on my vehicles | So most definitely 2 thumbs up | 
 "words": Did plenty of research here and elsewhere before I ended up getting my Escape | Great vehicle | Do yourself a favor get a KN air filter learn to feather the gas from stops and enjoy 23 MPG in the city with the V6 no less | I get 26-28 Hwy | Use the cruise control it's your fuel efficient friend | The Escape can be as much of a gas hog as you want it to be | The Audiophile System is awesome and a great perk | One of the best things I love about the Escape though is it's size | It's really nice to maneuver in tight spaces | I went from an F-150 to this so the maneuverability and double the MPG are greatly appreciated | My only real issue is there's no temp in the info center | Enjoy | 
 "words": I turned in my 2006 Explorer V6 XLT to get a smaller more fuel efficient SUV that was also not so truckish | The Escape V6 AWD was the SUV of choice | I got for a good price one year old used with 17000 miles | The Explorer I traded in got only an avg | of 12-13 mpg and had a real truck SUV feel to it | The Escape has a much smoother feel to it and gets an avg of 19 mpg | 
 "words": I bought my Escape a year ago | Was happy about it until problems started | First of there is a noise when I turn my stering which they told me that it was totally normal | Yeah right like it was built that way | Now the radio auto volume doesn't work | Change it 4 times and still the same problem so I gave up | Now a month ago the OD light started to flash and the transmission start slippering | Went to Ford dealer they check and change every sensor and still was the same | They didn't know what to do so they kept the car on their lot for a week before finally decided to open the transmission which it was broken inside | No technician to repair it | Had to order a new one
 "words": With a new baby on the way needed to trade our Silverado pickup for a more baby-friendly vehicle | Grew up with the Fords of the late 80's-early 90's and swore I wouldn't drive another Ford but now I own one I'm surprised at how much I like it | Opted for the 5-speed and can get up to 29 mpg on trips | The four cylinder is so quiet I sometimes can't hear the RPMs to know when to shift no idiot shift light to help | The engine is also very spirited that I fins myself speeding without knowing | I'm 6'5 and fit fine in back seat with front seat all the way back | Interior a little plastic-y but I like the look better than 2008 Escape | Though I've only had it for a month I like it | 
 "words": Gave up my loaded sienna with great trepidation | I'd become spoiled with all of the perks space and comfort but had to get awd and trade leasing for ownership due to a new job | Wish I'd done it sooner | Best decision ever comfort heated leather seats 6cd great cargo area smooth ride once the tire pressure was adjusted and awesome stereo | Couldn't ask for more | Even gets better gas mileage than my husband's kia sportage which has less cargo space no heated seats or 6 cd changer | Gets around great in bad weather | It's just fun to drive at a great price saved 150 mo on buying compared to my lease w out a trade | Had a Jeep and Blazer this is better |

 "words": Wrote previous review 1 month after buying now 1 year after purchase | Still love this vehicle | Motor broken in excellent off-line acceleration | Very comfortable on long 1000 mile trips | Absolutely no reliability issues w regular maintenance | So far unable to bottom it out yet over rough terrain ruts at intersections goes right over small obstacles like curbs if you go slow great for urban warfare | 
 "words": I've had my Escape for a year now and it has been an excellent vehicle | It's just the right size for a suburbanite like me | I can load 20 bags of mulch in the back with the back seats folded down or a 20 inch tv in the box but the car is still easy to drive and park | I am a low mileage driver but still I have not had one problem with the Escape | The ride is not as smooth as a sedan but on the one trip I took from Milwaukee to Minneapolis the ride was good | I've read elsewhere that the aceleration of Escape with automatic transmission was supposed to be sluggish but I find it to be vey quick and have had to ease up on the accelerator compared to other cars I've had |

 "words": The Escape appears to be reliable transportation | But not much else | Driving this used Escape from Enterprise I can see where Ford cuts corners to keep costs down | Plastic interior looks cheap | And it is | The sound actually echos around inside the hard-shell interior | Motor is weak | A C is strong | Very good A C | Wheelbase is too short for a vehicle this tall and this heavy | The car bounces and porposes down the road | It feels tippy | Would not give this car to an inexperienced driver | ie teenager | Poorly designed cargo area | There is a metal arm on each side which extends 7 or 8 into the cargo space when the seats are down | Rear seat forward tilt only | They do not fold flat | 
 "words": My wife traded her 2005 Focus in for this because we were having a baby and the car seat didn't fit well in the Focus | The car seat fits nicely in the back of the Escape | The Escape seems well designed for a family with a couple of kids | The AWD will be perfect for getting around in winter in Minnesota | The handeling is great | Gas mileage isn't the best in class | It's also missing some high end technology stuff and side curtain airbags found in the 07 Japanese alternatives | You have to pay more for that stuff though | We test drove a Saturn Vue and liked the Escape better | he Escape looks better than any other small SUV in my opinion | I am biased toward buying American

 "words": This is my 2nd Escape | The 04 XLT FWD was good reliable transportation with just a little dose of fun factor included | The LTD adds the MACH sound system which is much better than the standard unit as well as AWD which I can appreciate as a boat towing kind of guy | Using the old XLT FWD for towing my 3300lb boat was sometimes trouble coming out of the water | The AWD easily gets around any wheel slippage | Getting about 18mpg but drive it fairly hard and at least half the miles are city | Our family highly recommends this vehicle as a good fit between a CUV and any of its much larger politically incorrect cousins |
