REVIEWS
 "words": I agree with the guy who has the wind noise coming through the door seal or window seal | I have taken my Armada to the dealership more than a dozen times and they say the same thing they have no idea what it is | It is frustrating | I hear the wind more when it is cold outside or hitting a pretty good bump in the road | And he is right about the moon roof | Mine rattles and the dealership can't fix that either | Other than those issues I enjoy the truck | 
 "words": I've owned 2 Jeeps 4 Blazers a Bravo5 loaded Tahoes | This SUV is miles above these in performance Tahoes close | Tahoe interior is more comfortable pleasing | Rides like a sports car if one knows how to drive it | Staggering power readily avail | when needed | Handling amazing for such a large unit | Wonderfully controllable in all driving situations | Not ideal for average soccer moms but terrific for serious drivers w fun work and quality travel in mind | I own a Jag and a Mercedes sports car | When behind wheel of Armada I don't feel loss of control or power as one might expect after driving true sports cars | The difference in cornering is obvious but not uncomfortably or dangerously so | 
 "words": I love my Armada | I was rear ended by a Water Tanker Truck when I was stopped at a traffic light | And I wasn hit so hardthat I crashed into an Police car stopped in front of me | I found out from the police report that the tanker weighed over 33 thousand pounds | What a scare | ButI was barely scratched | I was not hospitalized and I was back to work the very next morning | I owe all of this to the fantastic design of the Armada | I WILL be an Armada owner from now on | Thanks Nissan | 
 "words": I love this suv | I've been a loyal Nissan owner for many years now but the armada has a couple issues | 1 | When you hit a bump while turning the wheel wants to over steer making the vehicle unstable momentarily | 2 | When it is windy and there is a slight cross wind over 20 mph the wind comes through the door seal opposite from where the wind is coming | dealer does not believe us no matter how many print outs of similar problems we bring in | This last trip we went on it was windy and raining and we had water dripping inside the cab | 3 | Sunroof vibrates from time to time | They can't find it | 4 | Interior plastic scratches way too easy 
 "words": Purchased my SUV over a year ago and just love it | Parent with teenagers always room for all the kids and bikes | No problems with anything and the Nissan service dept is excellent for regular maintenance | I recently purchase a small car another Nissan for gas purposes but refused to give up my Armada | 
 "words": I was incented to buy the Armada a year and a half ago because of its 1 class-leading legroom 2 my positive experience with Nissan SUVs in the past decade and 3 it is built in the US Mississippi | Have had no problems with it | The mileage is awful but I have a very small commute and don't put alot of miles on it so it's not a crusher | And we take a few driving family vacations a year that this is an absolute treat to travel in | Highly recommended | 
 "words": I wanted an suv that had plenty of room and was safe for my toddler son | After test driving my Armada I knew it was perfect | It is much more accessible than a Tahoe or Yukon | I read many reviews on here to see what everyone else had to say about the Armada and realized that gas was the biggest concern | Safety was my biggest issue so we went ahead and purchased it and are happy that it gets 17 miles to the gallon in the city | It is as big as a house we have room for days and the gas mileage is not much worse than a midsize | I am glad I chose an Armada | 
 "words": The comfort and ride are wonderful I pulled someone out of a snow bank 2 days after getting the truck and I have had to pull my parents Avalon out of the snow a couple times | Great owner websites out there to answer any questions or enlighten you to mods | Remember this is a truck not a hybrid | The V8 is SO smooth snd shifting is seemless | The ABLS and VDC system is incredible in the snow drive it during a storm and test it | I started looking in 04 for a new SUV I researched and drove everything except this one I rented one for a week and then bought one | 
 "words": This is my second 07 Armada | We had an accident with our first one we got t-boned by an RV | The Armada held up excellent even so it was later declared a total loss it got us 40 miles to the next town | It kept all of us safe even so the frame got damaged | After the loss we went and bought the same truck again | We also have a 9000 lbs trailer which we tow without any problems | I did not notice any of the brake problems a lot of people refer to | I stop that truck out of 60 mph with trailer safe and sound in a heartbeat | I love my Armada wish so they would provide a diesel engine as alternative | 
 "words": The Armada has all you need for an SUV when I purchased the truck I had to put it to the test so me and 4 of my buddys took a road trip to south beach miami | Needless to say 4 fully grown men fell asleep 20 min into the trip | They all said that that this truck was smooth and roomy and the bose sound system was really nice | They gave the truck tens all around | The only thing is this truck does eat gas so know that when you purchase this vehicle but all SUVs are gas guzzlers | 
 "words": The Armada is exceptional to say the least | I compared it to the Yukon Denali | After driving both it was a no-brainer | The Armada wins | I love the style the engine is very quiet and the Bose sound system is a plus as well | If you're looking for an SUV with a lot of bang for not a lot of money then this is a great buy | 
 "words": I traded my 2006 Pathfinder for this 2007 Armada LE | We need a car that can make our trip with two kids fun and ARMADA is more than what we expected | The car came with navigation sunroof and XM radio but no DVD and that is the only thing we had to add aftermarket which cost us 1500 | Nissan really did a superb job with this car | 
 "words": Wow this thing is a gas guzzler | What was I thinking when I purchased this thing | I always wanted an Armada so I bought one but with big regrets | Too many blind spots | I have a hard time seeing when I am trying to back out of a parking space | While this thing is very powerful the gas mileage is awful | I paid cash for mine | I am going to trade it in in about another month for something that gets better gas mileage | If you want good gas mileage this is not the vehicle for you | 
 "words": Test drove the Tahoe and liked it but once my wife and I got in the Armada we knew this was the choice | Lots of room inside and seemed to have a much tighter ride then the Tahoe | Love the power for towing | My wife thought it had less of a truck feel than other SUVs we tested | 
 "words": After going back and forth between the Armada and the new Tahoe we finally decided on the Armada | No regrets at all | Tons of power to tow a 6500 lb boat | I'm 6'5 tall | the Armada was way more roomy for me and for the rest of the family | My wife and I really liked the standard features too many to list over the competition | Best bang for the buck | Way to go Nissan | 
 "words": I bought this car after doing extensive research | After a lot of test drives and time I bought the armada | It is a great car | Plenty of room for all of my kids 3 with room for 3 friends in addition | I got a great deal on the car | If this gives you an idea of how smooth the ride is I drove 2 miles down a dirt road and had forgotten to get 2 screws off the bumper | After arriving at the destiniation they were still there | I love it the kids love it my husband loves it and people ask me what kind of car it is all of the time | it has been turning heads left and right | I will buy a Nissan again without a doubt | 
 "words": This is the second Armada I have purchased since 2005 | My overall experience has been very rewarding | The vehicle displays very satisfying levels of control and power | Acceleration is awesome for a vehicle of this size | Fit and finish is first rate | Interior noise level is acceptable | Very good sound system | Brake issues appear to have been resolved | 
 "words": I thought long and hard about buying my first truck suv that what not a gm product | I have no regrets at all | We took a short spring break trip and had a blast in the new Armada | I am very impressed with this vehicle so far | It is very quiet and smooth with a nice sound from the v8 | And it is responsive | My only regret is I wish I could have afforded the 4wd | 
 "words": Great truck | Only 2 complaints | Vanity mirror light not adjustable and cheap | 2nd thing is I have no light under the hood | 
 "words": this car is totally amazing | we just bought it and it is amazing it responds so quickly when you accelerate compared to the 06 Isuzu Ascender i traded in which is a GMC ENVOY LOOK-A-LIKE the armada's style is amazing | the visibility and for me a 6'4ft guy | it makes me feel small which never happens | also the chrome detail are amazing even though i got the base model the chrome makes it look so expensive which it was but it is worth every penny | nissan did an amazing job on it | everyone always stares at it | it makes me feel good | and the Bose sound system is amazing 
 "words": Good truck for the ladies to go to the store | Safe for even a lady to drive with your kids in it | yet good for a man to go to work in and make the cash 
 "words": After being a die-hard chevy owner for the past 22 years we decided to give the Nissan Armada a try we were also considering the Suburban and GMC Yukon | We needed to increase the traveling space provided by our '05 Silverado 3 4 ton Crew Cab while maintaining the ability to pull a 7k lbs horse trailer | When we viewed the Armada we were very impressed with the exterior design | We also liked the size as compared to a Suburban and the price of a fully-equipped Armada as compared to a Yukon Denali | It drives wonderfully has an impressive turn radius and is very spacious in the 2nd and 3rd row | 
 "words": Just purchased this vehicle last weekend | It is absolutely amazing | So powerful and fun to drive | Enormous interior that is well laid out | I could not believe how quiet it was compared to my 05 Pathfinder | This red SUV turns heads everywhere I go | 
 "words": The armada is fun to drive | No problems as of yet | The interior space of the armada is second to none | We have three boys and two large rottweilers plenty of space left over | We paid invoice minus rebate |
