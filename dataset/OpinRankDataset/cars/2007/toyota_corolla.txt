 "words": I have owned Toyota's for quite a long time | Love them | I do a 40 mile commute to work and it is really good on gas | Just have one problem | The rims look rusty | My dad's 87 Toyota pickup has better looking rims them mine | Don't know | Bought it brand new with 11 miles on it | Paying a lot of money and the rims shouldn't look like that | 
 "words": I bought my Toyota 2 years ago brand new from the dealership with 0 miles and I love it | This car is so cute and roomy on the inside | It drives great the AC is freezing cold and I really like the interior design | I got a special package of the CE that included cruise control power windows and locks and something else but I forgot what it is | lol | I love my car I just wish it didn't have those black things on the side of the door | I have a cute White one and the black things annoy me I'm trying to find out if I can get them replaced for white ones to match my exterior paint but have been unsuccessful | I love this car though | Awesome car | 
 "words": This a great economy car | I consistently get around 30 mpg on 50 50 highway city drive | The reliability has been excellent so far | The ride is where this vehicle is lacking a lot | Maybe the goal was to make the car with stiff suspension to look and handle more sporty | The result is rough ride with clearly pronounced and annoying bumps haystack wagon as somebody else called it | My other car is Huyndai Elantra and believe me the difference in ride quality is huge | 
 "words": This is a great car if you want a reliable car that gets great gas mileage this is it I do not understand why Toyota produced a later model Corolla that does not get as good as gas mileage as the earlier models | 
 "words": I bought the 07 CE model early this year | I commute 60 miles a day and needed something with good gas mileage | I love the plain Jane exterior it just seems to blend in seamlessly | The interior looks nice with the two tone gray and the cloth seats look better than average | The stereo sounds great and the controls are super user friendly | The air is cold and the heat is hot which is always a plus |

 "words": This is the first Toyota I have owned and it is an amazing car | My last 3 cars have been Pontiacs and this is by far the best | After reading reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase a Corolla I'm 6'4 and 230 lbs | I fit in the car just fine | The drivers seat is comfortable and I have no problems reaching the steering wheel although I do understand a need for a telescopic steering wheel | The car rides and drives great | I hope to get 250000 miles out of it or until the wheels fall off | Whatever comes first | I just sold a Firebird and the Corolla puts the bird to shame as far as handling and drive-ability | Go get one today don't wait | The gas mileage is great too highway city |

 "words": I bought this car the same week the 2007 was available | It drives well better than a Yaris | Its cheaper than a HONDA civic its cheaper than the ALTIMA | Think about it this way if you are in the market to buy a car that you need to use for your family and for traveling to work back and forth this thing is AMAZING | acceleration is good fuel economy is great if i had to give this car a grade on a scale of 1 10 it would be a 9 | 8 for sure | 
 "words": Thought I would buy a Honda Civic but dealers were not anxious to negotiate price- Toyota dealers were able and willing to hammer out the best price and I suggest working 3 dealers against each other | First full tank of gas produced 32MPG which is great- Speaker system 6 speakers is incredible | Great price- Great value
 "words": Good well built car with excellent gas milage and reliability | 
 "words": I love the way that it fits to my body | I sat in it at the dealership and I instantly fell in love | Samantha my saleswomanis young so she and I were able to relate about the sleek design and look that it has | The way that it handles the road makes me smile and it's ability to move so quickly are awsome |

 "words": Quite a good little performer | I find that the 1 | 8L 4 cyl engine outdoes the 2 | 4L of the competition that I drove | This car is not a dud at all | It can cruise down the highway smooth and quiet at 70mph or more | The LE has all the equipment you ever need | 30mpg around town is common | 40mpg or close to it at highway speeds | I hauled 4 adults one of them over 300 lbs from the airport without crowding or noticeable loss of power due to being heavily loaded | I like this car more every day and am happy it was my choice over competition |

 "words": Fun car to drive with great fuel economy | The S model has a nice sporty look without having to pay sport car prices | This is the first Toyota my wife and I have owned it is quieter and tighter than our previous Chevy and Ford sedans | 
 "words": This is my fifth Toyota product since 1992 and the only problem I've had was one blower fan which I bought from a used parts place for 50 and installed myself | I expect the reliability tradition to continue | The car cost more than Mazda 3 or Cobalt but I'm counting on savings on gas and resale value to cover the difference | 
 "words": This is my first Toyota | I drove the '07 Camry but I found the LE Corolla to be more my fit | I love the looks I love the economy and I love the price | You could get more with other vehicles but I bought this for the reliability and name | Not disappointed yet |

 "words": I drove my Corolla for a year with the impression that it had a big-car feel and a very smooth feel smoothest ever in fact | Then something broke and the dealership has been unable to fix it | Now I do not feel safe driving on the interstate because if I hit even a small bump and especially a series of small bumps it feels like I am going to loose control | At slower speeds it is just uncomfortable to drive on anything but the smoothest of roads | The dealership claimed to replace the front struts and maybe they did because it did seem to reduce the rough feel for a 1-2 days | 
 "words": I got a great deal on this little car more than a year ago and wanted to write a review | It's been a great for in town and it drives well on longer trips | Our two children fit easily in the back seat and the trunk has plenty of room for short trips | We have a manual and our average gas mileage is 32 mpg in town and 38 mpg on the hwy | I think it is the best bang for the buck when compared to other manufactures | My experience has been great with all Toyota products | 
 "words": I bought this car for my daily commute about 55kms one way | I bought the SE special edition so it came with a sunroof | I was a little annoyed it didn't come with cruise control | The car has plenty of pickup for merging onto the highway and bombing around the city | Gas mileage was a little less than promised but still good | I would agree that the steering wheel position is difficult for taller drivers | It can be difficult to grab the steering wheel while finding a comfortable location for you legs | Plenty of space for a commuter car and lots of trunk room | Almost two years later no mechanical issues and the price was right | 
 "words": We purchased this car as a downsize from an SUV because of gas mileage and gas prices | The Corolla has great gas mileage we average between 32 and 35 | Handles well and looks good | It is so small though | The door pockets are not large enough to put much in | There needs to be a trunk release on the keypad | It would also be nice if the direction and temperature indicator was on the rearview mirror instead of the dash | The front drivers seat can be raised | it would be nice if the passenger seat raised as well | The map lights on the rearview mirror are nice | The passenger can have it on tp read a map or whatever without it disturbing the driver | 
 "words": I have a 2007 Corolla S | One thing I like the most is the money I save on gas | Also I like the sporty design but they should add a remote trunk opener a little big horsepower and room in this S model | Other than that this car is great | 
 "words": This is my second car I bought a new one in Nov 2006 my first car was an old Mitsubishi Galant which I drove from 60K to 100K miles | Actual mileage city some freeway 25 mpg | The battery went dead at 6K miles after I didn't drive for 2 weeks | The car has a good ground clearance but when I drive on a windy freeway it feels like the car is going to be blown away | Not enough power entering a short or ascending freeway on-ramp | 
 "words": I bought a Toyota Corolla in January of 07 and have nothing but good to say about it | It is excellent on gas and very easy and comfortable to drive | I drive 17 miles each way to work and my Corolla saves me money on gas
 "words": I bought a brand new 2007 model in Nov 2006 paying a high premium | In a year I have come across these problems 1 One day the computer broke went out of order by itself and the car totally stopped | I had to get it towed to the dealer who fixed the necessary hardware codes taking 3-4 days | But if this would have happened during one of my journeys to Canada what would have been my fate | 2 The driver and front passenger seats are horribly uncomfortable | We feel as if we are sitting on a wooden bench without any cushion | In a drive of 30 minutes you would like to get off the seat because of the pain it gives | Also arm-rests are not provided | I am not at all happy with Toyota | 
 "words": Just bought this car for gas mileage | Went with the more stylish S | Bought the 5M to make it more interesting to drive | Not going to dazzle your socks off but is going to be a very able performer | Comfortable for the daily commute | Has enough creature comforts to stave off the want of a higher end vehicle | Love the gas mileage only having to fill up every two weeks | Toyota Loyalist | 
 "words": Driving by myself it has plenty of pick up to get thru traffic | Load it down with wife kids and luggage and it tends to slow it down to a craw | Great gas mileage 32 mpg adv | Great interior and exterior design | The radio isn't too good and the seats are not so soft | I need to take it to the dealership to because of the dashboard vibrates pretty loud | But with that said if you are looking for a basic dependable car that gets great gas mileage the Corolla is hard to beat for the price | 
 "words": Good car for gas mileage | Also sporty looking not to loose that with gas mileage | Not the power of a bigger engine but drives well highway or in town | Roomy enough for a larger person | 
 "words": I have had my car a little under a year and I love it | It handles real nice | Winter driving is ok if you drive smart | The best part is gas mileage | I get about 40 MPG | That's great with the gas prices up right now | 
 "words": Unquestionably the most practical reliable efficient gasoline passenger automobile with best resale period | The LE version has everything you need and nothing you don't | Street priced around 3K below sticker a name brand and very plentiful it has no meaningful competitor for basic safe and reliable transportation with lowest total cost of ownership | 
 "words": I have been happy with the S model | I am used to high comfort and performance so I was apprehensive about getting a small car like this | After test driving many cars this one was comfortable fun and had a good reputation | Also I like the great gas mileage | In almost two years I have had no problems and no complaints | 
 "words": Great overall car | Outside it looks very good | Not too sporty | Inside is very solid and has higher quality looking materals around the dash and steering wheel | Toyota plays it safe and didn't try too hard on its design inside and out | I own the blue one | All of the paint jobs are very nice | It drives and handles great unless you are in hilly country | Then it needs some extra pep | The seats have a nice adjustable recline that is very comfortable but could be a little softer | In fact the seats are very hard and don't break in | 
 "words": Being retired we tried getting along with one car for a year but living in a rural area it just didn't work | After much research we decided on the Corolla CE as best suited for our second car needs | Now after 9 months of of trouble free ownership it's rapidly taking primary car status away from our '05 Pacifica | The little car is pleasing to drive and feels bigger than it is | Our fuel mileage is consistenly higher than that posted on the window sticker | 
 "words": I have had this car for 9 months and it is great on gas | I have not had any problems with it at all and it is brand new so I would hope not and it is easy to get around in | For the price it is a great value and quality is excellent | 
 "words": We bought this car in January so we could have a nice little economy car to drive around | I had a lot of driving to do over the summer and our other vehicle is a Dodge Ram Quad Cab | It is one of my most favorite cars I have ever driven | It has surprised me more than once with its handling and efficiency | A great car if you do a lot of driving and spend many hours in your car | I like the manual shift I get greater control and that is something this car in an automatic model would not produce on its own | The standard shift also gives me more MPG on the highway and in the city | I average about 38 mpg to 42 mpg on the highway | It has 15000 miles on it now so as you can see I love it | 
 "words": I love this car | The gas mileage is great and it has decent power for a compact car | I recently got in an accident with this car and it held up great no injuries | When we buy another car it will be another Corolla | 
 "words": Picked up this car 5 2007 and now have 1200 miles on it | Vehicle came equipped with Goodyear Integrity P185 16 which have an air loss problem | Letters to Toyota USA Goodyear unsuccessful forget the dealer bad news with them | Even though Toyota chose to put these tires on their car they blame Goodyear Goodyear is unresponsive | According to the National Highway Traffic Safety website there are 25 complaints filed on these tires so something is wrong | Overall for this car Toyota has failed with it the interior is sloppy the vehicle handles like it is 4 yrs old not 4 months old | Also once I tilt the wheel I cannot see the speedometer
 "words": Nice cheap little car | Lacks performance with a 126 HP engine especially with 3 passengers on board and the AC cranking the thing will barely accelerate under all that stress | At higher speeds at about above 75 mph it becomes a little unstable to drive on the highway it feels like you could lose control of it because of the wind and drag | I think the car might be too light | I also don't get the advertised mileage | But on the upside it still runs | I guess that is all that is asked for by any Corolla owners and nothing more | 
 "words": I owned this car for 15 months then it was totaled in a head-on collision | I had it for approximately 15000 miles | The car specifically the seat belt air bad and design saved my life | The entire front end crumpled and both the appraiser and tow truck driver said it was the worst they had seen in months | I walked away from the crash with a few bruises | I highly recommend this car just for its safety | Great gas mileage | 
 "words": This is a car with all the same things as a normal car but great fuel efficiency | 
 "words": I drive the S so it has a sportier look but nothing sportier under the hood | I don't like that this model is larger than previous generations | At times my compact parks like a small bus | OK gas mileage though I admit my mileage is 90 city averaging around 27-30 mpg 34-37 when I do drive highway | 
 "words": I bought this car 10 months ago and it still feels like a new car | Being a new car it is hard to say how reliable it is but it has not failed me yet | The gas is wonderful and lasts a long time though like any other car the A C drains the gas very fast | I will say that this is not a sports car | Don | t expect to go 0-60 in 2 seconds | It is mainly for looks not speed | I use it just to take me to work and really nothing more | I highly recommend this car if you want a low price car and great gas mileage | Just wish the A C was stronger | 
 "words": Today I have owned my new 07 Corolla LE exactly 3 months | I have over 11K miles on it 80 20 highway city at around 73-75 mph highway | I drive with a light touch and I am getting 34 | 9 mpg | I anticipated closer to 38 | We got this car for economy and reliability | I think the mpg will improve as the car wears in | Handling is ok acceleration is ok and road noise is ok | It | s an econo-box not a sports car | We are happy with the car it has met our expectations | I like the traditional body style |

 "words": For an economy car it has ample room for a normal sized person | I like the pep the car has and it can zip around with ease | Nice body styling with very easy to use dash panel controls | The interior does not appear cheap like some of the other economy cars | Smooth ride on good surface but you feel it when the road gets bumpy | 
 "words": We bought this car for our daughter to learn on and for us to use later at a retirement home in Arizona | Wanted something dependable safe and easy | Good price but not especially sporty | Our daughter thought it was cute and loves it | We love the gas mileage at 38 hwy on first tank | 
 "words": Initially I loved the car | Into 1-2 months the car was taken in for various concerns mostly brakes then later in the months for check engine light rattling | The dealership supposedly resolved the issues | Why was it necessary to go back on many occasions especially for the brake work | And why did the check engine light come on this was not filling up the gas tank related | I am now questioning the reliability of the car | All I want is a good car with good gas mileage and looks good | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Corolla | My first one was purchased in 1990 and it was still running strong but I decided it was time for a new body style | I love it | It runs so smooth drives awesome good gas mileage | I recommend this car to anyone who likes good deals and cars that will last forever | 
 "words": Considering that I'm in my car all day I must say that the Corolla is a very practical everyday car but boring nonetheless | I don't really get excited when I'm in it and I don't look at it beautifully like I did my previous car | Maybe it's because I upgraded from a 1996 Civic but this Corolla had so much potential to be a fun everyday vehicle | Hopefully the next generation will be better | 
 "words": Have owned an 01 Avalon 02 Camry and 06 Avalon w highest regard for my purchases and vehicle performances | Purchased 07 Corolla 3 weeks ago | The Corolla fits into the same value and performance as those Toyos of previous | Clearly not a sports car | Clearly not the most vivacious exterior | Clearly not my 06 Avalon | However this vehicle matches my travel needs extremely well | My auto tran is delivering 36 mpg with a quiet and smooth ride | I drive 700 miles per week for business and this vehicle exceeds expectations for travel and value | I highly recommend the 07 Corolla to anyone in need of a driving machine that delivers and keeps you driving vs | in service shops | 
 "words": I'm pleasantly surprised at the excellent performance handling and relative quietness of the Corolla | I came to this car after running a 1990 Ford Probe 5 speed GL into the ground | The Probe would easily beat the Corolla off the line but highway performance and handing on curvy roads are the same | Corolla stick shifting is smoother | Tire noise is quieter than Probe but still noticeable | Engine is quieter and smoother | Fuel economy is currently running 37 mpg highway and suburban driving | Over the first winter 34 mpg was typical | I only hope Corolla reliability lives up to the reputation | 
 "words": Well if you get down to it the Corolla is the highest purchased vehicle in the world due to popular demand | 42 MPG affordable dependable sporty and talk about resale | I drive a Tahoe that I love and we needed a vehicle for my wife and looking at reviews on this car it is the highest rated and most purchased | There are a lot of other vehicles out there cheaper but when I buy a vehicle I would like it to hold its value so when I trade it in I can get what it's worth | Anyone looking to purchase a car need to purchase the Corolla or the Camry | 
 "words": I just bought my Corolla and this car is EXCELLENT | Peppy fun handles extremely well | I feel I've got a top quality car | Can't wait to see the gas mileage after my first fill-up | Compared to other models in its class this car is still top notch and sets the standard | I urge everyone to test drive one then buy it | 
 "words": I drive 400 miles a week and needed a car that was more economical with these increasing gas rates I was spending over 450 a month on gas alone | It was time for a change even if it ended with a small payment for some time | The first thing I did was an internet search autos with high gas mileage 35 miles per gallon and cheap | Guess what popped up on every web site and forum Yes Corolla | So my only option at this point was to buy one | Yes now I made the correct choice | I used to fill my tank 3 times a week | Now I only need to fill up once a week | That is a money saver | Thank you Toyota for making my life more reliable and practical | 
 "words": LE w moonroof auto | Does everything well | Good if sometimes busy ride | Firm seats comfortable for long trips | Headroom fine for my 75 under sunroof | Fairly quiet ride | Good sound system | Roomy trunk | Outstanding economy 30-35 mpg | Driving postition is a bit odd when hands are at 10 and 2 on wheel | It's fine for the 4 and 8 o'clock position the pros recommend | Only gripe is that useful options e | g | alloys stability abs hard to find | Distributors prefer packing the car with pricey junk like paint sealant stripes etc | 
 "words": This is a nice little car | Looks bigger than other cars in its class | Has a pretty big trunk and is spacious under the hood | Did the first oil change and it was a breeze | Filter and drain plug are next to each other | My only complaint is the actual MPG I am getting is 30 | 5-32 | 5 hwy | Not quite the 39 hwy like Toyota advertises but still good | Great overall car I am 6'3 and have adequate space nice sound system with the 6 speaker 6 cd changer | I would recommend this to anyone looking for an economical and reliable 4dr compact car | 
 "words": The Corolla has moved into the sweet spot in the American car scene that the Camry held for years | The car is as big as a 96 Camry inside and will meet most drivers' needs as well | The Camry has become more car than most of us need now | Gas prices have many Americans looking for a new sweetheart | Corolla is much more refined than before | The ride is smooth and quiet and there is plenty of power | The fabrics are even Camrylike soft yet durable | Everything seems to be right where you would have put it yourself | Just the right car at the right time | 
 "words": I replaced my 2000 Pontiac Bonneville with a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE 5 spd | The only reason we went with a small car was because of the cost of gas otherwise we would have never done it | The 2007 Corolla is horribly uncomfortable to drive | There is no support under the front part of your thighs and the steering wheel is too far away | It seems impossible to adjust the seat to get into a comfortable driving posting where you can actually grab the steering wheel at 10 and 2 | My wife owned an '89 Toyota Corolla and it seems like it has changed little since then except gotten more uncomfortable | 
 "words": I bought my 5 spd corolla in sept '06 and have put on almost 21000 mi already | I drive 80 hwy and avg 41 mpg | Awesome | I have had ZERO problems with this car so far | The 5 spd shifts great and has enough pickup for my needs | A sports car it is not but for anyone who doesn't need race track thrills this is simply the best car available | Awesome gas mileage bulletproof reliability and it even looks nice | Also for those of you who work on their cars there is loads of room under the hood so working on the engine and other components is not a cramped nightmare | 
 "words": This is a great car to own and drive | My wife and I drive it to work every day in heavy traffic and the Corolla makes it easy to handle | The gas mileage is incredible averaged 41 mpg on a trip from DC to Florida and routinely get 33-34 mpg driving in heavy city traffic | It looks great and rides well | Negatives The seats are well made and high quality however they can be a little uncomfortable after an hour or so I've found | 
 "words": I LOVE my car | It drives super nice and so smooth | However there are a couple things that I'm not necessarily fond of the radio seems like it's on the other side of the car lol and I think the back seat is a little small | But other than that I really don't have anything bad to say about this car | It's super cute and I love it | D
 "words": I tried not to like this car but every time I compared it to something American made there was no comparison | The S model makes the car look much nicer in my opinion | I have almost 4000 miles on it since March | Gas mileage is excellent | Consistently getting 34-35 mpg with 75 highway driving | I'm 6'-2 and am pretty comfortable in it | I use a wheelchair and it fits in the trunk fine | The seating position makes you feel like you are sitting in a larger car | I agree with many other reviewers that the steering wheel position is a bit awkward but I have quickly gotten used to it | I would highly recommend this car to someone needing economical reliable transportation | 
 "words": Fun to drive | Get the protection package to prevent unwanted rattles and noises it protects your paint too | The sports package gives it a great look | This car is perfect for all age groups | I read a lot of reviews before purchasing and noticed a lot of people said the seating was uncomfortable | I have not had that problem my previous vehicle was a 4Runner so that's really all I can compare it to but I find it comfy | The car looks so small from the outside that it's hard to believe how much space is inside | I love it | 
 "words": At 6500 miles we've had a rear trim weather strip seal fall off | Gas mpg not what sticker called for 31 city 38 hwy although not bad we're getting about 34 on the hwy and 27 in the city | Transmission shifts good although it switches between gears a lot on the hwy usually downshifting going up hills and mountains | This is probably due to a low torque horsepower engine | 
 "words": Just bought a month ago with ABS and side airbag options | Couldn't find one at dealers with ESC | Great car so far approx | 30 mpg combined thus far | Very quiet good backseat and trunk room | Considered a hybrid prius or civic but went with the Corolla for the price | Only negative is the drivers seat position related to the radio and steering wheel | 
 "words": This is a lot more car than I expected | Great fuel economy reasonable price solid Toyota quality and dependability | 
 "words": I bought the car about a month ago | It seems like I might be having a problem with it | It seems to hesitate alittle when starting out | Doesn't all the time though | I like that it has a lot of room inside | A lot of trunk room too | Not too good of handling on the highway speeds | I would say about 70 mph | 
 "words": I just got my car yesterday | It is fun to drive | I fit perfectly at 5'1 my husband is 6'3 he is a snug fit driver but he felt it would work | The back seat is roomy and lots of head room | It handles well with good acceleration though the pedal is a bit touchy | We would have liked to get the back seat air bags but could not find them | Car sets higher than my chevy car-lumina so it is easy to get in and out of | Overall good smaller car | 
 "words": The Corolla like all Toyotas has been built with precision to be reliable and practical | I got the S model so I could look good at the same time | The car is fairly fun to drive too thanks to a smooth and peppey engine and a precise 5 spd manual | I was looking at a Mazda 3 which I still think is more fun and better looking but the price was right on the Toyota probably because they're revamping this model for 2008with 0 | 9 interest and 750 cash back on a lease | It's built for smaller drivers I'm 6' as evidenced by the steering wheel being close to the dash and high seat height | After about a week I found an acceptable driving position but still no thigh support | 
 "words": I have been pleasantly surprised with the comfort of this car | The drivers' seat curves nicely around me to provide support for my back | I haven't had it long enough to know just what sort of mileage I get yet but I'm impressed so far I've gone about 100 miles and only used 1 4 tank | In my other car which I traded in I would have used 1 2 tank by that time |
