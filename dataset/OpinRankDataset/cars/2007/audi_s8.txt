REVIEWS
 "words": This is the most outstanding car I've ever driven | I also own a Mercedes SL600 with a Kleemann power upgrade and in the morning I find myself reaching for the S8 keys | This car is a very fast sedan but what I really love about it besides the all wheel drive for Wisconsin winters is that it is so comfortable to drive and that the dash layout is so simple and intuitive | This is the first sedan that I have ever found to be exciting to drive | The paddle shifters are way cool | 
 "words": I traded my 997 to to get what I perceived to be a peaceful luxury car that delivers a violent soulful motor on command | I couldn't be happier | No more annoying tire noise competing with the sometimes flatuent contrived exhaust note | Instead I get full luxury including double-paned windows and felt lined wheel-wells to ensure tranquility punctuated by refined violence upon driver demand | I also get an ipod interface and bluetooth | When I miss my 997 I can always take out my 87 911 for a visceral run | And when I really require a jolt my F355 delivers without fail | The S8 is always the car I reach for first | that says a lot | 
 "words": I bought my S8 because I believed it would be a fun-to-drive relatively light weight fast sedan | It has ponderous handling shifts erratically and is full of insanely complicated useless electronics | The suspension lowers itself after parking so that the car has to be parked rear-end-first so the front doesn't hang up on the curb | I tried to give it back the 2nd day I had it but Audi refused as S8s are special order | 
 "words": I wanted a car that was good in the snow but also had good performance this fits the bill | 
 "words": The is such a great car | I bought an S550 4matic for myself but there just wasn't enough power there for me | I saw the S8 drive by and my son who is 13 and knows a lot about cars told me I had to check it out | So we drove right to the Audi dealership and ordered it | I have since given my wife the S550 and she wants to have my car | I really enjoy this car and it is powerful and has the fourwheel drive | We live right outside of Philly and we do get snow so that four wheel drive is great to have | It you can buy it I would definitely recommend doing so | 
 "words": The S8 is the German automobile perfected | Flawless engine superior ride and handling classic styling and the absolute best interior available at any price point | Compared to the Jaguar XJ8 much more refined | Compared to the BMW 750 760 better in almost every way ergonomically | Also far superior interior | Compared to the Mercedes S550 again the interior is more luxurious and the engine blows the S550 away | 
 "words": I decided that maybe Audi had just created the perfect luxury car | After 3k miles I believe they have | It is perfectly silent when you want it to be | Want to be sporty | One or two down shifts and a tap of the right foot and you know you are in the right car | The electronics are well thought out too | Handling stuns | The throttle is not too sensitive | No problem did they fix it | Looks | Subjective yes but it makes a very discrete statement | I am very happy my S8 | And I don't miss my 997 a bit | 
 "words": I traded in a BMW 645 Cabriolet for the S8 and at the time was worried that I might miss the BMW | After 4 days of driving the S8 I can honestly say that I made the right move | And I moved up in a big way | 
 "words": I have owned and driven all cars from S500 to Porsche to BMW to Maserati to Ferrari | This is by far the best car I have owned and driven | It is a car which one can drive hard or soft | The full option version is one to go for which is with the Bang and Olufsen stereo this is a must it really improves a sound quality | 
 "words": As with the few other owners I debated the choices | When it came right down to it making the selection for an S8 was more about uniqueness performance comfort and subtlety | What I didn't expect when making the decision and to my great surprise since it is almost impossible to test drive them prior to purchase was 1 how great it handles drives and performs 2 how modern the electronics are iPod and satellite and telephone integration | systems and suspension control 3 how comfortable it is AND how much fun it is to drive and 4 that it keeps getting better | I find the power band perfectly tweaked for a luxury sedan great performance as an automatic amazing performance as a manual tiptronic | 
 "words": It's an awesome car | Had it for about 2 months now and yet every time I turn the engine on I can't help but grin like a 12 year old in a candy store | Having had various luxury cars over the last several years I can honestly say that I've never seen a more complete package it's an absolute joy to drive | Even though it's relatively similar to the A8 it turns heads everywhere | I often sit in heavy traffic and let me tell you people especially other drivers stare | The only problem that some people might have is that it can get quite uncomfortable when you have several pairs of eyes glued to you for extended periods of time while you wait for the lights to change | 
 "words": Drive this car on Highway 1 from Carmel to San Simeon and you will be hooked for life | Better by far than my SL 500 | Handling acceleration and the paddles pure fun truly wow | 
 "words": My decision was between a Mercedes S550 4 matic sport and the Audi S8 | The S550 is nice but the S8 just felt like something more special | The v10 engine smooth and quiet at normal speeds and unbelievably poweful and baritone when you want it to be and the special S interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm | Even the ride with the std 20 inch rims is wonderful in comfort mode | unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country | I average about 15 | 5 mpg 70 city 30 highway | Not great but hey that v10 power noise has got to come from somewhere | Net no regrets so far | 
 "words": This car is truly a joy to drive | I have a Maserati as well as an Aston Martin | however every morning when I wake up and grap my keys | I find myself continually grabbing the Audi Keys |
