REVIEWS
 "words": Our sienna is a well designed minivan and I am very happy with the 3 | 5 liter V6 and 266HP | And the 3rd seat is easy to stow and useful | 
 "words": This is our second Sienna | our 1998 was fine | We've had the 2007 model for two years now and it's had a lot of trouble with the run-flat tires | A couple of flats and the air-pressure warning light comes on way too often | Today I took another flat to the dealer | the service department said you're not supposed to just replace one of these at a time we should do all four | Otherwise if the differential fails or the transmission fails Toyota won't cover it under warranty | So throw away 3 good tires only half worn and spend 1000 on new run-flats or Toyota won't honor the warranty | Ridiculous | Also this van gets at least 20 worse mileage than our old one | Disappointing | 
 "words": I was told to choose Sienna or Odyssey | My mistake | At this rate I probably wouldn't pick either | We're very disappointed with this car | Under the hood yes it's ok | It's the small stuff that's frustrating | It seems like there is always another minor issue | Of course some really are just minor ie the window trim comes off but still annoying | We paid too much for these issues | The stuff that really bothers me is things like the very loud rattling on the right side sliding door | taken in | no one can find anything wrong I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone | There must be something decent out there other than the Sienna or Odyssey | Off to the auto show -
 "words": I love this van | I do a lot of driving almost 700 miles a week simply routine not including other out of town trips | This mini van is one the the best and reliable vehicles I have had the other being a Toyota as well a Tercel back in the 90s | It's comfortable rides smooth and looks great too | The only annoyance has been the tire sensor light when the weather gets cold outside the sliding doors don't latch open when windows are down | But small potatoes compared to other vehicles I have had | I have had this van for 16 months and have 40000 miles already | No problems from this vehicle nothing negative in my eyes about it | I love it and would definitely buy another without pause | 
 "words": The acceleration on this van will knock your hat off | The ride is very smooth and quiet | Fun to drive | Fuel economy is good 20 city 23 hwy | Cavernous space inside fits our family of 7 and all our stuff easily | For hauling it fits a full size couch if you take out the middle row of seats out | It's a trick to learn to take them out but not bad once you do it a few times | The big nose is a major bug magnet | The only issue we've had is tire pressure sensor error | Wife has drained the battery three times by leaving lights on | but it fully recharges and works like new | Overall we're highly satisfied and would purchase again | 
 "words": I reluctantly entered the mini-van world last year | I thought that my life had lost all meaning | However the Toyota quickly restored my faith | I have always had Hondas and Toyotas and the Sienna is by far the nicest riding vehicle that I have ever owned | Most comforting given this difficult transition from car to van was that the Sienna is also the fastest minivan on the planet by a long shot 0-60 mph in a little over 7 seconds is not too shabby-leave Honda and Nissan owners in the dust | Surprisingly good fuel economy for a vehicle this size 25mpg average | Toyota build quality is the best | Only service problem we have had was that the digital clock | 
 "words": Very pleased with mileage on highway | Handles well and has a short turning radius | Seats are difficult to remove and replace | Power window on driver side is hard to regulate | 
 "words": We narrowed our search for a good big family car down to the Toyota Sienna XLE or the Honda Odyssey equivalent level | We bought the Toyota and in the first 6 months had to have the CD changer replaced 3 times | One tire won't hold air steadily the paint chips very easy the key transmitter needs replaced and no matter how and where we drive we can't average better than 18 mpg | Our dealer takes care of the problems under the warranty but we loose much time having to go there and wait for repairs on a new car | Our conclusion is the building quality for the price does not match and we are now considering trading in for a Honda Odyssey | 
 "words": Nearing one year with 2007 Sienna 18k miles | Great room for kids and all that comes with them | Drives nice with lots of power | Handling not so great breaking a bit scary at times due to the soft break pedal | Interior quality is not so Toyota-like | needs refinement with attention to materials and finish | A C needs more power to the back seats | I would like to say the gas mileage is better then I thought | We're getting around 22-23 MPG combined and the added power is nice to have during traffic in outs | 
 "words": Love the Sienna Minivan but Toyota's fit and finish stinks | Three days after buying the minivan the 6 disc cd changer failed had to wait a month for a new one | Next was the front driver and passenger door panels get stuck on the door sill and pop off | The rear power outlet fell out of the side panel and does not reset in the hole | None of the dash board pieces fit evenly too many big gaps | Last is the Michelin tires seem to wear fast but that might be due to wheel spin | 
 "words": Had the van 6 months and had to be in the shop every other month | First the battery died and I had to drag the van out of the garage with 5k miles | Then the tire sensor had to be replaced check engine light comes on electric motors jumpy rear latch broke and the door wouldn't even open | All this with 10k miles | I bought a new vehicle so my wife works nights and small children would have a reliable vehicle and I wouldn't have to worry | Now I have to spend a Saturday taking it to the shop | Can't get rid of it because the dealer says I still owe more than it is worth | Can't wait to see what happens next | 
 "words": First year my battery died off first year had a new transmission to my XLE limited edition | Year and a half had a new ac compressor | Third year starting to have problems with my transmission again | I bought the vehicle brand new | I just can not believe this | I think very highly about Toyotas there quality is the best | I just got a bad one unfortunately | 
 "words": Many many problems with the interior of the car | Middle passenger side seat is a lemon seat seat belt is major issue 5th time trying to resolve | A C system airflow distribution disproportionate in the bi-level and floor level settings | Rear air conditioner and heat appear to not be cooling and barely heating | Radio defective speaker blown 2x tire pressure sensor broken side mirror control fell into dash base of lemon seat cracked handle of same seat broke over head light broke over this seat rear bumper came loose tires are bald at 25K milesair bag indicator light malfuntioning | I cannot believe the problems we're having | 
 "words": This is the best minivan I have have ever driven hands down | The power is unreal | We found this Limited to handle like a sports car | It corners very well | It is not tipsy feeling like the older Caravan or even an 08 Uplander | We are very happy with our purchase | 
 "words": The van drives nicely handles great | It is a tank in the snow and ice which is mainly why we went for it as there are no AWD models from other manufacturers | That display showing 15mpg though is a real downer | 
 "words": Bought the Sienna XLE Pkg 6 nav DVD etc in May | Have 9 | 5K on it now | Took 3000 mile road trip in September | Very comfortable | Mileage averaging 18 mpg | Not one problem | New 3 | 5L V6 is great | The Sienna's not as cool as the Odyssey and is a bit boring to look at but it's reliable comfortable quick and my wife is happy after all what else really matters | 
 "words": I got this vehicle because I needed something that was more family friendly than the 04 Tacoma standard cab that I traded in | I didn't want to take a hit in gas mileage so this minivan ended up being the best choice compared to SUVs etc | that could still haul things | With an EPA rating of 26 hwy I expected to get somewhat less but I have been extremely pleased with the Sienna | With my mixed commute driving about 100 miles day RT I average 28-29 MPG | Way beyond expectations | I am a conservative driver but I do the speed limit | Flat out highway only driving I actually get in the low 30s at 65-70 MPH according to the mileage display | And it will hold more than the Tacoma did | 
 "words": If you have to move people cargo or even your pet goldfish why would anyone buy anything but a minivan | SUVs play to the ego but minivans play to the practicality | I use my minivans for business and have found nothing better to move equipment and people | I've also owned many kinds of minivans and until now thought they were pretty much all the same | But not this time | Toyota tops them all | It drives with incredible stability small turning radius smooth riding and super easy to drive | If you own a minivan now and it's not a Toyota it will be well worth your time to drive this around | 
 "words": The resale fit and finish stability reliability transmission engine dash board views and rubber plastic movement and sound surpass the other minivans | The Sienna is heavy duty family grade | We drove the Honda and it was really nice | But not as heavy duty as the Sienna | The Toyota is much studier and feels better on the road | We love this van and I swore I'd never buy one | 
 "words": Although I only have slightly more than 300 miles on my new van I really am enjoying it | I have owned a 1986 and 1996 Dodge Caravan and the Toyota drives much smoother | The interior is plush the seats are very comfortable and the ease of stowing the third row seat is perfect | 
 "words": This is the best vehicle I have ever owned | I am amazed by Toyota's craftsmanship and attention to detail | 
 "words": This is hands down the best minivan on the market | Honda and Nissan don't even come close | First trip out we got 27 | 4 mpg while running the A C | This van turns on a dime better than our Honda Accord | Plenty of power to get you over hills | At 75 mph the engine is only running at about 2200 rpms | We test drove both the Nissan Qwest and the Honda Odyssey and neither come close to the 2007 Toyota Sienna | 
 "words": Had a SUV but wanted better gas performance and needed a big minivan | Very safe side airbags and stability control | Loved the design over the Honda Odyess | But HATE the gas mileage | The best we get is 13-15 city 23-25 hwy after 1900 miles | First week of purchase was getting 8-10 mpg city | Expected better city and hwy | Questioning if I should have keep my SUV or considering going back to one | Drive is nowhere near car like but the wife is happy | She's the primary driver so I won't add my 2 cents in | 
 "words": The more I drive it the more I love it | Great ride awesome power and commendable fuel consumption | A far better value than the Odyssey | Don't get me wrong the Honda is very nice | However the Sienna delivers more room power MPG than the Honda for considerably less | 
 "words": Traded a 2005 Sienna | 07 is same basic vehicle but they've improved and tweaked lots of little things | Noticably more power | Tight and solid so far | Very smooth quiet no wind noise beautiful new dash lighting | Great fit and finish | Seats could use more thigh support | Overall we are very very pleased | Gas mileage appears to be about 18 city 25 highway | We both love to drive it | 
 "words": Can't say enough good stuff about this automobile | Broke it in according to the manual 1000 mls then took it to Niagara Falls and the hills of NY Finger Lake region about 1800 miles | Great ride great room great comfort great gas mileage | Consistent 20 city 26 highway with air on at 65-75mph plus lots of get-up-and-go when needed love those 266 horses | For me the proof will be in this cars longevity | Our family buys a car and squeezes evry bit of usefulness out before donating it to the junkyard usually about 12-15 years | With this recent jaunt I have high expectations until that time | 
 "words": We test drove 6 minivans Sienna Odyssey Sedona Town and Country Entourage Grand Caravan and found the Odyssey and Sienna the most pleasurable to drive | Honda Toyota reliability tend to be similar best in class | We have always owned Hondas and actually prefer the styling of the Odyssey but found the Toyota to be more spacious with better power an an equally smooth ride | 
 "words": I bought it this March 2007 XLE model with 17'' tires tri zone automatic climate control traction control and so on | 
 "words": Bought it because we need a big minivan had side airbags and stability control | Like the van hate the mileage | Absolute best we can get is 15 | 5 city 25 | 5 hwy | Expected better city | Has a rattle in dash otherwise pretty happy so far | 
 "words": Only had it a few days but it is a nice van | I had a Ford Freestar Limited with all the bells and whistles that were available | It was all the bells and whistles that would break or cause me a problem | The LE with pkg 3 is everything I need but nothing extra that could break or give me a headache | The Toyota just feels like a quality vehicle | 
 "words": The third minivan we've owned a 1990 Dodge Caravan a 2001 Honda Odyssey now a 2007 Sienna | Each was best on market at the time | This year it was between Odyssey and Sienna | The Sienna had more comfortable seating and the XLE package 5 had all features we wanted without requiring navigation | 
 "words": This vehicle so far has been great | The seats are very comfortable with plenty of room for all well except for those in the third row | Dashboard is well laid out and illuminated | The drive is quiet and smooth | The engine has plenty of power at all speeds due to a very refined engine and transmission | Plenty of room for the family their gadgets and their drinks | This van also has a great many safety features which anyone would appreciate | 
 "words": Great van bad fuel economy after 4000 miles average 14m g 50 city and 50 freeway driving | 
 "words": This Sienna is a very smooth running minivan with minimal wind and road noise | It has excellent power especially at highway speeds | The Xenon lights do an excellent job | The cruise control has 2 modes regular and laser controlled and I am happy to have a choice | I dislike the 5 MPH speed increment on the cruise control and would much prefer a 1-mph adjustment | In the first 2500 miles of gentle driving I averaged 19 | 4 mpg was hoping for a bit more | 
 "words": I bought the Toyota because I heard of its great quality reputation | After three months with this lug I can't wait until my lease is up | It has been back to the dealer four times thus far poor transmission trim pieces around the a-pillar breaking a wind noise coming from the passenger door that nobody seems to be able to fix | The thing handles like a semi and is about as refined suspension wise | 
 "words": We test drove the Honda Odyssey Toyota Sienna and liked the feel of the Sienna much smoother | There is plenty of interior room for 3 car seats plus cargo | After switching from a 4Runner still getting used to driving the bus but love it nonetheless | 
 "words": This is the Lexus of minivans | Toyota is living up to its reputation | They definitely did their homework and researched everything | We have had the Sienna for a little over a month and it has not disappointed us in the least | We cannot wait to take it on a road trip this summer | 
 "words": We just traded our 2005 Honda Odyssey Touring 37000 miles for a 2007 XLE Sienna | The Sienna has a wonderful drive lovely steering fantastic on Manhattan's awful street surfaces oozes quality is built well is fast and has great brakes | 
 "words": Love it | Shopped all mini vans and SUVs decided on Sienna for comfort and reliability great gas mileage on trips | Not a minivan person but I really like it | 
 "words": We were pleasantly surprised to find the Sienna with better features handling HORSEPOWER etc | less expensive than our previous van 1995 Dodge Grand Caravan LE | It was also was less expensive than the comparably equipped Honda Odyssey which made our decision for us | Quick comparison Toyota has advantage in price and power better stereo and of coursereputation for reliability | Honda maybe handles better feels a tad more car-like and may have a slight edge in styling | We are extremely happy with this vehicle purchase and our children love the backseats | 
 "words": The 2007 Sienna ride is improved greatly compared to the 2004 model we traded | The horsepower increase is noticeable | We frequently find ourselves loading six full sized adults in the Sienna only to have it function completely to our satisfaction | Our experience is an avg | 23 mpg under avg | driving habits | Fit and finish are what one would expect from Toyota | No appreciable road noise | No squeaks or other obnoxious sounds | 
 "words": This is my third Sienna and my kids are grown | It hauls people comfortably and safely | It hauls bicycles and is a changing room at ski resorts | I keep the middle row of seats out and it's convenient for loading everything | I fold the back seats down and load my 4 x 8 foot sheets of plywood for my workshop | Basically there is nothing this thing can't do well | People need to get over the soccer mom stigma of mini vans and the Sienna in particular | This is the most versatile comfortable reliable vehicle I have ever owned | 
 "words": Superb interior finishing excellent display and controls very comfy | 
 "words": Always hated Toyota but after Dodge experience only considered Honda and Toyota | Love driving this van | VERY comfortable excellent feature and feels very solid in a good way not like a tank | Because of the options we wanted we had to go for the limited pricey and ended up getting the power 3rd row seat | That's a pain b c it is much slower than manual and everything must be perfectly out of the way for it to work | Gratuitous technology but we love the other features | 
 "words": This is a great minivan | I have had minivans for many years and this is the best one I have ever driven | It is beautifully designed and comfortable with great performance | 
 "words": This is my first mini van | I purchase the Toyota because it had the best ride and most power | I test drove five manufacturers | I am avg 23 MPG with a heavy foot | I have 3500 miles in 3 weeks vacation trips | Only issues the stereo is a little weak | The indash CD is nice just the sound is not as good as I expected | It does play CDs the MP3 format | I have about 900 songs in the CD drive | The other issue you can control the rear air fan speed from the front but not the temp | You have to reach behind you and adjust the temp from the rear control | Not a safe thing if the van is moving | I can do it but I don't like to | Other than that I absolutely love the van | 
 "words": Just bought my wife her first brand new car or I mean minivan | Drove the 2007 Honda Odyssey EXL-RES and the 2007 Mercury Monterrey | Both are nice vehicles but neither can match the quality power and refinement of the Toyota | The Toyota interior quality is unmatched by the competitors | Remember it's not a minivan | 
 "words": Handles well and is larger than the Honda | Test drove both vans and the Sienna was the best van at a much lower price | We have three small children and thus three car seats | The Sienna has ample room for all the kids and plenty of room for cargo | Roof rack is standard equipment which is also a plus | I would recommend this van to anyone | 
 "words": Coming from a twin turbo Audi it was hard to swallow moving into a minivan and my wife tried hard to talk me out of it | Considered monster SUVs QX56 et al and the Odyssey but I decided with the AWD available in the Sienna it made the most sense | I ordered an 07 limited AWD with Pkg 2 4 | So far I love this Sports Van | It rides almost as smooth as my wife's RX 330 and is quite ergonomically sensible | I know I'll be a fool if I expect the performance of the Audi but the Sienna does not disappoint | It is brisk off the standing start but where it shines is on the highway where you'll need to pay attention to stay within the 15 mph of the speed limit | It's that smooth | 
 "words": Handles like it is three times as heavy as it is underpowered interior could use some refinement | Overall unpleased | 
 "words": It over all is a pretty damn good safe reliable comforting car |
