REVIEWS
 "words": I am not happy at all with the transmission in this car | I am already repairing the clutch | the transmission has too much play and is very finicky with RPM to get a shift at the right time for economy I have always driven stick shifts | I have 48000 on the car right now as I commute a good distance to work | Would not be my choice again | I miss my KIA | 
 "words": I bought my car in April of 07 when I got it it was bone stock I got the blue metallic I've since added 18'wheels intake exhaust chip bigger injectors and ported and polished the intake | Have not had one issue with this car and im a abid street racer I keep up with evos and sti's this is awesome grand stock its very slow but for the money u get lots of standard features shit the Ford Focus there base modek car has crank handles to roll up the Windows | To bad they they dont make the Reno or forenza anymore I think Suzuki was dumb for recalling them | 
 "words": I recently purchased a 5spd Reno 46K for a commuter | I drive 90 miles round trip to work about 90 interstate | The car is better than expected | The editor reviews seem to be a bit harsh | The ride is good pretty quiet handling is OK peppy engine with the 5 spd no problems merging etc | The standard features are way above the economy class norm | The mpg has been close to advertised I have ranged between 26-28 | 5 mpg with an average 25 city 75 hwy driving | Hwy speeds between 70-77 mph | If you are looking for max mpg look elsewhere the Reno offers a pretty good package at the current used prices shop around and get one at trade-in value and you will have a good 1st car or commuter | 
 "words": I had this car for almost 6 motnhs and never had a problem with it | I enjoy driving it and not bad on gas mileage actually I bought the car to save gas even if I was looking for Chevy Cobalt | The dealer gave me this because the cobalt was a little bit expensive and I have another loan that's why they didn't gave me the Cobalt | Anyway I didn't regret having this car | And it can fit up to 5 people including driver and you can park anywhere easy to park and as most everyone's saying | I did expect to get more than 31 miles per gallon but I'm only getting 31 on highway and 24 city | And I compared the back seat to a Chevy Impala SS and the Reno was bigger | I like this car
 "words": I purchased my Reno as a birthday present to myself | I love my car and how it hasn't broken down yet | I've owned mine for about six months now | The interior is very roomy and the instrument panel is very simple and logical | Styling is very European and there's plenty of space in the trunk | My only real complaint about it is that I wish there were a more powerful engine option | I know this is an economy car but I really wish that it had like the SX-4 engine option | The suspension could be a little stiffer I mean it handles well but I'd like less body roll | Again I know this is an economy car but sometimes you may have to do some avoidance maneuver | 
 "words": I have this car less than a year and have no issues so far | It is comfortable quick and good on gas | If you floor it only then do you suffer poor gas mileage | Sometimes I can't help it since I am so impressed by this small motor | For a 2 | 0 this car is very fast | For anyone who doesn't want to hurt their wallet this car beats any toyota that's similar in size | 
 "words": I just purchased one and I love it | Great looks great paint fun to drive | The options it comes with are great am fm cd player front and rear wipers easy controls | Just a lot for a little | I have owned a Focus in the past and there is a lot in this car that the Focus didn't have for the price | And the warranty well that itself almost sold me the car | 
 "words": First off let me tell you that I am one of those guys that races every car I buy | I am a mechanic as well so I do all my own engine work | I have modified my Reno with minor modifications and I do pretty well at the track with it | Because of the type of car that it is no one ever sees it coming and they underestimate it | It does great on a drag strip but the handling leaves a lot to be desired | I bought the car for a work vehicle initially but then my curiosity got the better of me and now that I have raced it I am thoroughly impressed with it | 
 "words": A fun vehicle to own | Not only can I go when I want with the quality travel I want but it is very versatile for a family of 3 me my wife and my 12 month old son | 
 "words": The Suzuki Reno is a superb value | Up and coming Suzuki delivers with just the right formula | It has unique and attractive styling in and out | It also has lots of standard features pretty darn good stereo CD with four 2-way speakers and four 1 tweeters all 8 are door-mounted | I like its smooth acceleration and seamless shifting | It has nice 15 tires with full wheel covers | I also like the 8-way driver seat plus 3-position lumbar support | It's no hot rod but for less than 14000 there's a DOHC 2 | 0 liter 4-cylinder GM-designed engine that is more than adequate made in Australia | Obviously the gas mileage will not be 33 38 like the tin cans out there get but 22 30 ain't bad | Plus you're getting a lot more car for almost the same price | Definitely check this one out | 
 "words": I love it the Reno | It is small sleek stylish has power everything and costs less than 15000 | Enough said | 
 "words": I bought the Reno because I desperately needed a car | I should have done more research | My car has had starting problems many times | It also gets terrible gas mileage for a compact car | I average about 21 mpg with city and highway driving | A friend has an '06 Impala that gets 30 mpg with a V6 engine | The seats are a little uncomfortable and the manual transmission is terrible | How much would a decent linkage cost Suzuki to put in | The engine is also underpowered | I am considering trading in the car for a Cobalt since the reviews that I have read about it are quite good | 
 "words": The Reno has a lot more get up an go than I had expected | On my trip home from the dealer I had stopped for a traffic signal and pulled out when the light changed and was up to 35 mph when I realized I was still in 5th gear | I got 29 mpg on the trip home from the dealer | I decided to drive from home to the top of Whitetop mountain 1600 ft to 3100 ft altitude | It went up the mountain at 40 mph in 5th gear with no feeling of strain or handling problems on the 25 mph curves | When the pavement gave way to gravel and 4 inches of snow I down shifted to 4th gear and slowed down to 35 mpg and zipped past several 4 wheel drive vehicles sitting in the ditches | Mu 49 mpg on the trip was excellent | 
 "words": So far my Reno has been a good solid car | I have the manual transmission | Its power is OK for a car in this class | The interior is a little uncomfortable but with an 8-way adjusting driver seat and plenty of front leg room it's OK | It sounds good I haven't noticed excessive wind noise yet | Backing up is a little troublesome | Coming from a Ford Ranger with a very open rear view it feels a bit claustrophobic looking out the rear window | Overall at the price I bought it I'm very satisfied | 
 "words": I love it | The Reno is everything that I need and nothing that I don't | It is spacious for such a small vehicle | The base level is what I went with and with such an affordable price tag who could pass it up | 
 "words": I was put into a '07 Suzuki Reno after I had | hard start | issues with the 2006 model after having the car for just five days | The | 07 model developed hard start issues again after just five days | The dealer put me back in the | 06 which he claims is fixed | This issue first became apparent in the | 06 last Spring although the company has yet to develop a permanent fix | Suzuki claims through the dealer that the hard start problem is limited to the | 06 and the | 07 I got was a fluke | If I could get Suzuki to void my contract I would and I would never again buy a Suzuki or recommend one to anyone even my worst enemy | Don | t even consider this car |
