REVIEWS
 "words": I love my ss | It reminds me when I was 16 drivin my '56 belair | Just a bit faster a lot more comfort easier to steer and obviously more features | At 24k I had to replace the front brakes 450 wow | That was for brakes turning rotors | It also needs 4 new tires 600 | At 54 years old I can say I have always driven a Chevy | Even though I love this ss I'm getting rid of it | It's time 4 a change | I don't mind the 9 mpg around town on 93 octane 2 | 85 gal | Now but the upkeep is too expensive and I'm used to replacing brakes tires at 50k or 60k not 24k | I hate 2 say it but I'm buying a Toyota | Better quailty better engineering | Sorry gm you can't make they quality anymore | 
 "words": I've had my Trailblazer for about 2 years and already I've had it in the shop 2 times about to be the 3rd time | Twice with the ignition and once with the passenger side window not raising | I'm very disappointed in the lack of quality in this problem | 
 "words": I love this SUV | It is the first 4door car I have ever owned | More powerful than my 70's Vette and 98 Trans Am handles almost as well | And it can haul my family of five comfortably | 
 "words": I drive my Trailblazer mostly in town | After switching over to a synthetic oil I improved MPG's from 15 | 5 to 16 | 5 | I had some front end trouble at 38000 miles | The entire rack and pinion steering system had to be replaced | 1500 | 00 ouch | It's a good SUV | Currently I have 47000 miles on it and no more trouble | 
 "words": In Sept | 2007 I traded in a Ford Taurus SES for a 3LT Trailblazer with the 5 | 3L V8 | I drove the SS and even though the acceleration and handling were impressive the fuel consumption made me rethink | I then drove a 4 | 2L I6 but just after driving the SS it seemed lacking | As the 5 | 3L gets the same mileage as the 4 | 2 I went on the look for one | Not a lot more power than the 4 | 2 but a lot more torque makes for effortless acceleration and quiet cruising | A highway trip today yielded 24 | 6 mpg with the cruise control set 4 mph over the limit | rides smooth seats are comfy and you can beat Lexus LX 470's and GX 470's all day long as there are no external V8 identification badges |

 "words": I think Chevy should have kept this truck in production | The Atlas 4 | 2 inline six has lots of power 291 HP | It pulls our 24' travel trailer with ease | It is so smooth running the factory set up the ignition so that you can not engage the starter while the engine is running | Not that you would want to | The leather 8 way PWR heated seats are great | As is the rest of the toys this truck has | I think the average fuel consumption at 9 | 0L 100km is good | Best I have got was 8 | 2L 100km | I had a 1996 GMC SLT AWD Jimmy that had a 4 | 3 V6 and 190 HP | This is by far a better truck in all areas | I would buy another Trailblazer LT but maybe if fuel cost was not a concern Id jump at the SS Trailblazer | 
 "words": My fiance and I purchased our TrailBlazer as a third vehicle for road trips to visit family in the north east | Gas mileage isn't stellar but for the type of vehicle it is I think it's fine | Interior is basic but that's exactly what we wanted and it fits the price | The exterior is very Chevrolet and brawny | The tight turning radius is extremely welcomed in the congested traffic we have in DC | The ride is great for a BOF SUV and it feels nimble and brakes adequately for it's size | Acceleration is fine but at times it feels as though it could use some more power | I guess I'm spoiled as my daily driver is a 2005 GTO | Overall the vehicle is perfect for our needs | 
 "words": Ok go out there and try to find something like this for the money good luck | This is a very fast truck accelerates sounds handles and drives like a sports car | I bought it used 13k miles one owner fully loaded paid 24k could not be happier | Drive as a company car need all the room to put all my stuff puts a big smile in my face every time I press the gas pedal | OK gas mileage stinks what can you expect | 6 | 0 liters 395HP 405Lb torque you will feel them you need a lot of gas to put out those numbers I get 13MPG average which is comparable to a lot of V8 trucks out there | If it snows where you are get AWD and get grippier tires than the OEM Goodyears
 "words": I really like the vehicle and it's very comfortable | When my spouse and daughter get into the car they love to fall asleep because the leather seating is so comfortable | My coworkers do the same thing | I do not like that the battery drains quickly when I leave the vehicle sitting in the parking lot over 3 days | 
 "words": I've always been a Chevy fan | But after a few purchases in the 1980's and 1990's I felt the build quality had went downhill so much I was wary of buying another Chevrolet product | I am no longer wary of the Chevrolet brand | Since buying this 2007 TrailBlazer well over a year ago I have nothing but praise for it | No problems what so ever | Build quality is outstanding | The ride and handling are great | The acceleration is wonderful | Highly recomended | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle new in the fall of 07 as a left over | I put about 40K miles on a truck per year | I have been impressed with the power and fuel economy of the inline 6 | I have had less than stellar reviews for the fit and finish and the vehicle locks | The interior console is poorly designed | I hate the OnStar big brother thing and the original tires | I now have a passenger side window track that is broke and I'm out of warranty in 13 mos | I'll probably keep this car for a long time but I get the feeling that its going to be expensive | If the American auto manufacturers are going to make it they are going to have to pay attention to details stop worrying about gimmicks 
 "words": I've had my Trailblazer about a year | I bought it slightly used | Overall it has been good | I've had a problem with the rack and pinon steering 1000 repair and the power door locks failing to lock the rear glass using the key fob | I feel very safe and secure as I drive and there is no wind noise | Overall a good purchase
 "words": I have been driving Chevys for my entire life | My family has always owned Chevys as does my wife's | This vehicle by far out does any of the previous Chevy models | Yes the interior is the Chevy basics but the comfort level can't be matched | The seat feels like you're sitting in a recliner everytime you drive | 
 "words": This is by far the best SUV my wife and I have ever driven or ridden in | The ride is as smooth as can be the handling is amazing the looks are awesome and we get 20 mpg which is great for an SUV of its size | It has lots of leg room as well as a lot of luggage space | It gets up and goes great | The safety features are first class | We have put quite a bit of mileage on it and changing the oil is really the only maintenance it has needed | Great vehicle | 
 "words": I have owned two TrailBlazers and both provided great ownership | This latest vehicle is an LT model the previous one was an LS and we really like the added features | We have leather and a sunroof and the 17-inch wheels | The color is Moondust metallic and is really a nice color doesn't show the dirt as much | We also have the OnStar and XM radio options which are wonderful | This vehicle provides a nice ride and good utility with the rear seats down | I avg | about 18 | 2 MPG in town and 19 | 9 MPG on the h'way | at 70 MPH higher MPH the MPG decreases | For an SUV this size and comfort I don't consider that too bad | I have regular maintenace done and have had no issues with both TrailBlazers | 
 "words": I was going to buy a Corvette and have a second vehicle for a daily driver | That was all until I drove my 3 SS TrailBlazer | I have driven many rental car regular TrailBlazers and the difference is amazing | You wouldn't think you're in the same manufacturer's vehicle | Word of advice if you buy one do not put a straight pipe on it way way too loud | Gas mileage stinks but its a 6 | 0 V8 | It's very fun to drive on the twisties but not as fast as I initially thought | Can't beat a Mustang GT or a Z28 however it does accelerate hard and shifts very hard I really like that part | Beat a 350Z and any other SUV with the exception of the Jeep Grand Chrokee SRT8 and Cayenne Turbo | Overall I absolutely LOVE it | Can't complain | 
 "words": I have driven a lot of SUV's and this is the worst by far | Rides like a truck the trim seal on the doors is already falling off | Too small inside horrid cup holders | Doesn't feel like it holds the ground well | Drinks gasoline like plants drink water | HATE IT | Would love to get rid of it | 
 "words": Very nice ride | Interior is very light but comfortable | It rides like a bigger suv but handles like a small one | I have been very happy with the comfort but wish I would have gotten a lighter color | Black is horrible to keep clean
 "words": I love the look of this SUV | Pros love the heated seats sunroof stereo tons of leg room in the front and the back | Cons the 4 wheel drive is horrible | Not enough traction | The seats are not deep enough | I feel like I'm going to slide off every time I brake and no | I'm not a big person | 
 "words": The Trailblazer SS is an excellent all around performer | My wife loves it and im pretty partial to it my self | Again its a great truck | Just dont hit a patch of ice in southern Texas at 30 mph it will send you through a fence and in to a field | 
 "words": I was looking for something practical then I test drove the TrailBlazer SS | I forgot all about gas mileage when I put my foot on the gas come 395 hp in a SUV Corvette base block engine Chevy you went to far | The interior a little sporty for a 51 year old I think not | This vehicle still turns head a 21 2 years old | The Bose sound system is awesome it handles like a sports car but with enough comfort to make a trip through the mountains fun | Who knew radio XM could sound so good I just purchased 3 years so I would always have it | Overall my TrailBlazer SS is a bunch of fun although an ave | of 13 mpg in the city is tough | 
 "words": This is my second TrailBlazer | I loved my 2004 so much when it came time to trade in I just had to get another even after shopping around to other trucks | This is a reliable well built truck that is as comfortable as can be and still is capable of off roading here in Utah with ease | Perfect amount of space and great easy to use features and reliability | I have never had to have either of my trucks serviced for anything except the basic upkeep | I have the leather seats on star xm radio and bose stereo | this truck rocks | 
 "words":  Screamer | Fast as hell w o the gas guzzler 6 | 0 AWD of the SS | I own a 4 | 2L Envoy the 5 | 3L gets 2 MPG better | Remember these are SUV's not Corvettes | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle for a few weeks now and I really love it | The ride is smooth and quiet | I don't have the leather seats and really don't care | I have the Bose sound system which is great | The engine is great as well | I would recommend the Trailblazer to anyone | It's in between sporty and big at the same time | 
 "words": Have had the car about one month | Love it have had two new C6 Corvettes a 98 2001 | This is not a Vette but is a lot of fun anyway | My wife had a 2004 Trailblazer and wanted a new one | She wanted a sunroof and such | I wanted a Vette so we met about half way | The power is great | The gas mileage is not as bad as I thought | The first tank was on a trip over trailridge and back was 19 | 5 this is at 10500 feet over sea level | It did not know we were on a hill | All the power you could use | 
 "words": I've had the SS for a few weeks now and I love it | It has the feeling of a car except you're sitting up higher | The fuel economy is pretty poor but what do you expect for an SUV with a Corvette based engine | The engine has a nice rumble to it | I've always had vehicles with leather but opted for the cloth on this one and I couldn't be happier | The seats are actually more comfortable than the leather | Overall I'm very happy with the Trailblazer and would highly recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": I just bought my first SUV and I always wanted a Trailblazer so I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to buy one | I was not disappointed at all | It drives like its floating on air | When going up the hills it has some kick to it not like my little 4 cylinder and shifts very smooth | My kids even love it | 
 "words": Big roomy and powerful | Sure the interior is bland and plain but it is functional and the seats are comfy | Other SUV's such as the Pathfinder or 4runner look nice with their shiny futuristic dashboards however I have ridden in both and the seats are like sitting on a padded ironing board | 
 "words": Great ride in a midsize high- performance SUV | Quiet smooth ride and handling responsive steering and super turning radius | Have averaged over 17 mpg by using cruise control and not lighting up the tires on highway | Fairly comfortable seating and easy entry and exit | Extremely pleased with purchase | Get more compliments from admirers than my last three Cadillacs | 
 "words": I've had it for a year | It's a wonderful compromise between a sports car and a family vehicle | Better than an X5 fraction of the cost | 
 "words": I traded in a Subaru to get more size and towing ability and the TrailBlazer seemed like an excellent choice | The interior is very comfortable the motor has great power and the mileage has been acceptable | My family loves it and my dogs are so impressed that they actually sit quietly in the back seat | I'd recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": Not oversized and not gaudy looking this truck has a personality all its own | I wouldn't trade it for anything else on the market and I have only had it a month | Takes me back to the 69 70 era of the 396 Chevelle SS which I owned and had many hours of driving fun with my friends and fellow SS owners | 
 "words": I just purchased a 2007 TBSS 3SS LT package | I said I would never buy an American made car or truck | I just couldn't take my eyes off the truck | So far I'm impressed by its performance and handling | The ride is solid and firm at the same time smooth | With a few things modded this SUV will really wake up | I love the Bose sound system with XM radio | If you're in the market for an SUV with Camaro SS performance and handling and plenty of room for the kids look in to a Trailblazer SS you can't go wrong with this truck | 
 "words": I moved from Michigan to Eastern Tennessee | I found the Silverado awkward to drive in a city with lots of hills and curves | When I saw the TrailBlazer I knew it's what I wanted | It has a trailer hitch the same as my pickup | so I can pull my utility trailer when hauling is needed and enjoy the comfort and convenience of an SUV when not working | It has lots of power | Finally this SUV is handsome | 
 "words": This is my second TrailBlazer | The first one I had was a 2004 and I loved it absolutely no trouble out of it | Upgraded to a few more features | The car looks great and drives great
 "words": Got it not expecting much | Rides like a limo and extremly roomy | Doesn't feel too big either
 "words": I traded in a 1998 Blazer | I would like to have bought a new one but they no longer make them | That car was 9 years old with nothing but the usual maintenance | This 2007 TrailBlazer is a little higher off the ground than I would like but still my best choice for a purchase | The vehicle rides much better then the '98 I've only had it for a week so I'll have to see what the fuel economy is | All in all I like it | 
 "words": Fantastic | I test drove a lot of cars before purchasing my SS | I traded an Envoy in which I hated from day one and swore never to look at that body style again but low and behold this truck is absolutely a fun fast beefy monster | I also own an '05 Suburban which I though I'd never want to get into something smaller | This TrailBlazer SS is the best value for the money out there great rebates and incentives saved over 5000 of of a sticker of 35900 | 
 "words": Purchased the TrailBlazer a few days ago and I love it | I tested many other SUVs and this SUV beat it | The sales person gave me the impression the car came with more features and mislead me in our conversations | Thankfully I knew more about the car coming into the dealership and was prepared | 
 "words": Still cannot understand how I got this vehicle | Noisy doesn't keep the road the interior is just like they were making cars in late 80's | It has only 10000 on it but have already fixed it 5 times | The best feature is to turn wipers on | I've been cursing the designer's mother since I tried to turn wipers first time | That was my last American car | 
 "words": We recently replaced a Pontiac Grand Prix GTP w this and are very pleased | The ride is great the fuel mileage is O | K | w the 8 cyl | 17 | 5 to 21 | 7 but we have not taken it on any trips yet | We got every option on this except the DVD player and like it all | What a pleasure to drive and to park | 
 "words": I have loved the TrailBlazer look since it came out but never wanted to pay 30k for an inline 6cyl | Problem solved | I have been a Vette owner and this is a four door cargo carrying Vette | It rides great handling is amazing braking is very impressive and it's just the right size for this kind of power | The clean exterior with little badging is such a tasteful look | I got a 2007 fully loaded minus nav for just over 30k and the 6001 lb gvwr makes it a nice tax deduction | I know the mileage is bad but that's not why you are buying this vehicle | Buy one | 
 "words": I finally got the SUV of my dreams | My initial purchase trip was for the CTS-V instead I test drove the TrailBlazer SS and could not leave the driver's seat until I went inside to sign the contract | I have left Mustang GT's eating my dust and just love the growl of the exhaust | Chevrolet did us truck fans proud when they Nürburgring'd this one for us | If you seek excellent reliable transportation with some ooomph get-up-and-go this is the one | 
 "words": Have been driving my new '07 Trailblazer LT for a week now and absolutely love it | 4 wheel drive is fantastic and the ride and feel of the car is great | 18 inch rims look very sharp and have turned a few heads already | Great SUV and would highly recommend it | 
 "words": This vehicle is a great buy for the price | Bose option is fabulous | Gets in and out of parking like a smaller vehicle | Large rear cargo area | Sits high like a Siverado | Great in traffic | 
 "words": Not a bad truck | Has alot of power | Drives pretty smooth for a truck handles well | All around truck | I am a car guy | Has just as much power as my CTSV that tells it all | 
 "words": After much debate I finally purchased the '07 TrailBlazer SS | Didn't get a lot of the frills bought mostly for performance and I absolutely love the power and exterior looks | Not too crazy about the interior dash and the standard radio | Would definitely suggest at least getting the upgraded Bose sound system | The fuel economy isn't that great which seems to get less than my 02 Infiniti QX4 rated with the same mpg of 15 city and 19 hwy | 
 "words": I love my new 2007 TrailBlazer | I had a 2002 TrailBlazer and just traded it in on the '07 | It's loaded | The comfort level is most awesome | I will never own a different type of SUV | It's just pure sweetness | Thank you Chevy for making such a fine ride | I find myself wanting to ride in it all day long | 
 "words": This one is fun to drive and very quick | The 6 | 0 has more than enough power | The interior is well done but there are some cheap plastics on the doors and dash | The rubber trim on the exterior winshield had to be glued back on after an 80 mph cruise | Overall much more satifying than my 2005 EB Explorer | I recently took a 400 mile trip all on the interstateand averaged 17 | 2 mpg at 75mph | The same trip in the 4 | 0 liter Explorer averaged 19 | 5 | 
 "words": This vehicle handles great | It also has all the power you would need with the 400hp Corvette engine | The sunroof did leak but the dealership repaired it for me | The only downfall is that it gets bad gas mileage at 17 on the highway with the Corvette getting 27 on the highway | Overall I would have to say this is a great vehicle though | 
 "words": I love this truck | It is very comfortable steers and handles beautifully | Feels like a luxury vehicle but with towing and 4 x 4 | All the safety features like OnStar and side air curtains are a comfort | And it looks real good | I rode in back seat recently and love the rear seat heater with upper and lower choices and fan speed | Did I say I love this truck | Am looking forward to driving this for many miles | 
 "words": I just got my SS just the other day | I went from a C320 Benz to this SUV and it is awesome | From the 20' wheels to its power | I found myself going from leather to cloth and I enjoy it a lot more than I thought | This is the first SUV I have owned and I don't think that I will go after another car again from owning the SS | 
 "words": The comfort of my TrailbBlazer is one in a million | The sunroof is large and the heated leather seats are so welcome on a cold morning | The TrailBlazer rides beautifully and handles going into parking spaces easier then a smaller car | The memory seats have been great for me as I let my spouse drive it on weekends | After driving this vehicle I would not go back to driving a car again | I love my Trailblazer LT | 
 "words": Reliable | Comfortable to ride and drive | Handles exceptionally well a real surpise and pleasure | I recommend it to anyone who enjoys driving and likes to get out of town | 
 "words": After having one Blazer I had to buy another and this new '07 is awesome | I love the sunroof stereo handling and everything about it | Test drive one today You will be happy you did | Lots of pick up and easy access to all | 
 "words": I know that it is too soon to make any long term judgement but the TrailBlazer we bought exceeds our expectations | When researching vehicles we consistantly read that the suspension of the TB was less than 'good' which kept us from considering the TB | We had a relative who drove an '06 and they said that they were pleased with the ride and handling | We got the LT loaded and so far can't drive it enough | Incidently we also drove the SS | If it had not looked too 'pretentious' for a couple of 50 it was tempting | 
 "words": Overall I think that the SS is a good value for the money | I went from an '04 VW Touareg with almost every option stickering at 52 to the TB SS that stickered for 42 and after rebates and supplier discount picked the truck up for 30K | A lot quicker believe it or not better gas mileage and don't have the typical VW Annoyances like electrical problems and poor craftsmanship that they charge top dollar for and look at you funny when you complain about it | Seats are fairly comfortable on long trips maybe adjustable headrests for us taller folk | Fuel economy isnt the greatest but what sports car is | Overall its a tight feeling and riding vehicle would recommend for an everyday car | 
 "words": I had an '03 TrailBlazer LT | The first year I swore I'd never own another | The next 2 1 2 years it was very reliable enough so that when my saleman called me with a deal that was too good to refuse I went for a fully loaded LT with leather sunroof heated seats | Subtle interior changes make it seem a lot classier than the '03 | The only exterior change is a restyled grille and a lower hangover on the rear bumper so you can't see the spare tire | If this one is as reliable as the last one after the first year I'll be driving this well over 100k | 
 "words": I'm really enjoying my TrailBlazer SS | If you have owned a previous TrailBlazer I promise your experience was nothing like the SS | It looks rides and drives like a totally different vehicle | I drive mine daily and hate when I have to get out | Fuel economy is about like that of a 1 2 ton truck and the power is awesome | 
 "words": This vehicle is simply the finest SUV I have had | I am a big guy at 6 | -5 | and over 300 | I fit fine and this thing is fast | I mean we are talking an SUV here folks but it gets down and goes | I have always had SUV | s or Trucks and my last was a 450hp supercharged Avalanche | This is so much more fun | The suspension is tight and very predictable | If you want one get one | I needed one | I got mine and you can | t have it | Enjoy 
 "words": I've only had mine for five months but I've been tracking the production of the SS since its days on the drawing board | Working in a Chevy dealership makes me a bit biased I guess but this car is all I was hoping it would be | I love driving my car every day | The only drawbacks would be the fuel economy and the lack of a dual exhaust | Go out and buy one | It's a blast | 
 "words": It's easy to handle | Easy to get in and out of places | Very dependable | Very easy to get in and out of |
