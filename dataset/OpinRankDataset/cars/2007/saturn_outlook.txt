REVIEWS
 "words": I had my 2007 in the shop over 90days the first year of ownership | They were really nice until I decided to file the lemon Law on it | The leaks were horrible and the milage was never what they claimed | I believe that there are electrical issues now from all the water that it had | 
 "words": Six repairs of sunroof leaks and three repairs of windshield wiper failures | Carpets replaced by dealer but mold is still present above headliner | Lucky I am still alive after wiper failures in heavy rainstorms | Battery has also died on me at least five times | I am embarrassed to admit that I am an American engineer | GM should be ashamed of themselves | Great design poor execution | 
 "words": We were looking for a 7-8 passenger vehicle and chose the Outlook over the CX-9 | The Outlook's extra space was well worth it | I've sat in the rear row with my daughter with no problem | The middle row has all the room of a limousine when pushed all the way back | My wife gets 17 mpg in all-city driving | I get 20-24 mpg on the highway but driving over 65 really kills the mileage the faster you go | This was our first GM car and we had a number of build quality issues catching compartment door finicky reading-light switches dead seat heater | It was one of the first 1000 built though if I read the VIN correctly | 
 "words": I've had my Outlook a little over 2years and really have no regrets | We wanted a large vehicle with plenty of leg-room in all rows | We researched lots of models SUVs particularly cross- overs | We are very happy with our choice | Although it's not perfect its certainly doin' its job and some | We've taken long car trips 12-hr drive to Detroit 5 pass | It was great comfortable and enough space inside for storage | However I would prefer a step for mounting | The Outlooks pick-up could stand improvement | I've made my own driving adjustments to suffice but the cross- over would do so much better with more power | Fuel economy is between 16-18 mpg | 
 "words": We have owned Saturns in the past | We currently own a SC2 that's 13yrs have had no issues | And during these past years have recommended Saturn to many relatives friends | After many months researching for a new growing family vehicle we chose the Outlook 4wd XR | We were thrilled of the many standard features 8 seats mpg and that it handles the road well | But once having it home driving on our many hilly roads unlike the flat roads near the dealership the shifting is horrible | Then our front passenger door leaked got that fixed | Next the front driver's side door leaks today we noticed the driver's side rear seat belt slot is leaking | What's next | Hence the disappointment
 "words": We have owned it just less than a year and I feel it is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned | Have had the tranny fixed through warranty recall and that has helped with fuel economy | Has lots of power and is great in the snow handled a Canadian winter with no problem at all | We have travelled with 8 adults and all loved the ride and comfort | Relatives have the Pathfinder and Edge no comparison in any category | 
 "words": we bought this car over the CX-9 and Veracruz mainly for space 3 active teenagers and 11 yr-old | Gas mileage was also a consideration | Did homework tested and waited for right time to buy | So far it's been two years we have no regrets | It's the best 7 plus seater we've ever owned | Excellent comfort took the car all the way to Florida and back from Pittsburgh no problems | The only minus is transmission | It's a little worse than a turbo-charged car could complete a laundry cycle before it downshifts | But kinda got used to it by now | Also the gas mileage is not all that it advertises to be | A little advise buy with fewest accessories as possible then you can avoid pain in malfunction
 "words": Complaints first Biggest problem with GM vehicles is there lack of respect for our lungs | NO CABIN FILTER common guys | All the imports have them you could at least make a Hepa grade filter to show up the imports | Do you think we are stupid | Gas Mileage average 16-17 all the time city highway does not matter | I regularly maintenance every 5K and also had trans soft upgrade twice does not help mileage | Other than that the SUV still looks good has a comfortable ride and lots of space | Great family car and I could almost like it a real lot | I am very upset about the NON-CABIN FILTER | I like my lungs a whole whole lot and nothing is more important than your health | Listen up GM | 
 "words": My wife loves the car but can't seem to find enough gas money | Fuel economy stinks | The layout is perfect for a family | The car has no power and is a nightmare in the snow or ice traction control is a joke | I would have rather bought a Tahoe better fuel economy and better performance | 
 "words":  My frustrations have been mostly with the DVD system NAV | After much trouble-the whole system it was replaced by the dealer | It is still not good quality-the DVD's constantly skip pause with even a slight fingerprint or scratch | I would highly recommend not getting the factory player | Best Buy has models that are far superior in performance and can be leather matched and are still much less expensive | NAV is not close to Garmin quality either | Also seat memory and mirror position have never worked correctly-but not a huge deal to me | And voice command system doesn't always work or respond | Great car just don't waste money on these options to avoid major frustration | 
 "words": We have been driving our Saturn Outlook XE AWD for a few weeks now and must say that we have never had such an enjoyable new car thrill which only grows the more we drive it | With a combination of a growing family and rising fuel prices we needed a car which would come to the rescue | The Saturn Outlook was the solution period | Compared to all other competitors especially the so-called high quality foreign models Saturn Outlook delivers an enormous level of cabin space power and fuel-economy | The absolutely stunning handling and ride of this car just blew me away | Braking and road presence feed back to the driver make this respond like something much smaller | Wow
 "words": Saturn has come back | This is the best vehicle Saturn has ever offered | It has style comfort and class | It holds its own with anyone | The quality and ride is in par with larger SUV's | We love this vehicle our large teenagers fit in it with ease | Often we have to transport kids to and from sports and extra things | We have purchased a Saturn for the first time in 1991 and loved that car but we soon out grew it | Now that Saturn has come out with this true crossover it helped us to come back to the Saturn name | The engine has plenty of power for hauling kids and gear plus it can tow a small camper or a trailer for our snowmobiles | We are very pleased with our new Saturn Outlook and will enjoy | 
 "words": So far this vehicle has been impressive to me | I'd buy another Saturn just based upon this one and I always thought they were budget vehicles | You'd never guess it was a Saturn | I looked at both the Buick and the GMC the Saturn's prices are better the cars are all exactly the same to us with some aesthetic differences but not enough to justify the huge price gap | 
 "words": There is nothing on the market like the Outlook | It has a smooth quiet ride | The engine is powerful but fuel-efficient | The seats fold flat | The third-row seat is functional | The interior gives you more room than a Sequoia and you get better gas mileage
 "words": I shopped around at the Nissan Murano Mazda CX-9 and several other vehicles | I think I drove them all | The Saturn Outlook was the best all around | Bigger than the Murano and better mpg | Seats are really comfortable and it is very affordable even with all the bells and whistles | I couldn't be happier | This one is a keeper | 
 "words": I recently owned an '03 TrailBlazer and this has so much more power and giddyupness | It's amazing that it gets such fuel economy | Very beautiful colors available also | No icky colors | Very quiet | Very much recommend | Best 8 passenger CUV in the market today | 10 10 stars | Seriously drive one | You will love it | 
 "words": Has the room of a minivan without the look | Build quality appears better than the Honda and Toyota and is much more fun to drive | The third row is big enough for adults which is rare in this vehicle category | The 3 | 6 engine and 6 speed auto supply plenty of power even though this vehicle is around 5000 lbs | I think GM and Saturn have a winner and it's built here in Lansing MI | 
 "words": Saturn did a very good job in the design and build of the Outlook | I've had no problems with my Outlook | It's enjoyable to drive and versatile | It has decent mileage for a seven passenger vehicle which is truly a comfortable 7 passenger vehicle | 
 "words": I love this vehicle | iI is the best all around SUV on the market | Seats seven and gets 25 MPG on the highway | Looks great too | Ride and handling are great | 
 "words": We purchased our Outlook 2 weeks ago and have already taken a 1500 mile trip to Tennessee with it | I had a blast using the manual shift in low on the twisty mountain roads and limiting the transmission to 5th gear in strong wind and rain on the highway to prevent excessive automatic up and down shifting between fifth and sixth gear | It handled excellent in all weather conditionsincluding heavy rain and wind that was barely noticed while driving | The gas mileage increased more while driving 80-85 than it did driving 70-75 | An overall good looking vehicle with lots of room and creatures features inside | Our Outlook gets lots of looks in our hometown | We are very happy with it | 
 "words": I am very impressed with Saturn | I have been looking for a replacement for my wife's '02 Chevy Tahoe for a year now | Something a little smaller and a little better gas mileage but did not want to give up the room we had | Well we found it the 2007 Outlook XR | I will admit I was apprehensive | We have owned our Tahoe for 5 years and have looked at every make and model on the market | My wife wouldn't even go to the lot with me to look at it its a Saturn she said but after I drug her down there and she drove it she liked it | now that she has been driving it for a little while she loves it | If you're in the market give it a chance and at least go look at it | I don't think you will be disappointed | 
 "words": This vehicle is phenemonal | Great handling power and comfort | Everybody loves the looks and are surprised that GM Saturn could build a vehicle that is superior to a Toyota in every way | I am happy to say that this vehicle can stand up to the Lexuses Acuras and BMWs of the world for 15000 less | I love the attention that this vehicle brings | 
 "words": Saturn out did itself with this one | I have friends with the Pilot 4runner and Durango and all of them compliment me on my SUV | The front grille is like nothing I've seen before and people stare when I drive by | So in good faith I would recommend this vehicle to anybody | 
 "words": After 4 years of driving a minivan we still needed to haul kids dog stuff but were tired of the mushy ride and uncomfortable seats of our otherwise well functioning minivan | Our Outlook has a responsive car-like feel very comfortable seats excellent seating configuration for third row passengers very nice AWD without the high step-in of a similar sized SUV | The electronics are awesome | The third row head curtain airbags were a key safety feature that we wanted and this car was one of the few that had that option | It's a very thoughtfully designed car with lots of bang for the buck | We contiunue to be very happily surprised by this vehicle | 
 "words": Its been two weeks and about 700 miles | This vehicle is a pleasure to drive | Mileage mixed 50-50 is 19 | 0 | Had some second row passengers and they commented Why are you going so slow | This was on a back road 40 mhp limit which I was doing and told them to their surprise | The Outlook soaked up the bumps and took turns with ease | The large isolated wheelbase contributes to the slow feeling | Yet the handling is solid | I would recommend this to the Highlander and Pilot seekers who may now be able to consider an American product in the fastest selling segment class of vehicle | 
 "words": I have owned this car for two months | It has nearly 9000 miles on it | I have received a recall for the air bag system but have had no other problems | I have carried 7 men in the car fairly comfortably they tell me on a 300 mile round trip | The car has performed well and has been excellent in snow | Overall I would reccomend this vehicle | 
 "words": This is my wife's car | She researched 16 SUV's prior to purchase | The last three3 was the Lexus RX-350 Acura MDX and the Saturn Outlook | All three have almost identical bells and whistles | The Lexus was the quietest however the Outlook was almost as quiet | All handled well | Lexus didn't seem to take corners quite as well as the outlook MDX | The cost for the Outlook was about 10K less than the other two | And the Outlook had 100k warrenty with 0 financing for 60 mths | I can't comment about the mileage yet not enough driven miles | 
 "words": We took a great length of time in evalauating all available SUV and CUV and found Saturn Outlook to be best in class | This is our first American car | It has more head and leg room overall | This is the only vehicle in SUV CUV class with a practical 3rd row enough leg and head room for 3-adults | Saturn has outdone themselves with this product its comfortable and stylish with excellent finish both inside and outside with lots of well thoughtout details for convenience and comfort | We found this vehicle to be better then Acura MDX Nissan Armada and even Audi Q7 and it cost atleast 10000 less then those automotives | 
 "words": After almost 3 months the car is almost perfect | No issues other than std | first year recalls | Wish I would have gotten memory seats and I'm not crazy about the tires in the touring package but still love the vehicle | 6'7 and I'm incredibly comfortable with plenty of room for the two dogs and probably a child seat next year | 
 "words": Excellent vehicle | Have a baby on the way | Had to get rid of my Wrangler and my wife had to get rid of her VW Beetle | But we are so pleased with the Outlook that is has made life a little easier | Didn't want a minivan and we found this | Nice ride extremely comfortable and feels sturdy | 
 "words": We love our Outlook | The styling and handling is superior to all other vehicles in our budget for our family | The seats are adequately comfortable | The versatility of up to 8 adult passengers impressive engine and fuel economy is a welcome change to this market | 
 "words": We picked up our all new 2007 Outlook over the holidays in December | We have purchased or leased 17 vehicles over the past 18 years | So far it is one of the best vehicles we have ever owned | The engine is strong same 3 | 6 litre that is standard in the Cadillac STS | The 6-speed automatic shifts smooth | The ride is firm and confident | Our XE model is front wheel drive better fuel mileage | so far we are averaging almost 20 mpg | We just had a snow storm and the stability control system worked very well | 
 "words": After much research and driving the competition we bought the outlook XR | For 3000 more than the competetors- Pilot Highlander it was well worth the investment | The cabin is a much roomier and the smart slide seats are wonderful | The ride is luxurious the steering tight and responsive and it provides plenty of power and pep | Safety features are hard to beat | an impressive SSF of 1 | 34 low percentage roll over airbags everywhere 1 year on-star service built in seat belt clips for the little ones the list goes on and on | The powertrain warranty is decent 5 yrs 100000 and boasts a sharp interior exterior design | I knew I had a winner when my father said I need one of these | 
 "words": Finally General Motors has built a vehicle that is outstanding in every way | I read the review on the GMC Arcadia and went to my local Saturn dealer to see the outlook | I was very impressed | I went back a month later and drove one | That was it I was sold | This SUV performs like a car | Great power from the engine great amenities quiet and a well thought out design for the interior and exterior | Very comfortable on long trips | The HID lights 19inch wheels dual sunroofs are great touches that you don't see a lot in General Motors vehicles like this | They didn't hold back with this one | 
 "words": The mileage is way below what is advertised 17 24 | I drive almost exclusively highway and am averaging about 16mpg | Geez I got that in my 4WD Avalanche driving the same routes and speed | 6 speed transmission shifts out of overdrive on the mildest incline even at 70mph on the highway | When going very slow the low gear pitches you around on wavey surfaces such as in a parking lot | It has that annoying accelerator lag and it has a very pronounced shift lag when it's cold out | It's free wheeled the engine like missing the gear when trying to quick shift a stick | when it lags and you take your foot off the gas | Gas gauge erratic drops 1 8 in 20 mi or says on fumes with 1 4 left | 
 "words": Family of 5 3 kiddos 9 7 4 replaced our 2000 Caravan Sport with the Outlook XE | We bought because Saturn didn't offer vehicles to keep up with their loyal customers growing families Other family mobile is a Suburban this is the perfect answer | Even the 4 year old can manage in and out with the center row seat setup | Excellent performer in the ice and snow tcs and antilocks minimize control issues | Long rides are comfortable manual shifting is fun in the hilly-twisty road areas | Accessibility from all 5 doors is great nothing is ever out of reach | Powerful exterior design matched to comfortable well styled interior | If you're even thinking about one buy it no regrets | 
 "words": Awesometo quote my kids | Excellent looks and ride | More car for the money | It easily outshines other more expensive cars on the road | The interior is spacious | The engine is powerful and quiet | No road noise and great feedback from the steering and handling | When you look at it then drive it you feel you should have paid more | Without a doubt in my mind I made the absolute right choice in this purchase | Way to go GM | P | S | my family and friends want one now | 
 "words": This is the best SUV ever | It has all of the features I would want in a minivan but its not so I do not feel like the typical soccer mom when I drive it | The dual sunroofs are cool | I love OnStar | I have already used it to unlock my car doors twice | The navigation system is helpful when we are driving in a unfamilar location | The memory settings are great because my husband likes to take the Outlook whenever he can and the memory settings make switching between drivers easy | XM Radio is entertaining when I am stuck in traffic or waiting for my kids | The automatic liftgate is fantastic when my hands are full | The DVD system is great for screaming kids | You must test drive this SUV | 
 "words": Just moved out of an 2003 Olds Silhouette Premier into the Outlook XE | What a difference | For the same money this car feels more competent is quieter more powerful and more comfortable | We should get comparable MPG | Yes it is a different class of automobile minivan vs crossover | However we are not giving up much in terms of usable space and gaining in so many other categories | Besides my wife wanted a functional car that did not scream soccer mom | I am thoroughly impressed | GM did a great job designing it | Let's hope it proves to be reliable | More details to come | 
 "words": I consider this Saturn XR to be an outstanding vehicle | After pricing other comparable SUV's you realize that you are getting a lot for your money | It is big roomy very comfortable and quiet | I love the styling that GM gave this SUV | I feel the interior is well thoughtout and made extremely well | When optioned out the Saturn XR is 10000 to 1200 less than a Ford Expedition | The 3 | 6 liter engine with the 6 speed automatic transmission has plenty of power to get this big guy moving up to speed easily | GM has definitely got a winner with this one | 
 "words": I was impressed when I read the reviews more impressed when I test drove one | But when my wife drove and said she loved it we had to buy it | I traded in a 2005 Dodge Magnum R T hemi for this XR Outlook and I'm not sorry I did | In my opinion what a beautiful car crossover it is | I'm a big guy and I am so comfortable driving it | Plus all the safety features 3 different sets of airbags to protect you no matter what happens AWD traction control and the super audio system with the sub-woofer sounds incredible the car rides quiet no wind noise | I feel that it's alot of car for the money | 
 "words": It's lower to the ground than your larger SUV so it's easer for disabled and older people
 "words": Looks great ride is solid and I love the XM radio | It has the extra width that compares to riding in a full size pick up but handles more like our VUE | 
 "words": I bought this car with every option in the book | It is very comfortable and spacious | The cargo space even with the third row seat up is very good | The only problem I have ancountered and it is not a small one is the sluggish transmission | Once you've passed take off the thing will stay on gear forever before shifting to the next speed | This usually happens at or around the 40 mph mark | It's like it's stuck on that gear and won't move up unless you put the pedal to the floor | If they could do some sort of software update on the throttle gear ratio the car would be perfect | 
 "words": I have an 2007 Outlook and it is bad | Since the first month the car makes some sort of noise that they can not fix | The things in the inside keep breaking | Mirror dashboard compartment CD player | I must have a lemon car or something | I may not ever buy another Saturn again in my life | This has been the worst year as a car owner since I have been old enough to buy a car | 
 "words": I studied every brand of vehicle and visited many dealers all around comparing every way I could | Outlook claimed the best mpg with other great features so I bought it | After my great disappointment I began talking to other owners and reading reviews | I now believe I see enough agreement with my experience to warrant some kind of study to expose false advertising | Wondering if I'm alone in this | I am rethinking Saturn
 "words": If it wasn't for the great service this would of been gone | Windows that would not go up or done front end replaced moon roof that leaks so bad we had over an inch of water inside | Transmission that won't shift right rear wiper would not stop | The ride is great but it's hard to find a comfotable driving position | The steering wheel blocks the MPH that should be swap for the tach | MPG is 15 22 city hwy | 
 "words": I replaced an '02 Impala with this | I love the ride and interior appointments | Sporty handling | Very comfortable on long road trips and tons of storage | I don't like the transmission MPG build quality | Everyone says the MPG is not what they expected based on the sticker and I'm no exception | The build quality is questionable because I had the thing in at least 10 times for piddly stuff | The worst however is the transmission | Short of a major reprogramming of the shift points and general responsiveness this transmission stinks badly- period | I fear however that if that is done MPG will suffer even more | It hunts in 6th and requires an act of God a slow one to downshift | 
 "words": I bought my 2007 Outlook as last year's model with only 50 miles on it | I love the looks of the SUV | The MPG isn't too bad for a big automobile and the room is great | 
 "words": We were looking for a family vehicle with 3-rows and narrowed it down to the Mazda CX-9 and Saturn | My wife won out and we got the Saturn and have loved it | Space was a major factor | We briefly had a CX-9 as a loaner recently and it seemed tiny in comparison | The mileage has been decent | 
 "words": Have had problems with the brake fluid leaking | On 3rd time taking it in they found a leak in the master cylinder | First they told me they must not have topped it off at the factory and they added fluid | Next they said it's hard to see the fill line so they added more fluid | Next they found the leak | There is something broken in the vent and I'm waiting for parts it's been 3 weeks | The middle right seat squeaks though they can't seem to duplicate it | The acceleration is sluggish especially on a hill | The automatic start is terrible | You may as well get in the vehicle you have to be so close for it to work | The gas mileage is very low | 
 "words": It is an adorable car | The coaco color is so cute | This is my most reliable car ever | I've had it for over a year no problems so far | Not even a little oil leak | I love it | 
 "words": Replaced our import suv thought we would give American another shot | This vehicle has it all | The third row seat room is awsome compared to our old vehicle Suzuki XL7 Limited | The captain chairs are great for the kids to jump quickly into the back | Smooth ride good looking inside and out | Get alot of heads turning | People cant believe the quality luxury in this Saturn | GM hit a home run with this platform | Got ours loaded except minus the NAV | 
 "words": The belt line is very high on this car and it is very difficult to see out the rear window | Overall the driver visability is poor | Gas mileage was not what was advertised | 
 "words": We bought our Saturn after looking at many 7 passenger CUV's | The Outlook had way more room and at least as good of gas mileage as any of them | Only the Acadia was close but it was at least 3000 more a similar model | We have had our Outlook for 6 months and have put on over 21000 miles with not one trip to the dealer | It has comfortably taken 6 adults or 3 adults and 4 kids on ski trips with all the associated gear | We have been very happy with everything | It has averaged almost 21 mpg since we bought it | I vowed never to own a dreaded mini-van but I am so tickled with the Outlook I don't even care if people ask if it is a type of van | 
 "words": I have owned mine for 10 months with 27284 miles | I use it for work and put on 600 or more highway 70 mph a week | The problem is that I have never got more than 21 mpg | I bought the front wheel drive for the 26 mpg | Wrong | It has been in to the dealership for seven things that were broken | The transmission got a free upgrade but shifts worse on hills or on ramps | I would suggest a different product than the outlook or Acadia from people I have talked to | I have two teacher friends with big families who thought the same as me | A nice vehicle that can fit a lot of kids and get good mpg | All of us agree city average is 13-15 mpg | HWY MPG 20-22 | not 26 | 
 "words": We purchased the Outlook XR AWD as a replacement for a Town Country minivan | The Saturn has been very reliable is extremely comfortable even for adults in the 3rd row and gets good mileage for its size | We're very happy with the purchase | 
 "words": I traded in my '03 Honda Pilot 4WD for a loaded '07 Outlook XR | Absolutely terrific vehicle so far | Design and build quality is top notch | Looks great | It will be the best car I've owned if it maintains the high reliability I've experienced with numerous Hondas and Toyotas | 
 "words": Was very excited about initial purchase and like most buyers noticed areas that can be improved upon | I expected fuel economy to be higher than 21 -still better than 17 18 with my 2005 Explorer | I'm having issues with slack in the drivers pwr seat and all 4 of the function buttons on the mid dash suffer from intermittent operation | The sound system is worst than my 2003 Focus I suspect the speakers are sub-standard | Overall I love the styling and comfort -especially the dual exhaust tips | Forgot to mention the service on the transmission after 2 months- leaking fluid due to a defective gasket | 
 "words": I did a great deal of research on this vehicle and it's competitors before we bought | The Saturn was the one that had the size we needed and the look we wanted | Finally I am driving a family car that I feel is meant for a young active and fun family | This car is comfortable durable gets great mileage for the size that it is and looks fantastic | I am a 1st time Saturn owner and I'd say I'll be a Saturn owner for life now | I am so glad that we chose the Saturn Outlook | 
 "words": My wife and I researched vehicles for months and finally decided on the Outlook | Since purchasing last July the vehicle has been in the shop 8 times | I didn't expect this for the amount that we paid | The list includes everything from a leaking sunroof to a series of rattles and vibrations throughout the vehicle to shorts in the electrical system | Given the choice to do it again we would not buy a Saturn | 
 "words": I have had 2 cars by Saturn and loved them both | I like everthing about this new 07 Outlook but the MPG is nothing liked advertized | My wife gets mad just getting in the car | Which makes it had to use | Perhaps I need more time | I only have 3000 miles | 
 "words": We absolutley love our Outlook | It is awesome in the snow and all around it has been a great vehicle for our family | We have had zero problems as long as we have owned it | We would recomend it to everyone | 
 "words": We bought the Outlook in November 2007 | A month prior to buying I had never heard anything about the car | We saw it and thought it looked very nice | Since we bought the 2007 we were able to get it fully loaded and got a very good deal | I never thought I would ever buy a fully loaded car and I am very happy with things that I thought were unnecessary like heated seats mirrors heated window washer fluid and the GPS | I'm not sure i want or need OnStar and I'm pleasantly surprised with XM radio I even renewed it for a year | Only thing I'm a little disapointed in is gas mileage is really at best 17mpg city | Its also a little difficult to park due to its size | 
 "words": I took a leap of faith and decided to purchase an Outlook in Jul 07 | Definitely a transmission problem with this vehicle | After I had the update transmission got worst | In Jan 08 I was driving along one day and I started to hear this loud noise coming from the back that sounded like an airplane | Took in for service they said that the wheel bearings had gone bad | On the day I had the wheel bearings replaced while I was driving home my steering wheel became really tight like it had no power steering took it back the pump in the steering wheel needed to be replaced | I have been in for service way too much | I haven't even had my first oil change | Heading to import dealer real soon | 
 "words": I was attracted to this vehicle because of its outward appearance | I test drove the Highlander the Pilot Toyota's RAV4and Mazda's CX9 before testing the Saturn so I could have some basis other than looks for my final decision | I saved the Saturn test drive for last | I was immediately impressed with the size relatively nimble handling ride and instrument cluster in the FWD XR that I drove | The transmission shifting seemed a little awkward | Downshifting for passing seemed to engage a bit later than I was used to but when it did happen the power was quite adequate | The Nav system gets more friendly with use | The White Diamond Tricoat looks great and I feel good driving this car | 
 "words": Got this car because we needed the room | 5 grandkids Came out of a Mercury Grand Marquis and have been really surprised at how much quieter and more comfortable this one is | We have made two extended trips so far and I am not impressed with the gas mileage getting 21 | 1 overall on both trips | Being a realist this is about what I would expect from a vehicle of this size | My problem with the mileage is it is too far off from the estimates for it to not be intentional in my opinion maybe to keep from scaring some people away | We have yet to find anything bad about the car | Take a serious look at this one if you need more than 5 seats
 "words": I looked at SUV's for over a year and then attended the Houston Auto Show | Looked at every SUV in the house and kept coming back to the new Outlook | A great choice | The gas mileage is as advertised and the overall styling is sharp | Most impressive is the interior room and styling | Only drawback I have found is the view out of the rear window is restricted when vehicles are close | 
 "words": This is a large very comfortable SUV | But we purchased this vehicle over competitors based on advertised fuel economy of 10 26 | Those number are a comlete lie our Saturn averages about 12 mpg in town and 17 mpg highway | If you need a truck this size its good but be warned you will get traditional SUV mileage don't believe GM's lies about its efficiency | 
 "words": I bought my Outlook in April because we were getting ready to have another baby and needed more room | I had a Nissan Altima | We test drove all of the competition and this was the one we wanted | Loved the advertised gas milage but that didn't quite happen we got about 21 | But we did get a KN filter on ebay and now we get a lot closer to the advertised gas around 25 | Love the style and drive after getting the update on the transmission it shifts great | It is a great first year model | The 3rd row could be a little easier to get into but is very nice when needed and love the space of folding down for a huge back space for cargo | All in all we really love our Outlook | 
 "words": Had a 2002 ford Explorer 6 cylinder | I feel this is a far better SUV | Getting better gas mileage with a much roomier car | And it has far better interior layout | The 3rd row seat is a dream to get into compared to other SUVs | I test drove I believe every car in this catagory | And found this to have the most practical layout inside | 
 "words": Fuel economy is good but lower than claimed | Visibility out of rear window is limited | Interior comfort is fine for driver | For the price of the options seating for both driver and passenber should offer power controls |
