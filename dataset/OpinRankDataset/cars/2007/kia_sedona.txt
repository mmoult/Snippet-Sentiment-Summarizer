 "words": My wife and I looked at almost every van on the market and for the money the Kia was by far the best performing best handling best riding van out of them all | The Sienna had a few options the Kia did not that we liked but it was not worth the extra money | We also have been averaging 18 MPG with the constant stop and go with the A C system running and I really like the torque the Kia has | Very happy with the purchase never thought I would go with a Korean made vehicle but they did it right on this one | 
 "words": The AC compressor has already been replaced once and the dealership and Kia know it's defective because of its coil | The noises inside the van are ridiculous when driving through uneven surfaces | When test driving make sure you take rough roads to drive on | Once the plastic coverings of the inside of the van are taken off the feel and interior noise increases dramatically | 
 "words": This is the first minivan I've really liked very well thought out | With 10K on the odometer we've had no problems | Recommend comparing the Sedona directly with an Odyssey EXL or Touring and you'll probably find the Sedona a much better buy in terms of included features safety warranty and most of all price | Built on the same assembly line the Sedona is basically a Hyundai Entourage with a simpler option package for a few thousand dollars less | Comfortable flip-forward middle seats make more sense than stow-and-go for us plus you get more ground clearance | Love the euro-styling 17 alloy wheels Michelin tires and sport shifter |

 "words": Was aiming for Toyota Sienna but got bogged down with extras I didn't want or ask for | Also liked Kia's five-year bumper-to-bumper warranty and ten-year power train warranty | I also liked saving 4000 over the Toyota Honda version | So far we have no complaints very satisfied | 
 "words": After comparing this to Honda Toyota and Dodge the Kia Sedona was a no-brainer | I find the styling of the Kia more attractive and SUV-like | The performance is outstanding for a minivan | The warranty was a big factor in our purchase decision but I believe the build quality is close to if not equal to Toyota and Honda | What sealed the deal though is that by far and away the Kia gives you the most for your money | 
 "words": We test drove an Odyssey Sienna and the Sedona and the Sedona is equal or better than the other 2 | We were very disappointed with the Sienna fit and finish | The Sedona is a excellent van with very good power comfort road manners and price the Sedona is not cheap as it used to be but this model is far superior than the older design | My gas mileage in the city is around 16 and 26 in the highway I am pleased with the fuel economy I know it will improve when the engine breaks in | We really enjoy driving this car my children love the comfort and the DVD | 
 "words": Purchased short wheel based version | Noticed that it suffers for fuel mileage but makes up for it in cargo and convenience | I travel and got rid of a 2003 Ford Taurus which got excellent mileage and had 140000 miles | But I am retired and needed the cargo capacity and leg room |

 "words": I compared ALL vans | It came down to the Honda and yes the Kia | Honda if you want to lease | Kia to buy | Though I preferred the Honda the 3k difference bang for the buck 10 year warranty a better reliability rating by Consumer Reports BEST minivan distinction in safety by the insurance institute 5 star gov | rating Best Buy by Consumers Digest and on and on from one review to the next | decision done | I did like the drive of the Honda but I believe it's because of the name cache Honda vs | Kia | Getting over that they drive near identical | The fit and finish is also on par if not better | Common sense value and the safest van distinction made this an easy purchase |
