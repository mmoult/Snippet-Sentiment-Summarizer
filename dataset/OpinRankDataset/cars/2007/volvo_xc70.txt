REVIEWS
 "words": After thinking about it for a long time I narrowed down my choice of cars to the XC70 Honda Element and Outback | Drove all 3 back to back | Bought the 2007 XC70 with 30k miles for a great price especially with a trade-in of my 16 year old Toyota 4-runner | I thought there was not comparison between the Volvo and the Outback | I know the Outback has a good reputation but the XC70 has blown me away imagine moving from a 1993 4-runner to a 2007 XC70 | It is such a joy to drive and although I can't compare it to other cars in its class I think it handles and rides incredibly | It is so solid and quiet and the interior is like sitting in your favorite leather chair | 
 "words": I leased this car in 10 2006 and purchased the additional service feature on it | The car has 26K miles on it and I need rotors brakes a new side view mirror alignment tires and horn | 1100 to repair a car that I put 4K down on and have been paying 470 month ever since | I'm really disappointed and will not get another Volvo | 
 "words": Had the worst experience with this car than any other car I have owned | After 35000 miles car broke down due to a fuel sensor | Had to wait for 3 hour in over 100 degree wather for Volvo's road side assistance | Had to drive 75 miles to pick up the car only to get almost home for it to break again | Now the back seat seatbelt is not working and have to go up to the dealership again | Paid to have tires rotated service did not do this | 35000 miles on the car and I need new tires | I do not drive cars hard and we always keep up with oil changes tire rotation etc | I am a working mom who has to do the school run | However I recently feel every time I get in the car there is a problem | 
 "words": 2nd Volvo XC 70 for us | Previous was 03 with better mileage 17 26 | City driving yields 13mpg highway never better than 22 | Also have had repeated problems with the tire pressure monitoring system car has been back 3x for service each time they tweak but warning message comes on after 30 minutes on highway | Never in short runs in city | Earlier they changed sensors told me to keep tyres infated to 43psi | Now they have changed some electronics-let's see | 
 "words": This is my second Volvo XC70 after the 2004 | The 2007 model is on the same chassis same engine but the miles per gallon are poor | I get less than 14 MPG in the city and about 19 MPG on the highway | I use premium gasoline and my driving pattern is the same as with the 2004 which got at least 22 on the highway and 17MPG in the city | The dealer has tried a few minor tweaks but won't really look into the problem and does not care | I think I bought a lemon as far as gas mileage is concerned | Other features on the wagon are good to great but with gas prices so high this is not a car to own | 
 "words": I have owned my Volvo XC 70 for one year | In this time I have come to really appreciate its engineering and design | It gives me excellent service and performance without any compromise | It handles beautifully in town and on the freeway | Its 5 cylinder motor with turbo gives me plenty of power when I need it | It has plenty of cargo space and its leather upholstery gives me the comfort I seek | I find it extremely comfortable to drive and its solid construction gives me a sense of security even when driving with heavy truck and SUV traffic | 
 "words": This vehicle is a great car and saved lives twice | It always loves to get up and go and has almost been like family | They should not have redesigned for 2008 | It has been through 2 5 car pile-ups and saved my 3 friends their lives | This car is truly amazing | I would recommend Volvo to anyone looking for a life-saving vehicle | The XC70 is a beautiful legend | 
 "words": I owned this wagon for about 9 months and made about 16000 miles | Had a few long trips 2000-4000 miles | I love this vehicle | It | s very reliable especially in complicated driving conditions | Well Volvo is known about this but this car is exceptional | I love to it on sharp bends especially on wet road | So far I could make anybody in this conditions feel absolutely safe | It took my wife quite a time to trust this car for she used to drive a family sedan | She simply could not believe that the car can do such things | I | ve tried to convince her to use it for me to be nor worried about her | The seats are excellent | I | ve some problems with low back but I can easily drive it | 
 "words": The car is smooth and responsive making for a great handling vehicle | It had surprising acceleration for a 5 cylinder | The leather seats are the most comfortable I have ever had in a car | On trips the longer I drive this car the more comfortable it gets | The cargo space is enormous | The interior is well laid out and with the leather package and wood trim very luxurious for a wagon | Best car we've ever had |

 "words": After researching cars for a year and a half we decided on the XC70 and have never looked back | This is by far the best car we've ever owned | Love it on long trips | The economy is much better than reported I average 21 city 27 hwy and there is always more than enough power even in the mountains | I have 26K miles on it already and not one issue yet |
