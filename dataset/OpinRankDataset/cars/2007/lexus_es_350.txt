REVIEWS
 "words": First Lexus | Great exterior look with sun and moon roof | Poor exterior paint quality and interior quality not what I expected for a Lexus | Tires did not last as expected | Overall few problems just a little disappointing | Nav of little use- maps not up to date and system not user friendly | 
 "words": My first Lexus | Very comfortable and quiet | Great fuel economy 23 31 for a large comfortable car | Quality design | Disappointed in the thin paint rock chips are very noticeable and the Michelin tires won't make 30000 | Large ugly mirrors to compensate for the thick roof supports | The wireless voice commands don't always do voice recognition | Expected more for 40K | 
 "words": I have owned several ES in the past but this is the first with GPS | I agree it is not up to par with the competition and I have been test driving many vehicles over the past couple of months | The voice command response is terrible and not worth the effort | Blue tooth has been fine | Biggest complaint is that GPS does not allow even a passenger to enter info while the car is in motion | Very frustrating as voice commands for navigation are not worth the effort | 
 "words": I bought this Lexus and was SO pleased | I got it as a certified pre owned | It is a great quality car | As usual Lexus and Toyota are ahead of the game | I strongly recommend this car | 
 "words": Pretty car | Great for long trips | Loud clicking in the engine until it warms | Taken to dealer several times and they report that it the noise is normal | However loaner cars do not make that noise | Car has several rattling noises and is poorly insulated from road noise | Poor thigh support | Poor rear vision | Love the keyless entry | Love the large trunk | 
 "words": This is the third Lexus overall and two in the family at once | One is an RX 350 for the mountains and snow days and the ES 350 is for everything else | The vehicle is all class | Easy on the wallet and good gas mileage | I tried the Acura and traded it in on the ES 350 after less than one year | The ES gives me the comfort and power I want in a vehicle | I have never been back to the dealership for anything but standard maintenance service with the RX or the ES and both are 07s | 
 "words": Definitely not a snow car | First real snow test | Very poor performance | Perhaps snow tires would make difference | 
 "words": This is not my first Lexus and the only problem is the car has developed squeaks and rattles sounds like the whole panel has a body flex when going over bumps | The whole panel behind and in roof sounds as if it is bending and making a terrible noise | It has been back to dealer and they have replaced seat and other parts still the same noise rattles vibrates when I turn | I have stopped using the car 7000 km in the last year used to be over 20000 km | Great performance | I have only used premium and it returns great gas mileage | It takes several tries for the voice-recognition system to work | I will most likely go back to Infiniti | 
 "words": Owned a Benz Cadi Allante Buick too many to mention including a Subaru and this car is built looks great and has not given me any problems whatsoever | The fuel economy while taking premium runs circles around most cars | 33 on the open road average around town over 22 | I am not sure I would even think of trading it in on anything else | 
 "words": Was more interested in buying the Benz E350 but with a starting price tag of 52K i decided to check out the ES 350 after a friend had let me drive one | It was instant love and the rest is history | My car is not a little over 1 year old and I still love it like the day I drove of the lot | More than enough power to pass on the beltway and comfort like no other car for those long trips | Got the upgraded model with the Panorama roof and Mark Levinson system well getting me out of this car is hard believe that | 
 "words": I'm very comfortable in my ES 350 | Smooth quiet ride | Nav system is great | Sound system is pretty good but could be better | Love my back up camera | Only complaint is that I can't seem to get climate controls to a perfect temp for me but LOVED the air conditioned seats this summer keeps you from sticking to leather ladies | This is my second ES and I'd recommend it for someone who wants luxury but can't afford or doesn't want to spend the extra for a better Mercedes or BMW | My husband has complained about the voice recognition but it's just operator error | Overall I love it | Got a great color too Amber Pearl and people compliment it all the time | 
 "words": I agree with a writer's assessment about noises poor highway handling and the so-so radio | The important problem is the highway handling | At 60 to 65 mph and above the car seems to have a wobble and the steering wheel actually shakes | I am still working with a dealer to fix this | From day 3 of owning the car I have had noises creaks rattles whatever inside | Most of the dashboard noise has been fixed now but other noises are coming from pillars or doors | I drive a lot so the problems are very disappointing | 
 "words": A smooth comfortable ride without sacrificing too much in the way of handling | Coming from a BMW convertible I miss the sharp cornering but I love the smooth quiet ride | Much better on the freeway | The premium stereo is all anyone needs | Plays mp3 disks so with 6 disks you can load about 1000 songs at one time | Nav system works like a charm |

 "words": I've had my ES 350 since 08 06 | I picked the Ultra package with every available option including the radar crash protection | It was worth the extra expense | The higher end leather is the plushest | The custom wheels add an extra dazzle | The ride is firm and compliant not the best on corners | I couldn't be happier | My only complaints are 1 I wanted the Sirius option and as of now my dealer says that it isn't available but likely will be in the near future | 2 The touch button controls on the nav | system phone system are mostly dimmed out unworkable when the car is in motion | Very annoying and inconvenient | 3 The bluetooth phone system has a tunnel sound |

 "words": I drive a Mercedes E350 wagon this is my wife's car but I love taking it for a spin once a week | It gets 30 mpg which is definitely more than my Benz | Also it is slightly quicker with a zero to sixty run of 7 | 0 sec | Also many options silky smooth leather and a very nice console display | Half the price of my Mercedes wagon yet looks just as luxurious | Very hard to believe this car is based off a Camry | 
 "words": Very smooth transmission | Great quiet ride | Great radio and sound | I expected more than cardboard on door panels | Flimsy glove compartment door trunk lid | Not enough front seat thigh support | Navigation system a colossal disappointment | It is practically useless outside major metro areas | Pretty picture though | No way to open trunk if power lost | Fold down rear seatbacks with full access to trunk would be great | Front end too low scrapes most curbs | Fatter tires would give even smoother ride | Roof line too low for tall people | Does not come with body side moldings door sides are naked to damage | Support has been minimal from Lexus headquarters and dealership | 
 "words": Bought the ES 2 weeks ago | Today was the 3rd time it went back to dealer | Lots of rattles from front passenger door front deck stereo area rear deck seat belt | I was driving their loaner ES 350 | That car has nearly same rattles as mine | Rattling is the problem you can't find during test drive | After you take the car if there's a rattle you need to locate a more precise spot so that it may be easier for their technicians to find and fix | Really doubt about Lexus's quality | Others than rattling I enjoy my ES very much | Fast and comfortable | 
 "words": The ES 350 has met or exceeded my every expectation | It is comfortable safe and sedate | It is equipped with every feature that I think a luxury car should have | 
 "words": Overall it is pretty much what I expected from Lexus except the finicky transmission | It is quiet and despite what the competition thinks of its looks it gets plenty of second looks | it's black with darkened windows and the spoked rims | It is often mistaken for the much more expensive LS by the uninformed including my boss and co-workers who ask are we paying you too much | and how did you afford that | If only the transmission would settle on a gear and not want to jolt my bad back when in stop-and-go traffic or even the slightest incline I would give it a strong 9 | Had to have a new transmission put in at 5000 miles new transmission only slightly better | 
 "words": All 2007 Lexus vehicles are set to disable the navigation and phone dialing while the car is in motion | This is a huge pain | The otherwise very good Lexus quality is overshadowed by the loss of the override that was present in older Lexus vehicles | I would have bought an Acura Audi or BMW anything actually if I had known the nav was disabled |

 "words": Getting real good gas mileage 26 MPG in town 36 MPG on the highway | I have nitro in my tires and a KN air filter | Both of these really help | 
 "words": Compared all mid sized luxury and kept coming back to ES 350 | Considered A6 also | Power and economy are surprisingly great | Really glad I got the nav | 
 "words": This is the most competent non-sports sedan I've ever driven | Very powerful engine although you could eat breakfast while it selects its gear in automatic mode great comfort and amazing integration of electronics GPS climate audio etc | Really a beautiful vehicle | I have a big complaint though about the GPS system | You cannot set destinations or use many of the features while the car is in motion | This is billed as a safety feature but it's a terrible inconvenience especially when a passenger is sitting next to the driver | In summary it doesn't have the soul of my 528 but it's a great compromise when looking for a classy ride with great power at a great price | 
 "words": I just finished a trip to and from Canada of about 1600 miles | Most of the driving was on good roads in hilly and mountainous country | On regular gas I averaged almost 35 mpg at an average speed of 67 mph | The car's mileage calculator said 34 | 7 mpg | My calculator said 37 | 9 mpg | The ES 350 is not a formula one car but it is supremely comfortable handles well for a sedan and has sufficient power to do what needs to be done | 
 "words": I'm definitely enjoying the 2007 model which is my second Lexus | It's better than my old 2004 model | Got it with the premium pkg | It has lots of toys | It's also fun to drive | I like the fact that is looks more sporty | But at the same time it has a elegant look to it as well | The cabin is also quiet |

 "words": We have 905 miles on the odometer but there are a few problems with it | The homelink refuses to connect with our garage door system | The rear view mirrors tilt down in reverse like they're supposed to but they don't come back up | I'm sure these problems are nothing that the dealer can't fix but with a car in this price range you'll expect something better | Size was the issue for us so we looked at the Audi A6 BMW 530xi the Mercedes E350 4Matic the Infiniti M35x and even the Lexus GS350 awd | The ES has the best value and has the best ride for the price even though the handling can't beat some but it's expected | 
 "words": Car is quiet powerful and luxurious | I am actually getting about 35 mpg on the highway | I look forward to the drive home finally | 
 "words": I enjoy the car | As four door sedans go it is a sweetheart | It is very comfortable infinitely adjustable and quiet | I got all the bells and whistles Levinson sound system nav rotating headlights Xenon bulbs heated and cooled seats etc | It actually has good acceleration and handles very well for a four door sedan | It gives plenty of warning before you get in over your head | It decidedly is NOT my Daytona Coupe but only cost half as much and it gets 31 mpg on the road the Daytona gets 22 but has 600 hp | 
 "words": This is my first Lexus and now I understand | Beautiful car with a great balance of upscale comfort technology and power performance | In only a few days worth of mixed driving I'm averaging 26 | 5 mpg | The Mark Levinson DVD nav system is incomparable and the Bluetooth system works great | It plays telephone sound out of driver's front speaker on the dash with microphone near the rear view mirror | People don't know you're on a speakerphone | Plenty of room for 4 adults possibly 5 | Like the backup camera front and rear backup sensors and the keyless entry and push button start | 
 "words": My experience with this car so far has been good except for the ventilated seats driver and passenger which are agonizingly uncomfortable | The lumbar support digs into your back and cannot be adjusted sufficiently to correct the problem | I tried to get the company to deal with this but they said it could not be fixed and they blew me off | I sat in other models to compare seats | The nonventilated seats are more comfortable but none of them compares favorably to the sports model | 
 "words": I have had this car 10 months with 11000 miles currently and have read all reviews | I agree with jerky transmission when below freezing otherwise OK and you get used to the transmission | Be careful when coming to the first couple of stop lights because it will jerk | No mechanical issues but dashboard has this creaking noise every time I hit a bump | If you turn up radio you don't hear it but I don't always want to listen to the radio that loud | I have taken it to dealership twice and very helpful but no solution | They said something about rubber stoppers that are between glass and dashboard | Surely this will be a recall on the initial builds | 
 "words": Overall the car is great with a beautiful interior and a smooth ride | There are two annoying design flaws that I am sure Lexus will fix in the upcoming 2008 model | The LED lighting is ridiculously dim what were they thinking | Second the latch to open the center console is exactly where your elbow goes causing it to open constantly | It is also a strange design that limits your ability to use it | They should also make the car interior a little bit bigger an inch more headroom in the frony an inch each more hip shoulder and leg room in the rear | Then it would be closer to perfect | It is better than all its competition except maybe the BMW 5 Series which is about 15K more | 
 "words": Leased this car last december | Very good car | Had several cars before getting the ES again and it still is at the top of its class | Even though we had a problem with the A C where the air was coming out hot even though it was at 60 degrees Lexus fixed it with no problem |

 "words": I did a lot of research on this vehicle before buying and driving and it has lived up to the Lexus reputation and more | I did seriously consider the Toyota Avalon and found I could buy the ES 350 and get more amenities for less money than the Avalon came fully loaded | For space and comfort that I was looking for the only other car that came close was the Infinity and it was more out of my price range | I hear a lot of sour grapes rap out there about Toyota products but they are still the most reliable and top quality large automotive manufacturer in the world today | 
 "words": We purchased the car in Dec 2006 and I have put about 2500 miles on the car we love everything about it | It rides great and the only slight problem we have is it is a little noisy when it is not warmed up | We get a lot of compliments on the looks of the car | This is our first Lexus after owning a Mercedes-Benz truck and an Explorer truck | The quality is much better in the lexus I would definitely recommend this car

 "words": I have been very satisfied with the Lexus ES 350 I have been driving for the last 10 months | I live in the coastal plain of North Carolina and drive 90 of the time on flatland | If I drove in an area with hills or mountains I don't think I would be as satisfied with the ES 350 driving experience because the transmission seems to get confused in hilly terrain | But I have been very satisfied overall with the ES 350 |

 "words": I purchased my ES 350 in late December of 2006 after driving a Chevy SUV for the past 4 years | What a difference | I have loved every minute of driving this car | I haven't experienced any of the road noise problems that I have read about on this site but have had some issues with the transmission missing between 3rd and 4th gear | I spoke with the dealership about this and was told that it is a computer problem that they are aware of that will be fixed as soon as the program is made available to the dealerships | This is my first Lexus and I must say I'm very impressed with the quality and attention to detail that went into this car especially for the price | 
 "words": The ride is so smooth it feels like the car is gliding on air | But hit the brake and you will see how well grounded the car is as it stops in a heart beat | Optional packages are great | I have little kids and wouldn't have even considered a car without side airbag | The chrome wheels match perfectly with the door handles and are not too flashy to ruin the conservative classic style of Lexus | I can not wait until the 2008 model come out | We will be buying hopefully newly designed RX 350 |

 "words": The styling of the car quality of materials are Lexus expectations | What is disappointing is the need for a new transmission within 1500 miles of new along with valve noise when cold starting | The mechanical problems are outweighing the benefits with this car | The interior is beautiful Mark Levinson sound system is the best out there | If only Lexus Toyota researched the build quality before debuting the car early |
