 "words": Purcheased an 07 AWD with 24K miles from an individual next day the engine light was on | My auto tech son put on scanner and in 5 min said it had a bad catalytic converter | Vehicle still under warranty so took it to a dealer in Denver area next day | Their highly trained techs took two and a half hrs and diagnosed catalytic converter needed replaced | Ordered parts and need to go back to fix | sometime | Dealer rep had a real unpleasant attitude | Only experienced this once before also with a GM product 03 Pontiac | Swore I would never buy another GM product | should have learned my lesson previouly and stayed away from GM related items also | Will I ever learn |

 "words": My previous post Disappointed on 08 14 2007 describes our early issues | Since then catalytic convert changed in shop 3-4 times because of engine shutting off in traffic engine light on sporadically engine stumbles sporadically fuel gauge acting up passenger dashboard airbag panel cracking | Everything in this vehicle is controlled by the computer fuel timing transmission etc | I have asked the dealer several times to please replace it | They Will not replace one unless a catastrophic failure occurs | Overall hatred for this vehicle and frustration of trying to get it fixed has made ownership of another Suzuki product impossible | 
 "words": We were naive when we purchased the Suzuki | We liked the power and style | Then just months later with 7000 miles things started to go wrong | It started rattling the suspension dilapidated the car's computer died the power steering died | Now in September 2009 it has 66000 miles and looks and drives like its 20 years old | Now it is only worth 6500 and we have become upside down on the car | Overall I think this is the worst car in the world | 
 "words": I purchased my XL7 with approx 70 miles on it | First couple of months it was back at the dealers for repairs spent more time there than with me | Then going over a bridge and it sounded like a gun went off in the cab | The airbag on the passenger side went through the 1st stage of deployment in the dashboard | Took it in no codes registered | However they did replaced the airbag and the dashboard | Now here it is a few months later and it happened again | Same side | first stage of deployment no codes but now Suzuki is saying | sorry no codes | it didn't happen | I have the perforation mark in the dashboard from deployment | Everything is the same as the first time |

 "words": Attracted first by looks then acceleraton then sound system then fit | 2wd w traction control | Car has a tendency to wander almost as if each wheel at times has a different amount of power than the other | We drive it but not as often as we would like because | Dealer has no explanation | Seems better without traction control | Wouldn't buy another one if it had a hint of this behavior | Love my 92 Jeep and 95 Subuaru | Suzuki looks good in the driveway |

 "words": I bought this XL7 brand new in August of 2007 it was back at the dealership on December for a loud noise coming from the front suspension whenever I turned or passed on a bump | It was there for about a month until finally they figured out what was wrong and fixed it | Now about 3 weeks ago the same noise came back but guess what | The local dealership closed and now I have to drive about 4 hrs | to the nearest dealership because Suzuki wont allow me to take it anywhere else here locally | Stay away from SUZUKI their customer service is horrible they talk to you in a very unprofessional manner and when you have a problem you are basically stuck with it | American cars are better | 
 "words": well going on 2 yrs and this has been a very good car for us comfy on long trips to Montana from seattle and was even getting 27 mpg on that trip | Generally getting 19 around town | It has a large gas tank compared to most SUVs in its class even though I honestly wish it was a 20 gallon tank | HUGE cargo capacity for this class of suv you can really load it up | It's not top notch but we only paid 19 grand for it Got around great in 6 inch snow and just cable chains on the front tires | We looked at trading it in but after looking at all the other SUVs the fuel economy and the cost of those SUVs we decided to just keep it | Unfortunately this car really lost a lot of its value |

 "words": If you are stuck with one of these be aware it has no value in a year's time | Terrible turning range cramped cabin very uncomfortable seats they're too short for your legs makes long trips tiring | We have 2 children and the 3rd row seat really is a waste because you need that room for storage | The dash quality is cheaply made and started puckering after 6 months | After 2 days of this vehicle we knew we'd made a mistake | 
 "words": Solid comfortable ride city and highway | City gas mileage could be better | We average about 14 but that's at 25 to 35 mph and a lot of traffic lights | Drove from Louisville to Miami fully loaded and got around 23 to 24 at 75 to 80 mph | You can haul a lot of stuff in it | Small back window creates an adventure at times backing up | Vehicle is very peppy and the blizzard we had last winter did not phase the all wheel drive | The only problem so far was a brake light went out but the dealer replaced at no charge
 "words": Just after 1000 miles the gear shifter wouldn't shift into drive | it would pop out and shift into neutral | RCA Jack broke not even 200 miles later | then the Radio went at 4000 miles it played when it wanted too | Then at 5000 miles the entertainment center went | at 5500 the blinkers went | at 25000 miles my leather is TERRIBLE | not good quality | Rarely have people in the car and it's ripped apart | WARNING

 "words": We purchased our XL7 after reading and researching all the midsize SUV's | The honeymoon was over about 3000 miles into it | We have had to take it back to the dealership 3 or 4 times because the motor mount kept causing problems with the ignition and thumping and knocking noises from the bottom | We also had trouble with a clicking sound in the odometer area | They told us at the dealership that it would resolve itself | not | Love the look of the car and would be 100 satisfied if we hadn't had to keep going back for repairs the same thing each time Seems like Suzuki didn't work out all the kinks on the 2007 XL7 | We probably won't buy another but what do you do | We'll keep it for now | 
 "words": I love the steering response but haven't enjoyed the lack of steering range | Takes a lot of room to turn love the seat warmers do not like the lack of visibility and do not like the location of the window buttons | But overall I feel really good in the vehicle feel safe feel comfortable | Was torn between the Berry and Gold got the gold and think I would have liked the Berry better now |

 "words": LOVE IT | I'm very picky with my cars and love german cars don't like japanese cars cause they feel flimsy | I'm very wrong can't believe the XL7 it's wonderful can't think of anything other than why is it not as famous as the others in its class they need to do some more advertising this is a great car that people should know about | It's a joy to drive looks fantastic with the peace of mind of 100000 miles | Suzuki has come a long way from the 80s and 90s | Just try it you'll love it | 
 "words": We love our XL7 2007 | Suzuki got the vehicle spot on | We looked at the GMC Acadia and the Saturn Outlook and saved several thousand dollars for the same vehicle | Couldn't be happier | It runs great has plenty of room and looks good |

 "words": We bought an XL7 luxury package with a sunroof and 3rd row and we LOVE it | Two days after we bought it we we made a 6 or 7 hour trip to Virginia and the car performed great we figured gas mileage wouldn't be too good since the car wasn't broken in but it got 23 mpg and was comfortable on the trip with size and style and features and great price and warranty I have no idea why these aren't more popular we are very pleased and look forward to many miles with our XL7 | If you are considering Pilot Highlander or the like you should really shop at Suzuki as well | 
 "words": I've had this car for more than 6 months and am completely satisfied with it | It is roomy powerful and fun to drive | Handles very easily | it's very fast | Great cargo space when 3rd row is folded | I am looking forward to testing the trailer hitch because one of reasons to buy this car was 3500 lb trailer towing ability | We had couple very long trips in it and I can say this car is very comfortable | For example my wife and I drove from Grand Rapids MI to Niagara Falls NY | It took us about 12 hours to get there and in the end of the day we still had a lot of energy to walk around and enjoy the Niagara Falls | I feel very confident when I drive this car in any season |

 "words": I shopped drove and pretty much evaluated every mid size SUV under 30k MSRP I could get my hands on over a 2 day period | After sitting down and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each vehicle the XL7 came away the winner | The ride is smooth it has good throttle response steering and handling are impressive | I took it up into the mountains and had a ball with the manumatic shifter | Things like leather heated power seats power sunroof AWD Auto Temp Controls etc | were out of reach cost wise in other vehicles were within our budget with the XL7 | Smooth sporty body lines and a price in the low 20s sealed the deal for us | A 7yr-100k warranty this one is a no brainer |

 "words": The day after we brought it home we noticed fluid spots in the driveway | Under 3000 miles and the seals in the transfer case had to be replaced | The vehicle seems different now | At first we thought that we were experiencing road feedback because the vehicle feels like it's surging ever so slightly | But while on a smooth road recently it felt like the transmission stumbled a couples times and then caught again because it pushed me back into the seat when it occured and it felt like a hard thunk | The vehicle is going back to the dealer for a look see but I doubt that they find anything | I also noticed today that a bolts holding the drivers door stop on are working themselves out | I want out | 
 "words": In 34 years operating my own auto repair facility I have not seen such value in a vehicle before | The GM 3 | 6LY7 engine in the XL7 is awesome | Aluminum block forged steel crankshaft dual overhead cams 4 valves per cylinder variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust roller finger rocker arms piston cooling oil jets to cool the engine with no coolant for up to 50 miles steel timing chains not belts | True dual exhausts | A 5 speed Aisin AF-33 direct drive cool operating transmission and Toyota T4 fluid | Loaded quiet and comfortable well below 30K | Drive one |

 "words": It took me lots of reading and thought to choose but when all was said and done I am happy we bought this new XL7 | My wife still has the older version which has proven to be extremely reliable and worth its own | The new one side by side shows a complete redesign | We have all the added safety features and third row all worthwhile and our children are fascinated with the DVD it even comes with wireless headphones | Driving is fun the leather interior is a big plus and the seat is wider than the old version | Seat belts are all 3 point and it has 8 airbags 6 side 2 front | The AWD and the automatic stability control do not affect the joy of driving it but it feels different than our old one | 
 "words": I really enjoy this vehicle | It's roomy handles nicely and is unique and stylish | I feel like I bought a luxury car without the luxury price | Mine is the base model and does not have the 3rd row of seats so I have loads of cargo room which is great for groceries and the kid's sports gear or whatever else I need to haul | It rides very nice getting in and out is easy because it's not that high off the ground but it's not too low either | But when you're driving it you feel like it's up a little higher than a car mostly because of the adjustable seat | I'm short so I have it the whole way up | All in all the more I drive it the more I love it | 
 "words": This is a excellent vehicle inside and out | The engine is phenomenal and it drives like a luxury sedan | Loaded up six adults 2 over 6' tall w child seat with ease | Suzuki really hit this nail on the head | 
 "words": The Suzuki XL7 is a fun crossover SUV to drive both on the interstate and in the mountains | Areas of future improvement should be the brakes which require a significant amount of pressure and rear view visibility is limited | Fuel economy on the highways has been fair at 24 mpg | After 3500 miles not a single problem | Good value for the money | If you do your own oil changes it is no fun to get the oil filter off since it is easier to take out an appendix | 
 "words": I really like this SUV | VERY SAFE | Many safety features and strong crash test rating | One of the best warranty programs available | I upgraded from a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo which I never had problem with to the 2007 XL7 | I love the interior very comfortable drive | 
 "words": A crossover for everyone in the family | For dad a sporty powerful suv | For mom versatility and room of a minivan | For the kids style with dvd gaming input | For elderly parent easy of entry and exit ladder not needed | We bought the limited w dvd and everyone just loves it and after 12 years in a minivan that's a lot for a crossover | If you are looking for a crossover or minivan don't overlook the suzuki XL7 '07 | Fit and finish was great on ours 2 months and 3 thousand miles 19 | 2 mpg | 
 "words": I became a Suzuki fanatic when I bought my '06 Aerio | It's little but has a powerful engine | Now my wife drives a brand new XL-7 | It is roomy handles like a fancy sedan responds excellently and there's no way it compares to the Equinox | I tested both the XL-7 has European window switches a charger 4 manual speed and most importantly my whole crew 3 kids grandma and grandpa fit comfortably in it | My salesperson provided outstanding customer service | I paid under 23000 for it | We are very happy with it | We can't wait for the summer and drive it up to Yosemite | It | s too fancy for off road driving | 
 "words": I did a thorough comparison of vehicles when shopping | The XL-7 compares very well for the price with other vehicles in its class | The trim level I selected includes a DOHC 252HP V6 engine with DVD Sat radio leather and 7 passenger seating | It is hard to find all this for the price that I paid in any other make model | this truck is very fun to drive and looks great too | 
 "words": After sliding off the freeway in my 2004 XL-7 during a bad winter storm and then rolling and totaling it I knew I wanted my replacement to still seat 7 but have front all wheel drive instead and side curtain airbags for all 3 rows | Low and behold I bought the 2007 model | It is much improved over the old version | I LOVE this car | I've had it two months and have had opportunity to drive it on snow and ice | It handles amazingly well in adverse conditions | My gas mileage has been steadily climbing and at 2000 miles it is already at 20 mpg | The one downside the stereo DVD system stopped working and had to be replaced | 
 "words": The XL-7 is a good vehicle for the money | It offers a touch of class without spending 1000s more | You do not have an option of things like high intensity headlights or a backup camera but it has a good list of toys | I wish it had better leather and less engine noise | 
 "words": This is one outstanding stylish SUV | The value for the price is incomparable | The Suzuki dealership in was a very nice and professional experience | I did most of the legwork over the Internet including the 1 | 9 financing application and approval process | This was a no hassle experience in and out in under two hours | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle for my wife but I have driven it considerably | We needed 3rd row seating and compared it with the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot | We thought the ride was comparable to the Pilot but the features price and appearance were more attractive | We love it | It accelerates well has a smooth engine and considering its relatively small size it is surprisingly comfortable for the 2nd and 3rd row passengers | 
 "words": The XL-7's driving comfort and ride are great | Its styling especially the headlights is unique and bold | I already have 4000 miles and have never encountered any problem | In terms of safety this SUV is deemed excellent as it is equipped with all available safety features | The engine is very powerful with 253 hp coupled with variable valve timing thus passing is very quick | I purchased this car simply because of the engine styling and most importantly the affordable price |

 "words": I love the XL-7 | I was the first one in the country to own a new one | I crashed my old 2003 XL-7 | I went looking for a new vehicle and could not find anything as big with all the features for under 30000 | I purchased the luxury model | It has three rows of seats side airbags all wheel drive leather heated front seats and a DVD system for the kids | The DVD system plays MP3's that's over 1000 songs per DVD | Also it's a dual mode system | That means that the kids can watch a movie and I can listen to my radio | This truck's cons include the lack of heated mirrors | My 2003 XL-7 had them and the Grand Vitara has them | This is a nice feature when driving | Also it has no Sirius radio factory system has XM and no converter | The only saving grace is a front auxiliary input | 
 "words": We tested more than five SUVs with third row seats and we found that the Suzuki XL-7 provides the best value | It has a long list of standard features | Suzuki did not do a great job to advertising the XL-7 | Some features were not even listed in their specifications | Many web sites have the wrong information too | For example the driver seat is 6-way power instead of 4-way power | It has reading lights for the second row not just the front row etc | Our local dealer is very nice and they have no-hassle pricing which is far below invoice | I noticed small paint problem inside of the front window frame this morning | But overall the vehicle seems to be very well made | And I do not notice any cheap materials | 
 "words": Coming from the 2004 the current model is vastly superior in ride comfort dimensions power 252 hp | and technology features | Suzuki really went all out with the gadgets remote start | navigation | power seats | quality leather materials | chrome wheels | even tossed in the free vehicle alarm and XM satellite radio | Compared to a similarly equipped Murano the XL-7 is approx 10000 less | This is an extremely safe vehicle with side curtain airbags in all 3 rows | Suzuki really got it right with the new XL-7 | 
 "words": This SUV was bought by my wife mostly by mistake s she was interested in the Grand Vitara and was talked into this piece of junk | It is without a doubt the worst vehicle I have ever owned or driven | Suzuki has some really great vehicles that they design and build such as the Grand Vitara and new SX4 | This ain't one of them | We sold it at a loss a month after we bought it | The previous evaluation was undoubtedly written by a dealer employee or salesman | Rating it a 10 | Give me a break | It gets lousy gas mileage and has a noisy thrashy engine | Its fit and finish are the worst I've ever seen mismatched plastic flimsy trim falling off in your hand | This is a thinly disguised Chevy Equinox which is rated very low | 
 "words": This truck is responsive and agile | It's also comfortable and well equipped | It is a lot of vehicle for the money | 
 "words": This car seems very well made | It handles extremely well | It is extremely comfortable | We have only had it for five days but it has been pure enjoyment | I want to live in it | 
 "words": We have a 2006 Grand Vitara and love it | We had a smaller car that just didn't seem very safe so we decided to spring for a second SUV with a third row of seating | We looked at Durangos Chrysler Pacificas etc | Nothing seemed as luxurious and spacious and priced right with high gas mileage as the 2007 XL-7 | When I drove the XL-7 vs | the other vehicles the visibility and control I had were awesome | With two children and a dog this vehicle was the best purchase we have ever made |
