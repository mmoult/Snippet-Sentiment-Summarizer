REVIEWS

 "words": We love our Aspen it handles well and the bells and whistles are awesome | We haven't had any malfunctions to speak of although my husband has noticed something strange at the pumps he often fills up when the needle is on E and as he fills the tank he expects the gallons on the pump to match what he knows the tank should hold the numbers come close to matching | It's as if there's a few unrecorded gallons left in his tank but it's a significant amt | The dealer has checked it out too and no one can explain it | It's weird | Our one complaint the rear seats are FIXED | They cannot be slid forward or backward by the occupant to accommodate a tall driver or someone in the 3rd row | 
 "words": Just bought this car used | It drives just like a car | I have never owned an SUV but could not resist this one | It looks like any other luxury SUV without the price | We got ours for a steal at 22k | Loaded with DVD and great stereo | Has plenty of room for my two kids and all there stuff | 
 "words": Bought this as a left-over new 2007 after looking at a Pacifica and glad that this is what I chose | Highway miles with the 5 | 7 Hemi are between 21 and 23 MPG | Keeping the tach under 2000 rpm helps a lot | Towing is no problem recently towed a 6 x 12 U-Haul trailer loaded and still got 14 mpg | Towing a boat is like it isn't there | Comfort is great the ride and handling are excellent | Fit and finish are excellent | Even with gas going through the roof I don't see me trading down | 
 "words": We bought a used 07 All options Hemi Nav Remote Start everything | I bought it in Atlanta GA I live in Roanoke VA | Trip home was good | 455 miles and got 21 | 2 mpg on the Hemi MDS engine | No complaints on gas | A vehicle this size | That | s good | It could have been better I suppose but I was on and off the gas since I had a new toy | It has a smooth ride very quiet | The Hemi climbs the mountains effortlessly | I was going 80 mph up the mountains at only 2000 rpm | It gets a lot of looks | The 20 | chromes really set it off | The third row seat access is by far the easiest out there | The lever on the second row seat is so simple | Get the Hemi with MDS | No use for the Flex fuel No 85oc here | 
 "words": One of these loaded is as nice as any luxury SUV on the market and costs thousands less | Great buy and have never been happier with a vehicle | 
 "words": This is a great SUV | My first was a Ford Explorer | I loved it | However when switching between the two for the past 9 months showed me what a great ride the Aspen is | Very smooth | Didn't buy it for the mpg | But it isn't very good | IF you drive really slow even on highway 20 mpg is best | If you have hills wind to pass etc the mpg drops to 16 quick | 
 "words": Got a great deal through warehouse club | Feel as though I have a vehicle as good or better looking than the majority of the SUVs only I paid much less | I get comments all the time on how nice the SUV looks | Roomy enough to haul just about anything and very comfortably seats people even in the third row | 
 "words": This is an excellent SUV for the Price | The limited has all the features other similar SUVs have at a lower cost | Unfortunately the vehicle has been in the service department 4 times because the engine malfunction light comes on and causes the vehicle to have drivability issues | I have been to 2 different dealerships and nobody can find the cause of the issue which has caused a serious safety issue | Be cautious about buying this new model
 "words": Got the Hemi MDS | We love this vehicle | Does everything expected well | Drives handles hauls | no complaints other than the gas mileage | But what large SUV gets good gas mileage | Very happy with this buy | 
 "words": It rides like a dream handles very well and has all the power with a KN air charger- power all the more | Bottom line it's comfy stylish responsive quick and only costs around 32K as we all know you can't get an Acura for that as if I'd want one after this gem | If you pass this up go back to Uranus or whatever other planet that is in the deep cold of overcharging for the same vehicle that is everywhere just slightly Emblemed | I love it | 
 "words": This SUV is fanatastic | I had an Expedition for a little while a couple of years ago but quickly traded it in because it felt and drove like a truck | The Aspen is a dream | I traded in my Pacifica which I loved for a little more room | Initially I was worried about the ride but that was needless | It drives and feels like a car | 
 "words": Certainly fun to drive with an excellent ride | Feels like a heavier vehicle with tremendous power Hemi | 18 inch wheels offer nice handling and smooth ride | Lots of compliments on looks | Installed satellite Sirius at dealer | 700 compared to 185 from factory | so get it from factory if can | At 6' 3 the door entry is small and seat is not wide for large behind | UConnect is awesome | Rear storage is small with 3rd row up | The lack of dual zone driver passenger climate control is strange for vehicle that lists for 42500 | same comment for satellite | Interior is attractive but leather is stiff | The small glove box on dash is annoying | center console is deep but awkward to access | 
 "words": This started out as a vehicle for the wife and kids but I find myself behind the wheel more more | Great look feel and handling for the price | Even the base model demands respect | 
 "words": Wow I am still having fun driving this beast after one year | I own a 5 | 7 hemi limited all equipped except for the NAV | I believed that all reviews are pretty accurate | However I will comment on Canadian winter driving with lot of snows freezing rains icy conditions the driving is OK with the 20' tires but would strongly recommend winter tires but hard to find | This is my 1st year with winter tires and nothing can stop me | The 4 wheel drives is extremely precise and can not feel anything when all wheels are slipping | My wife kids and I feel extremely safe in the vehicle | 
 "words": To set the record straight I own a 5 | 7 HEMI Limited | I've driven most all the SUV's in its class and this one feels the lightest due to its power | The fit-and-finish comments I am reading just aren't true | the Chrysler interioir is on par with what you will find on the market | The fold-up second row seats are the easiest to use for my small wife | use one hand and 2 clicks | My Jeep Commander in contrast is much harder | Styling is hit or miss but everyone looks at it and asks us about it because they have never seen one before and they all comment on how pretty it is | Bottomline is that it hauls hauls all 4 of my daughters wife loves the bells whistles | great buy | 
 "words": My wife and I just bought the Aspen | This thing rocks | We got the HEMI DVD NAV leather heated seats and so on | We bought this as a lease return and noticed the fuel is a little poor but it is a big suv with lots of power | Everyone who has seen it has loved the interior and the exterior as well | Mention it has a HEMI and they say wow | The gas mileage is about 16 mpg in rush hour traffic not to bad | 
 "words": This SUV is the bomb | I get compliment after compliment on it | It's loaded and I feel rich driving it | It came with a lifetime powertrain warranty however I purchased the extended bumper to bumper warranty which is lifetime as well | Yes I said lifetime bumber to bumper | What can I say I have had past problems with American made vehicles | Although I doubt it will give me as many problems as my Chevy Trailblazer and Buick Rendezvous | That Hemi just hums | You will be noticed and you can't beat the price-period | 
 "words": This is my second Hemi 1st was Dodge RAM truck which I also loved and my 1st SUV | The Aspen is a total headturner | I constantly get asked about it | Love the ride and the J package rocks with the black metallic paint and leather interior | My husband can't stop raving about how comfortable the vehicle is and he does a lot of driving | Although he has to ask permission to drive my Aspen | Ordered all the options except DVD entertainment pkg | LED interior lights are great also | 
 "words": The 5 | 7 engine is the engine of choice | I had the 4 | 7 engine in my 2005 Durango and it use to be weak on hi-way passing power 4 cylinder engine cars would smoke me | Everything about this suv is premium a steal loaded with all options and still 20 grand less than Escalade66000 | I can't believe the amount of compliments I get on it | 
 "words": This is not a Dodge Durango- from the wood grain steering wheel to the leather heated 1st 2nd row seats you know this is from the flagship brand and not the step child Durango | Chrysler did an excellent job quiet roomy interior all the amenities the back up sensor works great and is a must on a vehicle this size | Plus with 0 financing and lifetime warranty there was no choice but to buy this | 
 "words": Chrysler has an invisible winner in the Aspen | We selected the Aspen after testing the following SUVs Tahoe Escalade Yukon Navigator Commander and Sequoia | None of them came equipped with as many standard features as the Aspen for less money | The ride fit finish performance and looks are standouts in the SUV crowd | The 5 | 7 Hemi has terrific performance and decent mileage if you keep your foot out of the throttle | It | s a shame Chrysler toss more advertising dollars at this vehicle to increase customer awareness | I | m constantly getting complements and questions at the gas station with this rig | 
 "words": This is not a pretend SUV I have owned SUV's for 15 years and watched them become watered-down shadows of themselves | In '02 got a new Suburban loved it but GM has done nothing significant with style or powerplant | Chrysler has shown they can combine rugged performance and styling to come up with a vehicle that performs and is appealing to the eye | GM and Ford have allowed their large SUV's to become oafish by comparison | Their design teams just do not get it in my opinion | Europe and Japan aren't making anything comparable for under 70k | 
 "words": From the very first moment you can feel the comfort and ease of handling | It almost drives itself with a smooth ride and fast response | After driving it on a trip how could you ever consider driving anything else | It's a keeper for me and when I am ready for a new vehicle it will be on the top of my list | Chrysler you did it again great job as always | 
 "words": Bought a Yukon Denali in March 07 | Sold it 90 days later because I hated the 3rd row seats that had to be removed | To replace it I test drove a Jeep Commander Mercedes GL 450 Nissan Armada Pathfinder Infiniti QX56 Toyota 4Runner Ford Explorer Expedition Acura MDX etc | -all with fold flat 3rd rows | With 3 kids I need separation on trips | The most accommodating vehicle in terms of comfort and functionality was the Expedition | 3rd row is comfortable even for adults | Steering is accurate and has good feel | Seats are fantastic | But V8 is weak | Jeep Commander Hemi was next and had more features than Aspen i | e | rain sensing wipers but interior was too tight | Aspen had same Hemi | 
 "words": When I first saw this Truck I was impressed | People say it looks like a Durango need to look again | This truck rocks | Drives as smooth as an ocean breeze | Picks up like a rocket and is better on highway gas than my 4 cyl car was | Its not as good city but not bad either | Plenty of room and better features than some of the supposedly top of the line trucks | Chrysler has truly outdone themselves on this one | People are sleeping on this truck but that's okay | I dont mind being the only head turner in town 
 "words": Traded up in the right direction | This vehicle is a far cry from the Import | Great vehicle good performer and looks great inside and out | Little fit problems with the doors and hood other than that it's so far the best SUV I have driven | 
 "words": One word phenomenal | The second I saw a printed ad of this vehicle I told my wife that's it | We'd been shopping for 12-18 months | I rented one on a business trip and immediately began visiting dealerships upon returning | Bought one used saved thousands couldn't be happier | Were leaning toward a 2007 Yukon Tahoe but their 3rd seat has to be lifted out doesn't mostly fold into floor like the Aspen | Ridiculous | I'm an older Gen X'er and I still get told sweet ride by the younger crowd | My kids are thrilled wife hauls the groceries seemlessly and I just punch the Hemi when hauling our boat | Superb vehicle | This is the sleeper SUV no one's talking about | 
 "words": When driving this vehicle you get a sense mof comfort and exictment | this is truly the chrysler 300 of the large suv segment | WE purchased this vehicle because of its looks and because we have not seen to many of this car | The people that think that the aspen is a redesigned Durango need to look twice | The only similarity is the platform that both sit on | 
 "words": Love the power | Starts very quickly | Brakes were a little soft at the beginning until I backed down a hill at 10 mph and applied the brakes | Sound system is awesome | Drives very tight and responsive | 
 "words": I bought this SUV after falling in love with one that my sister has | It is worth a test-drive so that you can erase the stereotypes about Chrysler Dodge | Both the exterior and interior are superb and it seems as if they have practical engineers on the job who designed the car for everyday cost-consciuos people who want an SUV to envy | The features in the Aspen make it worth way more than its cost | The features rival those of pricier car-makers but with a no-frills price | As a VP in marketing I believe the Aspen was created to boost Chrysler's SUV appeal so they put all these top features as a repositioning campaign and more folks need to discover the secret | 
 "words": First family SUV and loving it | Throaty Hemi likes to drink though | I do a lot of city driving and looks like I am still getting around 17mpg | Specs say 27 gal tank | I seem to only be able to get 20 in it | 
 "words": I transitioned to Chrysler several years ago via several company cars and manufacturers failed to live up to the design and quality I was experiencing with Chrysler | Well once again Chrysler has done it | I have the 28J package in the Pearl Black and have already received several positive comments about the look | It drives flawlessly and there is plenty of room to fit my 6'5 frame along with the rest of the family | The interior design is quality leaps and bounds above the competition in addition to the 20 inch wheels along with Hemi put the Escalade Navigator and Denali series to shame | Chrylser needs to advertise more and get the word out they have a winner | 
 "words": Couldn't care less about the Durango and was apprehensive to consider the ASPEN because I thought it was a Durango derivative | Well I was wrong | The ASPEN is a new design that is very well executed | Good fit finish with nice responsive but comfortable handling | Bought the Limited with Hemi and all options | This car rocks | 
 "words": Wow | Nice to see an American Made SUV of such high quality | Quality is evident everywhere from the wood steering wheel to the super comfortable leather | WE LOVE IT | The stability control feature works like a wonder driving in a Snow storm | The HEMI engine is much more powerful than the Sequoia we drive and the vehicle feels more substantial | We loved the Five Star treatment at the dealership | So friendly and helpful | This is our First Chrysler but I'm thinking it won't be the last | Good Job Chrysler | 
 "words": Couldn't ask for a more comfortable car to drive | Love everything about it | Wonderful for kids | Even though it looks a little like a Durango | I get asked all the time how I like it and told that it sure is a beautiful vehicle | As a side point | a Lexus backed into the bumper my damage was 800 | 00 his was 4000 | 00 | I'd say it's pretty sturdy | To bad the Lexus didn't have rear sensors like my Aspen does | Could have saved an insurance claim | 
 "words": my wife chose it over durango for styling | The hemi with mds works well all around | 
 "words": Chose this vehicle over Tahoe and Jeep Commander | Plenty of room for six adults | Handles very well | Excellent fit and finish | Bought with the HEMI | 
 "words": It has the looks comfort amenities of a SUV priced thousands more | The third row has enough room for adults | It has the power to pull my boat it fits in the garage | 
 "words": I am so happy that I purchased the aspen it is a fun stable and beautiful vehicle and I am really enjoying it
 "words": Rented for the Thanksgiving week drove about 1200 miles round trip | Before driving A very executive commanding looking SUV | Smart and simply elegant interior design most everything intuitive | Driver position very nice and adjustable | Lots of nice controls on the wheel | Driving Be easy on the gas because despite its size this SUV will put you in the back of your seat and keep you there through the smooth shifts | Tires and shocks smooth away most jars yet you maintain a nice feel for the road | Road is nicely illuminated with the foglight combo | Aspen makes the long haul trip easy in town driving very manageable but keep your gas card at the ready and plenty of braking room | 
 "words": Purchased last month and paid 4000 off sticker | Great ride and cornering | I tow a snowmobile trailer and it tugs it like you don't know what's behind you | I pack in 8 adults and threw the kids in it yesterday at school | What a great all-round suv built by Daimler Chrysler |

 "words": Just sold Chrysler 300C HEMI and am so happy with the Aspen HEMI | Exact combination of 300C Pacifica and Crossfire that I was craving | Aspen drives so smoothly great acceleration and thrust HEMI is the perfect engine for this SUV |
