REVIEWS
 "words": No doubt this is the best value car in its class compared to E350 BM530 | Trust me it will carry its resell value | However there's no such thing as a perfect car since we're only human | Those YOKOHAMA ADVAN stocks tire making way too much noise on the road | LEXUS please get rid of them and give us a discount on Michelin PS2 | My Yoko still have 60 tread but can't wait to replace them | This is a 47G car there's no reason for us to just keeping listen to the annoying noise | Nav system should be working 100 of the time | Please give us the code for the Nav so our passenger could use it at anytime | Overall this vehicle is still the best buy | 
 "words": Great automobile | Comfort great mileage at high speeds and not a single repair at 40000 miles | My lease is up and I am re-enlisting first Lexus but not the last | 
 "words": I had driven Lincoln cars for several years prior to buying the GS 350 so the difference in handling was a cultural shock to begin with | Driving the Lincoln was a casual experience while driving the GS 350 is 100 consuming | However with the purchase of a new set of tires Good Year Assurance Comfortreads 225 55 17 the GS 350 behaves like a fine automobile should | I went to the dealer and asked for a new set of Good Year tires and they would not put them on for me | The Dunlop tires were shot at 20 k miles and good riddance | I now enjoy driving the GS 350 for a change | Try the Good Year tires you'll love them | 
 "words": Initially I felt a bit cramped moving from an SUV to a car but then I got used to it pretty fast | Overall the car performs great and handles very well | The touch screen controls are great and give the car a new and modern look compared to the competition i | e Infiniti has an analog clock BMW has late 80s LED displays and a confusing controller | The exterior design is awesome but the rear does need some improvement to look a bit sportier | Overall was very reliable | Since mine was a demo it was put through a lot of use and the only problem it has was with a faulty bluetooth module | 
 "words": I have had an issue with the lights turning off when the windshield wash motor initially turns on | Lexus can't find the issue after several attempts | I also have a problem with the car decelerating when turning a sharp corner | I mentioned this to them several times but they told me that it was the traction control | Now there is a recall involving the electric power steering which will solve this problem but Lexus doesn't have the parts necessary to fix the three recall items on this car | I will never buy a Lexus again or any luxury car for that matter | It's all a farce | The quality is not much better but it sure does cost a lot more money | 
 "words": I have had 3 Lexus GS's now and I do say that I love Lexus | Although I do have dash noise as well and I there navigation is unreliable | I have to buy another navigation separate because this one is too hard to function and never takes you in the right place or takes you way out of the way of where you should be going | Also the leather seats seem cheaply painted | I have had the color come off a few times and I wasn't very impressed | But I will say that they drive great and my AWD 350 does get through the snow very well | As far as the Bluetooth I have had no problems I think people are not smart enough to work it | I love mine | Nice looking car as well | But time for something different | 
 "words": This was my first Lexus and was happy with the purchase | I purchased the vehicle for about 47000 loaded | My first problem was with the brakes excessive brake dust and shrieking They gave me the 2 option 1-better quality but noisy or 2-less quality and less noise | Not much of an option | Next problem was the driver side rear mirror | It would get stuck at times | The dealer replace with no charge | Mostly I have been happy with the purchase of a Lexus but expected less of the annoyances for the price of the car | Wanted to know what was people reaction after the recall fix to replace the fuel lines | The car sounds very loud especially when accelerating | 
 "words": We've owned five Lexus in my immediate family | Terrific build quality is their primary appeal | The GS 350 awd in my experience is a flawed poorly built car | The front dash was removed and repaired with a kit to eliminate creaks and groans | The front breaks howl and produce lots of black dust | A kit will be available in Jan | 2009 | Handling is no better than the ES 350 | I expected a reliable almost BMW car | I have an unreliable not quite an ES 350 four door sedan | 
 "words": The only bad things I have seen that people say about the Lexus GS 350 has to do with the inabililty to use the GPS and Bluetooth systems while driving | Actually you can use them while driving if you utilize all the options the GS 350 offers you | You only have limited use of the touch screen while driving but that is what the voice command is for | You can use both the GPS and the Bluetooth to their full advantages if you understand how to use the voice command | You can enter phone numbers and addresses via voice command while driving | Much easier and safer than pushing buttons while driving | Always read directions for your toys before saying they don't work | 
 "words": I have owned BMWs Audis for the past 30 years and my new Lexus blows them both out of the water | Here's a reliable excellent performing sedan with over 300 HP that gets almost 30 MPG on the highway | unbelievable | Great fit and finish and a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": I have owned a Lexus GS350 for almost a year now | Overall it is very high quality and fun to drive | The car does have some drawbacks however | As some others have reported I had problems with an annoying rattle in the dash when it is cold outside and two trips to the dealer seem to have solved the problem | The other surprise was when I bought the car I discovered soon that it would not sync with my treo 650 | Now had to trade my phone for a Motorola Q which works but is a poor substitute as a phone | I thought bluetooth was bluetooth but would suggest a prospective buyer check the website for compatible phones before the purchase | 
 "words": Love our car | It beats the heck out of our numerous BMWs and MBs | The only car we've had that handles better were our Porsches | This car gets a consistent 25 mpg in mixed driving and 28-30 on the highway | Love the look of the car too | Took the run-flats off immediately and installed studless ice tires and use them year round | A lot less road noise and during the winter don't have to chain up as they are approved the same as studded tires for winter driving in Oregon | Haven't seen abnormal wear with the softer rubber and don't have to spend 60 to change out studs in the summer | 
 "words": Just an all-around great comfortable car | Doors close like a 1969 Cadillac that's a good thing | Performance is terrific ride is soft but firm as I like it I have driven for 10 hours straight minus bathroom breaks without having a sore back at the end of the day | FWIW tested the Cadillac STS Acura RL and BMW 535i | I have no doubt that I made the right choice with the Lexus | 
 "words": I have owned several luxury sedans over the past 20 years | While all offered excellent driving experiences there was nothing obnoxious about these vehicles | More recently I was in the market for a new luxury sedan | I looked at the Acura RL for several months but could not get past the uninspired exterior styling | About 6 weeks ago I walked into a Lexus dealer for the first time and fell in love with the GS 350 | It was love at first sight and I made the purchase | But the honeymoon was over in a matter of days | I have since learned this beautiful lady has some serious drawbacks that compromise it | s standing as a serious luxury sedan | 
 "words": This is our first Lexus | We | ve owned Acuras BMWs and Mercedes but the Lexus GS 350 hit the mark for us | The interior styling is absolutely gorgeous the instrument cluster is one of the best I have seen the leather trim is smooth and creamy and the finish on the Red Walnut wood trim is rich and deep | The exterior is also very appealing especially when you upgrade to chrome wheels | The GS 350 is a real head turner | 
 "words": I buy a car every two years and this was my first Lexus | I have always bought BMW or Mercedes but I thought I would give Lexus a try | I loved the GS 350 AWD design features and value for the money but was disappointed in the annoying dash board creaks and rattles | The dealer had the car for two days to take the dashboard apart and install the felt package | I drove off on a 50 degree day in Boston grateful they had fixed it | As soon as the temperature dropped below 40 degrees the dash creak returned | Rather than waste more time on dealer visits I sold the car | I would not buy another Lexus | 
 "words": Great vehicle | A little more road noise than I was expecting even with the performance tires | Trunk opening is too small | Vehicle handles great above average acceleration | Nav system is the pits you need a comp science degree to figure everything out | Also very annoying that you can't operate the GPS Nav while driving | I know it's a safety feature but should be my choice | As is it takes away at least 50 of its usefulness | Vehicle is just a tad too small for my taste on the interior | 
 "words": I'm a former BMW and Mercedes Owner who decided to try a Lexus | I test Drove the GS 350 and realized the ride was Less firm than the BMW's but that was to be expected | Unfortunately I only briefly checked out the electronics | I assumed and you know what that does that if anything the electronics would be better than the BMW | I was Wrong | Not only are the electronics non-intuitive example Nav functions are under 3 different top level buttons but some bureacrat or lawyer in Lexus decided to eliminate most of the functions while the car is moving | This leads to allowing me to speeddial someone but disactivates returning a call and it's the same number of clicks | 
 "words": It's all I expected and then some | The luxury touches are impressive | I have road noise but expected it from the 18 wheels tires | Mileage is great | I run regular gas and get 26-32 mpg depending naturally on driving conditions | I have had BMWs and would again if it wasn't for their mandated run flat tires | Nothing handles like a BMW but I knew that when I bought the Lexus | It's a great car they should offer a bra even Colgan didn't and I have stone chips as a result | 
 "words": After just selling my Mercedes and having owned a BMW as well the Lexus is a great find | It may not have the status of the European models but the performance and reliability is far superior | The drive is so smooth and comfortable it is easy to go beyond the speed limit | In the long run I hope that the resale vaue which is higher will make my purchase the smartest one yet | 
 "words": I love this car but the seats are not as comfortable as they could be for the price and the performace is a bit sluggish in the curves | Overall I love the car but it's not perfect | 
 "words": 99 satisfied with the GS 350 | Beautiful car and rides like a dream except they made a mistake with the Dunlop Run Flat Tires | They are noisy and cause car to pull to the right | Currently asking dealership to switch to Michelin PS2 | Lexus should not equip a car of this luxury with tires that make noise | Otherwise hightly recommend purchase of this car | 
 "words": This is my third Lexus had ES and first GS | Looks are great but ES is more quiet with road noise and engine noise but car has excellent ride | Tires should be changed from Run-Flat Dunlops to Michelins | Dash sold me for it is perfect fit | Lexus cars ride better with increased mileage | Overall a really sharp impressive auto but so far the ES has a better ride with less noise | 
 "words": Just purchased and have 6000 miles so far | The car is everything I expected | Test drove MB Infiniti and Acura | Silky smooth quiet powerful and comfortable all describe this car | Even the exterior design and look has compelled onlookers to offer favorable compliments | It's not one thing in a Lexus it's the total package thats makes it a great buy | 
 "words": This car performs and looks great | However the nav system really stinks | Lexus decided there were functions that I shouldn't use when the car is moving | OK I can then use the voice recognition system | No you can't | That system can't recognize simple voice commands unless you are stopped and the fan is turned off | Useless |

 "words": Drove everything Audi MB BMW Infiniti Acura and can't compare the overall quality and performance | I too have experienced some road noise and changing the tires to different brand Michelin PS2 18 made a world of difference | Can't say enough about the car | It doesn't do one thing great but combination of performance and everyday driving is perfect combination | Can't go wrong getting this car |
