 "words": This truck is by far the best I have owned I researched and test drove Chevy Ford and Toyota prior to this purchase and for base items I got more for the money 5 | 6 V8 18In rims 33 tires etc | In all other trucks these were options that cost way more | Everyday I drive the truck I love it more | I just placed a true Dual Exhaust Flowmaster on it and it sounds and runs great | 
 "words": Overall I like this truck | I receive many compliments on the truck's exterior and roomy interior | I enjoy commuting to work in it | The seats are really comfortable and a good powerful engine | Only complaints are MPG is not so good even though it's a V8 and the shifting column is too long and in the way of me trying to tune the radio cd knobs and buttons | Also the mirror could be a little larger and without the orange reflection at night time vision | 
 "words": This is the 2nd Nissan Titan that I have owned the other one being an 04 LE 2WD | Now I purchased an 07 LE 4WD they are by far the best trucks | I also own an 06 GMC Sierra 4wd and that is like a toy compared to the Titan | Rides like a Caddy and pulls like a 1 ton truck | Check this truck out before you make a decision on any other truck you will not be disappointed |

 "words": I made a huge mistake when I bought this truck | At first it seemed great until I started having a lot of issues | First the transmission then the brakes then dash lights | The list goes on and on | The gas mileage is a joke | My buddy bought a 5 | 7L tundra which has more power and he gets better mileage not to mention when we pull our 4-wheelers he leaves me in the dust | 
 "words": My Titan replaces an 05 F150 w 5 | 4L V8 | Compared to the Ford which was a very good truck the Nissan has a much stronger performing drivetrain and returns fuel economy slightly better than the Ford 5 | 4 did | To me the bucket seats up front are very comfortable though some may find them too firm | The stereo and HVAC controls are laid out well and are easy to use and look very nice even with the orange backlighting | In the back seat I really like the wide opening rear doors when loading people or stuff when parked beside another car | The bag hooks under the back seat are also a nice touch | The stock 33 tires give the truck a very beefy look unlike the competition's smallish tires |

 "words": I test drove Toyota Tundra 07 Ford F150 and Nissan Titan | I liked Toyota Tundra | The reason I went for Nissan Titan was the price | I got a price difference of almost 7000 | Now I regret | I should have gone for Tundra | The ride is terrible in Nissan | It is like you ride on a horse cart | Jumping too much on every road | MPG is not what Nissan says | I get only 13 mpg | Body shape is good | I have a front bench seat | An adult can not sit for a long trip on that seat | Only a child less than 8 years can sit there | But traffic rules never allow a child less than 18 to be a front passenger | 
 "words": I use this truck to tow my boat and get around town with my family | Great power and torque | Very well thought out interior and exterior design overall | Highly recommend |

 "words": Nissan Titan has been tested | No major changes have been made because it was made right from the beginning and set the standards which the others are setting as goals to beat | I just got mine with navigation entertainment sunroof and chrome wheels | Nissan is a strong company and I am comfortable to say that it will run the same 5 years from now | 
 "words": I have a 2007 Titan LE | Good looking truck and that is about all the good I have to say about it | 13 MPG uncomfortable and a vibration I cannot get rid of | I even traded the Goodyear SR-A tires with less then 1000 miles to Michelins in hope that would fix the problem | Another 990 | 00 spent on a vehicle that I wish I had never purchased | I have driven trucks all of my life this is the eigth pick-up I have owned the only new one and by far the most disappointing |
