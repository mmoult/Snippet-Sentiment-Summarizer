REVIEWS
 "words": I drive a considerable amount of miles per year | This car has been the best and most reliable suv I have ever owned | I would buy a new one without a second thought | Ford really got this one right | 
 "words": This is my second Expedition | My first was a 2000 model | This vehicle is comfortable to drive gets decent gas mileage about 18 mph life of vehicle average and is great for transporting people and cargo | But at 36900 miles the front right brake locked up and got super hot | The dealership can't explain what caused the problem | And it is 900 miles out of warranty | This problem hasn't been resolved yet | 
 "words": We really enjoy our EL | It is fun safe roomy quiet gives us about 19 mpg on the highway at 70-80 mph | It gives us about 13 | 8 around the city and I'll pay for the gas for the added safety of the F-150 chassis | The visibility is excellent great mirrors and backup sensors make you look like a pro when parking | The turning radius is better than many small cars | The Limited is about 10K cheaper than the Linclon Navigatior and I can't see the value in the Navigator | The Ford gives you everything you need | You can't go wrong with this vehicle | It's worth every cent of the extra fuel that you burn over a crappy little car that you will learn to hate | 
 "words": My right front brake caliper failed at less than 41000 miles resulting in approx | 700 | 00 in repairs | Ford Motor Company denied any assistance for the repairs on a vehicle that is TWO YEARS OLD | I understand that the vehicle was 4000 miles over warranty however this is a NEW vehicle | I am curious to see if any other Expedition owners have a similiar story to tell | Ford's poor treatment of a long time customer has me doubting my brand loyalty | I am totally dissatisfied with their handling of my situation and advised them I would be sharing my experience with other consumers |

 "words": A true sports car fan but must say I really love the versitillity handling of this vehicle | Ford did a great job on the design both exterior and interior | Bought an 07 closeout so I wasn't able to find all the options desired in the color desired but love it just the same | The stereo is wonderful and road noise is minimal | Love the extra wide back doors which makes loading of both cargo and people so easy | The leg room is great even in the 3rd row | The only item I still have trouble with are the window buttons | I think it is more of an operator than design | Still under 5K in miles but getting 16 MPG and say that will get better | I feel very safe easy to handle and a smooth ride |

 "words": We leased this vehicle in December of 06 as soon as it hit the showroom | We don't have a bunch of kids and use it strictly to go back and forth from our vacation home | The vehicle does not hold up well even with just 2 adults | We have had carpet pull loose twice an armrest break and something happens occasionally at stop lights that feels like another car rear ended us | The dealership tells us they have never heard of this although other owner's Expeditions have been known to do this also | Very underpowered for a vehicle of this size | We don't haul with it have an F250 for that so I can't think of any excuse | Really glad it's a lease can't wait to turn it in | Going back to GM |

 "words": I find this vehicle to be a bit uncomfortable and the fuel economy is unacceptable as far as I'm concerned | Unless you have money to burn I would consider a different SUV | 
 "words": Ford has built a great vehicle | We wanted an SUV that would double as a business vehicle antiques and also serve as our primary vehicle | The comfort sound attenuation ride and handling are incredible like driving a sports sedan |

 "words": On our way to CO from TX we got a chance to test AdvanceTrac with Roll Stability Control | I could easily say this technology saved our lives 8 adults WITH luggage | It was dark and a few deer showed up in front of us | We were going 80mph and my sister instinctively threw the steering wheel sharply to the right | I immediately braced for rollover because a maneuver like that would have surely flipped us over | but it did not | While we fishtailed violently in the aftermath my sister needed only to hold the steering wheel straight | The car regained control soon after and we were all amazed at how it did it | To think what could have happened if this feature hadn | t come standard is frightening | 
 "words": Top of the line 52K Limited literally every option | Love the size comfort quietness rigidity towing capacity and so much more | I owned a 2003 Exp and really loved it | That ownership experience brought me back to buy the new one | Overall Ford has done a spectacular job improving the vehicle | The engine is notably more powerful but the fuel economy still stinks | Of course being over 3 tons what should I expect | My neighbor purchased a new Tahoe and this Exp kicks it big time | I have had lots of vehicles and this one promises to be my favorite yet | I do wish it had a backup camera like the Infiniti and I hope when Ford offers it I can retrofit | Nav system needs improved | 
 "words": This is my 4th Expedition since approximately 1996 the last 3 were Eddie Bauer versions | Without question the 2007 version has undergone the most notable change from any other year | Most significant is the insulation shifter configuration ride and availability of high-end features i | e | heated AC seats auto rear lift close tailgate navigation etc | In my opinion the car is evolving into the Lincoln Navigator LN at a rapid pace | Unless the LN is turbo charged and upgraded with a Rolls Royce transmission these vehicles will be nearly identical in 5-6 years |
