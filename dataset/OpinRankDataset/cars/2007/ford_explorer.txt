REVIEWS
 "words": Love it so far | Haven't had any problems | I think the quality is great and ease of use for the features is my favorite thing about it | 
 "words": This is it great truck for the money | Rides like a expensive car do not even feel the transmission shift | Two years and still get compliments | Powerful V8 pushes me back in the seat | Leather seats are great for long rides COMFORTABLE | Great sales person at dealership still checks on me | 
 "words": I couldn't be happier with this truck | We just turned in our Mercedes R-class and bought this '07 leftover | It rides better than the Mercedes by a long shot and it's a heck of lot more fun to drive | It has everything we wanted including Nav and RES | I'm looking forward to many many years of driving this thing | 
 "words": Bought used in December 2008 | First car payment and not impressed yet | Tranny had to be worked already | Supposely had the certified check over and they forgot to reset oil light and do the recall tranny then | Hope this is not the beginning of seeing the dealer every month | Gas mileage is terrible reads only 12 | 3 avg | But I love the look and the interior especially the leather seats and dual climate control | Have not haul anything yet | I so far enjoy it though
 "words": This is our first SUV after a series of three mini-vans | The Explorer is very well built with no rattles or squeaks | Since it is built on a truck frame the ride can be a little rough on certain terrain | I really wanted a Tahoe but the Eddie Bauer Explorer comparably equipped was 10K less | It is a little smaller vehicle but for 10K it was worth the difference | 
 "words": Love my Explorers this is 4th one to lease and least expensive RWD V6 in high 20's others were EB 4X4V-8's near40G | Never any trouble with any of them very safe do almost anything when safely handled | Lowered ground clearance such a plus in ride experience | Get higher mileage lease you will want to drive it everywhere | Great stereo Great Visibility V6 is sluggish when punched V8's were great and mileage diff miniscule between the two | Power to pull most anything didn't even need 4x4 on last one in NE OH winter RWD just fine too | XLT int fabric is boring | Get the leather heated seats fantastic | Recommend for anyone with good taste and who expects more from their vehicles
 "words": This is the best Ford I have evere owned | My family are Ford truck buyers | This truck is excellent in design and performance | The interior is high quality leather and very quite | Having the fold flat third row seats is something that is essential when hauling kids or large items | The fuel economy isn't that bad considering that there is a 300 hp V8 in it | I get an avg of 19 mpg | This is a great buy for truck lovers or families | 
 "words": So I do love my Explorer | Though there are some problems like others have said | The head rest that get in the way engine takes forever to get up there | I do love the limited | I love the automatic side steps DVD navigation great stereo system | 
 "words": I owned an Explorer previously and it was great | Something went seriously wrong with this model | Since I have had it 9 months I have had the e-brake handle break the rear struts go out the seat belt actually come apart and my drivers seat control panel fall completly off | I didn't even have my car back a week from the mechanic and then this morning water came leaking through the buttons for the reading lightsand no I did not leave my sunroof open | The dealership said one of the drain tubes for the sunroof must have a problem and they would need if for at least three days | So if you cannot tell no I would not recommend this vehicle nor would I recomend any Ford prior to 2004 | 
 "words": We bought our 07 in 07 and have over 20k on the clock | It is an awesome road trip car and tows my 4k lb boat very well even with just the V6 make sure to get 373 gears we get 19-20 mpg in mixed driving | Bad weather is joke with the traction control and auto 4wd | I wish I had better mpg but it's a body on frame truck that ways 4000 and has 373 gears it's only going to do so well | All in all it does very well hauling towing and cruising and I always enjoy driving it | 
 "words": This Explorer rocks | The most stable and quite vehicle that I have ever owned | I have the 4 | 6L V8 which has been at 19 mpg city hwy combined | The only thing that I don't like is the 6 spd tranny | It makes the V8 lag | Should of put the 5 spd that comes with V6 | Good quality interior parts | Smooth looking exterior for a truck | Explorer has 13K miles with no problems so far | 
 "words": I bought this Explorer almost a year ago and have zero problems | I am very happy with it thus far | The 4WD plows throw snow and mud | The traction control is also great in icey conditions | I love the safety features for the family | Everyone who rides along is confortable and satisfied to the fullest | First times usually cant find the exit handle but I think its kinda funny | The V8 has plenty of power but hay I could always use a little more | My one compaint is the amount of interior plastic | Come on can't we spring for something a little more solid | 
 "words": We just purchased our 07' Explorer and we love it | I have done about 1 years worth of research and had narrowed it down to either the Honda Odyssey or the Explorer | We choose the Explorer because we are still very young and wasn't ready to go to the mini-van yet | This Explorer so far has been great drives smoothly no sounds very stylish and lots of extra room which is very important to us with having 2 small children | If you are looking for a new ride with plenty of room for your family and cargo storage this one is it | Gas mileage is also pretty good we get around 22 mpg which isn 't bad considering that it is an SUV although there is always room for improvement | 
 "words": I've owned a lot of Fords and this is the worst | The V8 with the 6 speed transmission lurches from 1st to 2nd gear and again when slowing it feels like you've been rear ended | Ford has issued a lot of TSBs and none can fix the problem | Dealer won't or can't do anything for you and Ford is playing the deaf ear | Mines been in the shop 6 times had a Ford engineer confirm the problem and they still won't buy the darn thing back | I'm going the Lemon Law route to get them to take the lemon back | Too bad for Ford | 
 "words": This iteration of the Explorer has been given a bad rap by the Consumer Reports mavens | It's a competent comfortable reliable ride with only one bad habit it drinks too much | If you need serious hauling capacity sweet highway manners bad-weather bad road capability and aren't averse to a little interior luxury this ride deserves a look | I've had it for almost a year and it's been a pleasure from day one | It laughs at winter and we've had a bad one so far | 
 "words": Enjoy the driving of the car | I drive long distance it is comfortable excellent acceleration handling is great | Drives similar to my Mercedes Benz | Great improvement from the previous model | Dashboard is elegant and instrument panel are easy to read | Great features such as suede heated seats memory seats and on-board computer | 
 "words": Bought a 1 year old rental through a dealer 20K less than new price | Alternatives considered were mini-vans domestic and Japanese other mid size Japanese SUVs | Though reputation was strong for Toyota I found Highlander was very cheap feeling and felt I was doing better here | After 4 months with the vehicle I am very happy with it | No problems good fuel economy highway though nasty when driving only short distances in town with a cold engine | Traction and control in Canadian winter is amazing easily able to take logging roads that left other vehicles stranded with barely a reaction from the traction control system | 
 "words": Picked up the Explorer in March of 07 so far it has been one of the best SUVs that I have owned | Taking it to Vegas twice getting about 22mpg | Feels and handles great | Acceleration from 0- 40 great no problems at all | I opted for the V-6 engine since I only drive on the highway and don't do any heavy towing | DVD Entertainment system was a must for my 2 year old daughter | Overall I am very happy with my Ford | 
 "words": I've had my explorer for about a year now and i still hate it | first off i'm a mountain biker | When i tried to haul a trailer full of weight weenis CrossCountry mountain bikes the Explored bogged down | also there needs to be some fairly substantial mud flaps on this car | Very disapointing V8 | No one can figure out where the inner door handles are and the outside look is about as plain as you can get | this car is unbelievably clumsy and lurpish in real 4 wheelin situations i don't trust it | 
 "words": My 2007 Explorer rides very well the seats are comfortable and the interior noise is minimal | The driver buttons controls are well laid out | The tan leather seats look dirty after six months and the leather does not continue into the rear pockets in the seat backs | The V8 drives nicely and the transmission is very smooth except when coming to a stop where it jerks forward and makes a clunking sound when from 2nd to 1st gear | The dealer recalibrated the transmission | issue is not resolved at this time | 
 "words": We just are getting to the one year anniversary of our Explorer | We love it | Plenty of room for our kids and their soccer baseball volleyball stuff etc | We just finished a trip to Houston about 350 miles round trip and got our best mpg yet a little over 22 hwy | That was with mid-grade fuel and running 75 mph for the most part with some Houston traffic built in | Here's hoping the 2nd yr report is as positive | 
 "words": Ford really hit a home run with the Ironman package | Not only do I like exterior appearance with the black cladding but the two-tone interior against the metal look dash sets off nicely | The heavy duty rubber floor mats are perfect for an SUV | The only thing Ford could do better is fit and finish | They do such a good job everywhere else I hope that they can get everything to line up better in future models | 
 "words": Have had my Explorer for just over 3 weeks now and just love it | I have had Ford Trucks for about 18 years and wanted something with more room | It drives so much nicer than a truck and I find myself alot more comfortable in the Explorer | I love the chrome both inside and out and feel that Ford made some great choices on the interior | Sure the rear headrests are big but I just fold them down and have no problem seeing out | The V-6 is fine for me since I don't plan on hauling anything and the ride is nice and smooth handling is great | The Explorer is built solid and has a great design with quite a bit of room inside | I'm lovin' it | and feel you would also | 
 "words": I drove the Toyota 4 Runner Jeep Hummer H3 Comander and Nissan Pathfinder | All were OK but the Explorer won out | It had more room and the ride was great | I had a 95 and this one stickerd for 5000 less with similar options etc | I cannot believe how much better it got in 2 years | I got the Iron Man because I do not like to be a little different | Unlike the 05 the back is totally flat | I just love this SUV | I am 62 and drive on the beach so a 4X4 was a must | I had 0 porblems with the 05 with just over 40 | 000 miles | I leased that one | I bought this one because I plan on keeping it 10 years and put to many miles on the last one | 
 "words": I traded my 98 Expedition in on my new Eddie Bauer Explorer | I loved my Expedition and had a hard time giving it up | Have been driving the Explorer for a little over a month now and no major complaints this truck is pretty awesome | My rear headrests fold down so no obstruction visually | The looks of the Explorer inside and outside I really like more so than any other mid-size SUV I looked at | A friend of mine bought one and I guess seeing it a lot it sort of grew on me | His roof console came loose a few months after he bought it but the dealer took care of it no charge | So far so good with this vehicle | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Eddie Bauer Explorer | I needed to special order to get a 5-passenger V-8 with the leather suede interior | It was worth the wait | As the vehicle is routinely loaded with 400 900 pounds of cargo the V-8 was a must | This Explorer has a base weight 500 lbs | more than the '98 V-6 it replaced and the V-8 is needed for decent performance when loaded | Around town mileage is about 13 with vehicle not yet broken in | This is about the same as my past V-6 | The added size vs | the past model makes it the max | that will fit in our garage and one mirror must be folded to do so | Good build quality and overall still the best of mid-size SUVs but see below for design-related concerns | 
 "words": We have not owned the Explorer long but so far we love it | We really planned on buying a Tahoe but we bought the Explorer similarly loaded for 9000 less | Of course the Tahoe is a little bigger and we actually thought it drove just a little better than the Explorer but not 9K worth | The Explorer seems solid as a rock no rattles or squeaks whatsoever | 
 "words": I love this 2007 Ford Ironman Explorer | It has just enough room yet not to big | The mileage could be better but I'll live with it | It's fun to drive and I feel safe | I have 3 grandchildren and needed room for them | The 3rd row gives me that | 
 "words": SUV is a fine vehicle except for the fact that I have to drive a mile or two before it will upshift into the higest gear | This contributes to excessive noise and kills gas mileage
 "words": Just bought mine this month and it's a nice car but there could be some improvement | Like the floor mounted shifter gets in the way when I'm driving and trying to change the A C setting or when I'm trying to look for on coming traffic and the oversized rear headrest get in the way | both 2nd and 3rd row | And there seem to be a little bit of lag in the 6 cylinder engine in range acceleration | Other than that everything else is good and since I keep the 3rd seat folded down I can at least see out of the rear window | Rear quarter windows are a different story | 
 "words": '07 E | B | Explorer 4x4 V8 is our 5th Explorer Mountaineer since 1997 | Our new Explorer is the best riding and quietest by far | We do get some wind noise on the highway but the interior cabin is very quiet | We opted for the 'preferred Suede' seating | It's soft to the touch and my wife I are happy because neither one of us like leather it all feels like Vinyl to us | The ride is very comfortable | Access to controls are good | We don't know if the climate control has a problem or if there's a design issue but we have to keep the temp at 76 or higher to stay warm | Not thrilled about the huge headrests in the 2nd row blocks view so we folded them down | V-8 doesn't 'seem' as powerful | 
 "words": I have test driven almost every SUV and crossover in the market that were all similarly priced | I have never owned an Explorer in the past but this is an unexpected pleasure | This truck is one of the best SUV's that I have ever driven | The ride is quiet and smooth and I don't know why it has been written that the Explorer V-8 needs more power this truck can haul | Low end and highway | The interior is smartly designed and easy to navigate though | The Nav system and DVD system are also very easy to use | The sound system is outstanding | Keep up the good work Ford you have a repeat customer | 
 "words": We just bought a Eddie Bauer V6 | Traded up from an 02 Sport Trac | It rides so much better than the Sport Trac | We did not get all the goodies but what we got for our money was a very good value | Looking forward in 3 years to getting a 2010 model | It will be here soon | 
 "words": Pick up the truck 2 days ago | During the first 2 days of ownership I have to say that we enjoy the truck very much quiet smooth wonderful stereo audiophile equipment user friendly DVD and fully integrated Nav system | Independent suspension is probably one of the best in the market | Ventilated disks are very responsive | The award winning V8 definitely deserves its reputation as one of the top 10 engine of the world | The gas mileage is the same as Duratec V6 and is better than most trucks in the market including Japanese competitors | 
 "words": Just bought the XLT with the V8 fairly loaded | Traded up from a 2002 XLT | Very happy so far | Had to hunt around NJ to find a XLT with a V8 and the 2007 appearance package which makes it look a lot cleaner | The new V8 is awesome quiet with a little growl when stepped on | Very smooth acceleration | Would not buy the V6 just too slow | Extremely quiet and confident ride | Also the best thing about any Explorer that nobody talks about is that the seats are very comfortable | Perfect seating for cruising around with your arm hanging out the window on a nice day | Like a real truck |
