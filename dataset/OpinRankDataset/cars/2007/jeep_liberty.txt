REVIEWS
 "words": Seats stain if rain falls on it | Front window broke and on the way to fix it the back broke | Air only works half the time | Dealership replace compressor and still only works half the time | Small glove box poor gas mileage
 "words": I love my Jeep I get 23 mpg and have few complaints | The window regulators will last longer if you clean out the track with a q-tip and then spray with a silicone lubricant | 
 "words": I love my 2007 Liberty hate to let it go but the factory warranty expires in Nov and I'm not impressed with the overall quality of the vehicle and will be trading it in this month | I've replaced five window regulators and that's a lot of time sitting at dealerships waiting for it to be fixed | 
 "words": Lots of power and drives nice I got 21 | 9 miles a gallon on my last fill up | I have had it 3 months with no problems | 
 "words": I bought my liberty in 08 off the lot its Great in the winter and amazing tow cap pulld an empty tracor trailer up a 30grade to get him off the road after he got stuck in the snow and was blocking trafic | granted i was in low gear but i dont get out and push any any more | who needs an F150 HEMI when you have a JEEP 
 "words": The steering is very hard and am not crazy about the tire on the back | The heat controls take a while before going to the selected temperature | Not the best gas mileage either | I paid for built in blou tooth and when I received the vehicle it was installed and not built in | I am still very disappointed with that | I'm not sure that this vehicle is a good value for the money I paid | I've had it since Sept 2007 and All in all to date its an ok vehicle | 
 "words": Overall my Liberty has been a decent vehicle | Handles mountain snowstorms with ease | Like everyone else I have had issues with window regulators failing | Also had to replace the transmission after only 30k miles | Gas mileage isn't great but no surprise with an SUV | 
 "words": If you want a small SUV that has great off-road capability and still provides a decent city and highway ride this is it | I think the folks that have complained about Chrysler standing behind their vehicle should probably look at their dealership | I have had exceptional warranty service | 
 "words": Well we now have had problems with a window regulator | Luckily the dealership replaced one with the new updated model that corrects the defect | Although the dealership would not use the word defective | Our mileage continues to be great after the syn lubes PI in the tank Costco Michelin tires with nitrogen | 25 mpg not too bad for 4x4 | We cannot thank our Master mechanic enough for recreating our Jeep with great parts like Bosch Platinum4 100000 mile spark plugs and Amsoil synthetic lubes | We change oil only once a year now we like that | And under the Magnuson-Moss act of 1974 syn | extended oil changes cannot void warranties | If the dealership says otherwise they are lying | 
 "words": Obviously the Jeep is geared for power not for mileage so any aftermarket improvements you can make will help the mileage | Never use Goodyear tires as their rolling resistance is horrible | 20 of the Jeeps energy is wasted just on tire rolling resistance | We use Michelin tires and that helps greatly | A friend uses synthetic lubes throughout and a cold air intake by KN | The new Liberties are way to boxy and just don't seem to have the heart of the earlier Liberties | Others may disagree but that is my take | With some aftermarket improved parts you will have a better performing vehicle with better gas mileage | 
 "words": This is a follow up review 2 years old 30k miles | Overall we still enjoy the Liberty | It is an average small SUV but the american manufacturing is definitely show through | Still under warranty so all window regulators have been replaced at least once some twice | Seats are very uncomfortable on long road trips very little lumbar support | MPG is actually pretty decent for a V6 3 | 7L on road trips city MPG is horrible 16 city 25 highway | Decent amount of cargo with seats folded down | We have enjoyed it so far but won't buy another | This is our first American car and we have decided to stick with foreign | 
 "words": Is a great vehicle if not for the window regulator issue | Windows can fail at any time especially in hot climates | Rides very well little disappointed in gas economy but otherwise has been a great little SUV | 
 "words": I've recently purchased a used 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport and have enjoyed the driving experience | This Jeep offers a solid ride with great sight lines almost no blind spots | The Jeep handles any road conditions I live in a snow belt area and the smooth shift-on-the-fly 4X4 feature makes for confident and safe driving on the worst of roads | This vehicle handles well in both highway and city driving | It offers tons of space inside but is easy to park on a downtown street | The sound system is good all dash board controls are within convenient reach and the center located window controls are a neat idea | The back tailgate window set up is unique and works like a charm | This Jeep is a keeper | 
 "words": Windows stick | Required dealership repair | Glass on from windshield broke | Cause of break is not apparent obvious | the cabin gives no protection from road noise wind noises etc Makes for a very noisy ride | Stereo system is mediocre at best | 
 "words": No problems yet with windows | But I pulled a car out of a ditch and guess what | No tow hooks or solid bumper to put a chain on | All plastic this is a Jeep right | Just enough room to fit a nice 8 pointer in | Fun to drive in the woods and mud | 
 "words": I like this liberty it's my first | I've owned cherokees grand cherokees wranglers and good 'ol cj's | Every one did what I expected and nothing I didn't | Some of these reviews whine about fuel mileage or ride comfort if you want 50 mpg and a soft ride | Buy a prius | Of course you'll get stuck on wet Grass and wreck it in a 2 inch deep road rut | I bought a Jeep to use like a Jeep | The liberty gets acceptable mileage considering the gearing suspension aerodynamics of the vehicle and the ride is good for something that has the off road abilities it does | Fine auto deserves the Jeep name | 
 "words": I had my liberty for a year and a half and absolutely loved it minus a few problems with the windows | However I recently ran off the road hit a culvert took a nose dive and then flipped | My airbags did not go off even thought I took a nose dive | Also my seat belt never locked | The car did holdup well and all 4 doors still opened easily even though I ended up up side down | But the seat belt should have at least locked this was very dangerous | 
 "words": I too have had problems with my electric windows | Have had the car exactly 1 year now three of my windows have broke on me | Ridiculous that so many of us have repeatedly experienced the same problem but no fix actions have been taken | Have heard many negative reviews about Chrysler products and this is making me think twice about purchasing another one | Several of the fitting for the outside plastic trim were also broken and the trim loose when sold to me | Again quality control really needs to be addressed | 
 "words": I just bought a used 2007 Jeep liberty sport and I love it so far the gas last for a long time and its so fun to drive | The sound system is great and I love that its so roomy but their is on thing | How do you turn the air bag on the passengar side I cant figure it out at all | the manul dosent say | Help me plz
 "words": I drive my Liberty 25000 miles year | I can get 25 mpg on the highway if I use cruise control and keep the speed at 70 | About 21 mpg around town | I is very comfortable on a long trip | Lots of cargo space | Very reliable so far | I've had it for a year and bought it used | I would definitely buy another one | 
 "words": My 07 Liberty is a great vehicle | Window regulator broke too but they fixed it | I've had the car since Oct 07 and have 23000 miles | Took it in for NYS insp | and found I needed new pads and rotors | Mechanic said it shouldn't have done that | I'm pretty easy on the brakes and that isn't a lot of miles | Cost me over 300 for just the front brakes | Chrysler should be ashamed for making inferior parts for such a nice vehicle | Talked to several mechanics and they all said the brakes on the Liberty are really bad | I am disappointed in that | The gas mileage isn't that great either | Agree that the window controls shouldn't be in center console | 
 "words": I love our Liberty | We take it just about everywhere yet the windows on the driver side no longer work | The window lost its ability to go up and down and will be expensive to have it fixed | I tried searching for recalls but to no avail | I am glad that I am not the only one with this problem | The problem with the windows is a vehicle problem and not the owner's fault | 
 "words": I purchased this car new | Since February 2007 the window regulators parts that Hold up the windows have been repaired 5 times | Many people have this problem with Jeeps years 2004 2005 2006 2007 and waiting to see if 2008 does too | Contacted Chrysler and they told me they had no info about a permanent fix | Not helpful at all | The car is a lemon | Also stain resistant seats are not stain resistant | Many owners spill water on seat like me and water leaves a brown stain on the stain resistant seats | What a joke | 
 "words": We too noticed right off the bat that the gas mileage was horrible about 16 mpg average we took our jeep to a great mechanic who laughed and said you need to understand that Chrysler uses crap parts he started by lubing with amsoil synthetic threw away crap spark plugs and installed Bosch Platinum 4's nitrogen in the tires and now we average 25 mpg which is a great improvement | Dealership wanted 500 | 00 to change spark plugs every 30k said would take 1 1 2 hour they lied mechanic showed me how easy it was took 20 minutes and Bosch plugs are 100k mile plugs | Don't trust dealerships they steal your money | 
 "words": It's fun to drive it hauls lots of stuff in the back the seats aren't comfy at all and hard for a short person to adjust | The gas mileage should be better for the size but I love the 6 cyl power | Why did my windows break at only 1 yr 6000mi and the dealer tells me they always do that in Libertys and Jeep has chosen to NOT address the issues | I will not buy another Jeep | The dealership told me we will continue to have to replace the widow assembly because they always break | Now my dash is buckling | The dealer says it's because we live in the desert | Then why isn't it happening to our 2 other cars that are older | 
 "words": I bought my Liberty Sept | 07 and have been in love with it ever since | Previously I had a Ford Focus which I disliked and wanted something bigger and better in the snow since I live in PA | It drives great in the snow and on anything you throw its way | Quick on the highway | Approx | 20 mpg which isn't awful but it would be nice if it was better | I'm not sure why people complain about the window controls | I had a Mercedes and they were in the same place | I like them there since the driver and passenger can control them | Comfortable driver seat | So much fun to drive | I'll never own anything other than a Jeep | 
 "words": I have had my jeep Liberty for almost a year | It's very quick on the highway | I drive from Burlington to Asheville twice a week and I love the way it handles on the drive up to the mountains | I get about 19-20 mph and it's ok since gas is 4 | 00 per gallon | I do have a problem with the electric windows and had to fix the drivers side window twice | It needed to be replaced | My back passenger window has also broke | They seem to not close properly and are not easily fixed | I checked for a recall but none yet | Overall I love my suv | 
 "words": Generally I love my jeep | It's my 3rd having had a 1991 Cherokee and a 1995 Grand Cherokee | I was initially sold only because of the warranty and features the previous 2 had a lot of problems | Now I'm really happy with it | It rides well off roads is amazing in snow and mud and drives reasonably on the road | It's been reliable even compared to more reliable cars a few of my friends purchased at about the same time | The gas mileage seems to be about the same as my 5 | 2L V8 Grand Cherokee while being a good bit smaller | Also the ground clearance is limited compared to my previous jeeps | which are my only complaints | Some complain about window controls but I've had BMW's-same place 
 "words": I bought my Jeep in Jan 07 and wanted to drive it for awhile before reviewing it | So far I am very happy with it | I live in the snow belt and drive a lot for work it handled the snow with no problems | I always felt like it was holding the road and it went through anything I asked it to | I have no idea why the window controls are in the middle and wish the cup holders shifter were reversed but not a big deal | I looked Toyota Honda Chevy but think I made the best choice for the money | My husband bought a Ranger but now wants my Jeep we race for the keys | Over all I can't find anything I really don't like my next one will be the new model with the huge sunroof | Great little SUV | 
 "words": I just purchased my Liberty 6 months ago and even though I love driving it I'm thinking of trading it in | With the soaring gas prices and the way this SUV loves to drink it it is costing me a lot of money in gas | It is very cute and I love the way it handles | There is plenty of room for the kids in the back and I like the way that the back door opens | As I read in other reviews the glove box is small | there is however a slot over it that holds the owners manual | I don't like where the window controls are located and they would be better on the doors | To sum it up however it is a cute fun to drive vehicle that has a lot of pep | I would recommend it if you can afford the gas | 
 "words": Overall nice SUV | Perfect for a little family looking for something safe | Ours has over 15k and we have not had any problems | The ac seems to struggle in the hot desert summer as well the windows do seem to struggle at times | We love the power and the versatility of the Liberty | The gas mileage isn't the best but what can you expect from a V6 SUV | It gets about the same as my 2000 Nissan Maxima AVG 20 I wasn't fond of the body style but my wife loved it and it is growing on me | For the price you can't go wrong | It's our first Jeep so we'll see if we can run it for 10 years like I know they are capable of | 
 "words": Wanted car that was rugged and could stand bumps without feeling that you damaged something | The ride is rugged and smooth so is the auto shifting | Gas mileage is poor 17-20 mpg with the cost of gas | The storage capability is also poor glove box is small and so it the front storage bin | 
 "words": I love my little liberty | My first car was a '91 Cherokee and I had until now been unable to find something that compared to that car | This is it | It is fun to drive comfortable quick and cute | I wanted a manual and had to search high and low to get it but I did | the gas mileage is very good highway not so great in the city though | My only complaint is that there is rust on the rims and the car is still only 5 months old | The dealership says they will paint it so right now I am battling them to have them completely replaced | Other that than that I am in LOVE with my car | 
 "words": I've had my Liberty for a year | The car is comfortable and fun to drive | Gas mileage is about 19 mpg | Great SUV for running around town rear seats fold down when to carry larger items and two adults can sit comfortably in the back | I highly recommend buying the Liberty and I will buy a second one in the future | Also glove box does hold the owner's manual | 
 "words": We purchased this vehicle as a replacement for a 2003 Hyundai Elantra | With a new baby we needed more room | The 2007 Jeep Liberty Limited is not the vehicle for a growing family | The owner's manual doesn't even fit in the glovebox there's no storage | The trunk is very tiny | I thought I could live with the back hinge door but its annoying and heavy | We have had a lot of problems with the front windows not rolling up properly and have taken it to the dealership 3 times they basically can't fix it | The gas mileage is terrible | I get 18 mpg | The doors don't close properly you have to slam them shut | It's not comfortable on a long trip | Wish we hadn't bought it | 
 "words": I've had my Liberty for 1 month and it's OK | Gas mileage is OK at 24 mpg | The ride is good but a little bumpy on rough roads | The seats sit high and give the driver a commanding view but they can be uncomfortable on longer trips | It does great in the snow even in 2 wheel | As for convenience features it has a lot to be desired no storage areas other than the glovebox and a small compartment between the front seats | You have to stretch to reach temperature controls as they sit low on the dash | It's a good vehichle for short trips but not the best family car to purchase | 
 "words": Overall the ride is nice | The mileage is better than I expected | I get 23 miles to the gallon but these are mainly hwy miles since I commute to work | I love the style and to get a 4WD drive for 20000 with all the features | I bought it used with 3000 miles on it | I feel I got a very good deal | I traded my Camry because we are moving to the mountains I gave up some luxury but there is no way my Camry could have handled the mountains | 
 "words": I have owned numerous Chrysler products and this is the last one | Chrysler will not stand behind their vehicle as I have had the Jeep in four times for a surging issue which they cannot fix | Chrysler does not seem concerned to make it right either | The last three Chrylsers have ALL had transmission issues and this Liberty is no exception | If you buy any Chrysler and have any problems do not expect the company to stand behind their products | because they won't | 
 "words": I've had a 2005 Rocky Mountain Edition and traded it in for my 2007 | I love it | The seats are more comfortable than 2005 and got all the options | Actually have better gas mileage this time around | 
 "words": The Liberty handles very well on all types of road conditions | It corners well and the suspension is less bouncy than many other SUVs that I've ridden in | With this vehicle I actually enjoyed driving in deep snow in upstate NY for the first time in 20 years | The Liberty has plenty of interior space for hauling items and is designed nicely | Overall it is a rugged and fun vehicle to drive | Mileage is actually better in highway conditions 26-27 mpg than expected | 
 "words": I just bought my first Jeep | I love it and would'nt go back | I have already taken it up to the mountains and had some memorable fun with my son | I looked for a very long time at different outfits and I kept coming back to the Liberty | I bought the sport but am very happy that if I want to later on I can add anything I would like to it and have it have the factory look | It handles great and has great get up and go | Coming from a girl who had a sports car I really love that | I love looking at it dirty or clean it's perfect | 
 "words": Initially I had some doubts about an SUV but the Jeep Liberty has convinced me otherwise | It is a very solid reliable vehicle | Great in the snow | Nice seating position | Nice feature content | Needs a bit more refinement of materials and ergonomics on the inside | Hidden compartment in trunk area would be nice addition | 
 "words": I wanted to get a 4x4 and it came down to Jeep or Land Rover | Land Rover's are overpriced and not any better than the Liberty | This is the best 4x4 you can buy | It handles great and is great on the trail | I have had no problems with it so far | Overall a great vehicle with excellent build quality and great trail rated capability | 
 "words": Looking for a small mid-size SUV that really is a Sport Utility Vehicle | They're are very few choices left and the Liberty has always been a front-runner | The right combination of Old-School tried and true Jeep four wheeler know-how and a good helping of modern safety capability and convenience additions | It's not my first Jeep but it is my favorite so far | I have the 2007 Latitude Edition and love the combinations of features and pricing | Only thing I miss | Mine doesn't have the overhead trip-computer oh well | Overall a great vehicle | Styling has held up extremely well since the introduction and if you don't like the BOX trend that Jeep's following get one now while you can | 
 "words": This is our second Jeep Liberty | The 2007 Limited model has all the bells | Again it's fun to drive and can still handle a sizable load | The 200 came with Sirius radio for a year and so far a great addition | It is also equiped with the above center console | Love the temperature and direction indicator | It also has the tire air presure electronic gauge | With the incentives at the time it's hard to pass up against the crowded SUV field | 
 "words": In a sea of poor decisions I make a good one | Best thing I've done | Rides great has power very nimble and great for any necessary off-roading that may come up | Not to mention I'm saving over a hundred bucks a month | I have a small family and it works for them too | Very stylish interior and the chrome accents really round of the exterior | Jeep had me at honk-honk
 "words": Have about 1000 miles on the Liberty | So far most of the driving has been in the city | To date the city driving mpg has been 17 | Overall we are very happy with the new jeep | My first jeep and the way things are going it won't be our last | 
 "words": I've been four wheeling in Chevy pickups since 1967 | Well time for a change went to a Jeep Liberty 6 speed | It is much easier to drive | Where the Chevy used brute strength torque and ground clerance to clear obstacles the Jeep does it by finesse the coil spring suspension conforms to the terrain providing traction | I love the 6 speed nice and tight and a good feel | It is very European snick snick snick as I run through the gears | The Liberty is set up for off-road good articultion and little front or rear overhang | It is not a cross-over car-based SUV like the Honda CRV or Toyota RAV4 it should not be compared to them in terms of fuel economy and ride | 
 "words": This is my second Liberty | I traded a 2004 Limited up for a fully loaded 2007 Limited | The incentives were great and so was the trade | The new car has improved gas mileage and greater creature comforts than my 2004 model these include 6-disc CD player Sirius radio leather seats sun roof on the wheel radio controls | It is comfortable on good roads and on bad roads | Handling is easy | Seems a bit higher off the road than the 2004 model and the back seats now go down flat so as to open up the rear for more cargo which for me includes a 75 pound dog | Plenty of space in the cargo area with the seats down | Great car | 
 "words": Very fun vehicle | I have the 6 speed manual | The gas mileage isn't too bad if you're on the highway in 6th and running 2WD | With 4WD and driving hard in the snow the gas mileage suffers but the capabilities of this vehicle in the snow make up for it | 4WD LO range for shows this is a true offroad capable Jeep | Most of the competition is car based | I wish Jeep would keep going in this direction for its new vehicles but it looks like they're trending towards more carlike lower profile vehicles with the Dodge Chrysler short side windows | Get one while you can | 
 "words": Well I think it is a nice vehicle so far | It's just hard to get over the 14 | 5 mpg it's getting | And thats driving it like a gentle baby | Hate to see how bad it would be if I were heavy footed | 
 "words": If you need an SUV that can handle rough roads and give you a smooth ride there is no questions this is the best | I test drove every other SUV in this size range and above and kept coming back to the Liberty | I own one and have just ordered a second | It is great on the highway tight cornering in the city and just tackles the rough roads like nobody's business | I've had my first one through 7 count 'em 7 hurricanes in Florida | Deep flooded areas | Into the Everglades down to the beach | Great to drive no let me correct that FUN to drive | I've got over 120000 miles and just getting another before they change the body style | 
 "words": I love it so much I bought a second one and will buy a third because it meets the needs of my family living on a mountain | Handles tight hilly roads even in the sleet snow | Roomy enough inside for my large frame | Covered expandable cargo area carries stuff from mulch to the larger unexpected garage sale treasure | My wife bought one too |
