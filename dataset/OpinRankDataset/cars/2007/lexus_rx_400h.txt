REVIEWS
 "words": My Lexus 400h is the best car I've ever owned and I've own Beamers and Mercs | I get 28 | 5 mpg on mostly interstate driving during the summer and 25 | 5 mpg in the winter | Somehow my 21 year own son can get 32 mpg swear on my mother | Believe me when I say I don't know how because he has a lead foot | This car is smooth and quiet | Love the CVT and I don't miss the transmission shift bump | I'm buying the 2010 RX 450h when it comes out and I'm trading my wife's 2006 IS250 for the HS250 when it comes out in the fall of 2009 | 
 "words": We purchased this vehicle solely for the gas mileage that was claimed on the sticker and what the dealer said it would actually get | We were very disappointed when it got 35-40 less then what they claimed | Around the city the best we were able to achieve was 19 | 6 mpg when the sticker and dealer claimed it would get 31 mpg or better | We even had a factory rep from Lexus drive the car and he could not get it over 20 mpg | This car is terrible | Lexus would not stand behind it and told us that there was nothing they would do | We lost 13k selling it back to the dealer | 
 "words": The 400h has great acceleration | It is a well built car and very comfortable | Average gas mileage is 28 MPG therefore consistent with other reviews | The navigation system is the worst part of the package | Acura has an excellent navigation system | 
 "words": Especially for mountain driving this car is high performance | I like the low emission which helps the environment and increases the pleasure of driving this car | 
 "words": The navigation system is impossibly complicated and I'm a PhD Professional Engineer | It is simply illogical | The cargo space is disappointingly shallow | The screen is unreadable in bright daylight | But the performance is good and very reliable | However as a Mercedes S-Class person Lexus is outclassed | 
 "words": I am a Lexus person and have an LS 430 which I think is the best vehicle I have ever owned | I have been disappointed with the RX400h | The fuel economy is below expectations at 19-20 in normal driving which is mostly in town and 22-23 on a trip | I have asked the dealership about this and they mostly just shrug their shoulders | It seems to me the gas engine cuts in at too low a speed | The front seat is too small for me at 6'2 both in seat size and headroom | Have had battery problems | Battery is too small | Also it seems that the dealership is still not up to speed on the hybrid model | They keep telling me to call Lexus directly | Disappointing | 
 "words": This is a great car but don't bother buying the nav system | The system is virtually disabled when the car is moving | You cannot input anything into the system unless you pull over and stop the vehicle | This bug makes the system almost useless | Buy a portable Garmin unit instead it will save you money and frustration | 
 "words": OK I was a skeptic going into this hybrid stuff but today we turned 2000 miles on our RX bought the first week of June and I'm now a convert | We're averaging right at 28 mpg with mixed driving | One concern I had was how well the a c would be and maybe overheating | Not to worry car spent a week in the Indian Wells Palm Springs area in 115 heat and it did a terrific job | The nav system is excellent but it takes a little time and patience to get the hang of it | The hands free bluetooth phone tie-in is superb | One quirky thing | I have noticed a little surging in freeway driving when using cruise control not sure whether or not it's the car or the road yet
 "words": Best of both worlds in that my RX has the torque to move briskly as well as a return of decent fuel mileage when driven conservatively | And it's a ULEV | Navigation is cumbersome and simplistically inflexible | Nav voice command search returns nearest X and you either take it or stop to search the database thru layers of menu options or find it on your own | Wind noise that I didn't expect in a Lexus | CVT is smooth | Interior nicely appointed flawlessly assembled inside and out | Smooth quiet IC engine | ICE runs efficiently at highway speeds and had no problems going over mountain passes thru Idaho and Montana | Overall a very well put together vehicle that I am glad I jumped into | 
 "words": Our 400h has truly exceeded all of our expectations | We are getting an average of 28 mpg with mixed driving on streets and freeways mainly streets | The road feel is extraordinary | It feels like we are floating on air the brakes and steering are tight and efficient and it's the quietest car we've ever driven | The back seat reclining is a brilliant idea for making the back feel spacious | The vehicle takes hills with ease and seems effortless in daily driving | The only downside is the navigation system which is cumbersome difficult to program and works only in an off or no movement position | Otherwise we recommend this to anyone for an exceptional ride and drive experience | 
 "words": I test drove the Acura MDX and went with the Lexus and have been extremely happy | I am getting about 25-27 mpg depending on how aggressively I drive which is pretty good compared to other SUVs | The ride is extremely smooth and quiet and the car has an extra kick when you need to pass up a hill even with a full car | No real gripes at all | 
 "words": Well so far this has been the most exciting car we've purchased | We added the premium package with the camera nav wood leather moon roof then also added color matched running boards and chrome wheels | Driving is a whole new experience especially boppin' around downtown on electric only | Unbeknownst to me my neighbor bought the same model on the same day and we didn't even discuss beforehand | Best purchase I've made in a long time | 
 "words": Fuel mileage is not all that great and I had a lot of road noise in this vehicle | The rest of the vehicle was splendid | Awesome driving performance Mark Levinson Sound technology etc | 
 "words": Beautiful build quality exceptional features | I am a sports car owner driver and I find it interesting that this car has made me change my driving habits as I strive to maximize my efficiency | If you want maximimum mpg performance this is a must and it leads to safer driving habits on the road also | Having said that it will get up and go if you romp on it | Typical Lexus luxury | Also ignore recomendation for premium gas 89 octane works just fine with no appreciable loss in performance or mpg | 
 "words": I bought my RX 400h after much research and thought | Lexus name plate puts some back you bought a Lexus | but the hybrid part really perks up ears | I even got a statement you never seemed like the hybrid type | Mileage is good fun to watch the gauge wish it had backup alarm camera is good | Prev issues have been addressed nav is outstanding not grainy SAT is now available discrete word Hybrid on side says enough | Power is amazing when you need it | Friends all want a ride never had that in any other car | Takes a bit of getting used to wind down at stops and lack of motor noise at start up but not a problem | A C keeps going even with gas motor off | Great car | 
 "words": I researched and test drove the following Acura RDX MDX BMW X3 X5 the Lexus blows them all away | As a former 4Runner owner I again am more than satisfied with the typical perfection in Japanese build quality | The complaints I have heard on the 400h I have yet to experience i | e | the jerking sensation when shifting from electric to gas | 
 "words": I love everything about this car | And by the way I | m 5 | 11 | and there is plenty of leg and head room for both front rear passengers | I have been very impressed with how quiet the vehicle is how easy it is to drive parking is a breeze | and how quickly smoothly the car accelerates | I have been averaging 29 | 5 since temps have risen above 60 | In the winter I was averaging 25 | 0 | On the highway you will get your best mileage if you keep the car at 65 or less | Mileage drops a bit once you start cruising at 70 or above | Note that this car is designed for optimal performance and not optimal fuel economy | Don't buy if your main goal is to save money on gas | 
 "words": You should think twice before buying this vehicle | I am only 5'6 and when delivered the front seats of my 400h would not go back far enough and had to be unbolted and moved at a 500 expense to me | Also my head is against the roof with the seat all the way down | The front seat belts are too short and extensions have to be used which compromise safety | The car lunges forward usually in park when it switches from electric to gas engine | Gas use runs 20 mpg in town and 17 mpg on the road | It has been back to the dealer and they say there is nothing wrong with the vehicle | 
 "words": Looking for a SUV that offers luxury was hard to find | Lexus certainly has the market cornered when it comes to combining luxury sport and fuel economy | The best purchase I have made yet | 
 "words": We needed more cargo space in our vehicles but didn't want a gas guzzling SUV | The Lexus has proved to be a wonderful solution we have plenty of cargo space inside and on the roof and the hybrid system while taking some time to get used to has been just terrific | The ride is smooth and quiet the hybrid drive works flawlessly and is a wonder to watch on the monitor and there is more than enough power when you need it | The entire vehicle is beautifully built roomy and very well equipped | The navigation system is a bit daunting at first but use the quick guide you'll be fine | Mileage is getting there when broken in we think it will be just about at published levels | Fantastic | 
 "words": Never bought a car for the ride but one Lexus test drive had me hooked | Originally came from the Volvo for Life Family but Volvo sold me a 2003 XC90 with too many problems | I want quality safety service and piece of mind | Instantly fell in love with Lexus | hybrid ride | Could not tell SUV was on | Talk about get up go | This baby has power | I keep the cruse control on because I am worried about speeding | It is like floating on a cloud don | t realize how fast you | re going | Was hoping for better gas mileage | Getting anywhere from 26 to 27 mpg drive both highway and city | Better than what I was getting before so I | m still pleased | Manual says it gets better after 5000 miles | Will see | 
 "words": I was determined to buy a hybrid this year one that would last until the market would be open wider in terms of alternative fuels | I currently get about 30 mpg and this is almost 2-1 2 times my previous vehicle | LOVE IT superb | Bravo Toyota | 
 "words": Great SUV best ride ever | Could have more room between the front seats | Good gas mileage not as expected but good enough | I've been driving it since February 06 and can't get over how quiet it is | I'm never tired of driving this car | 
 "words": I just picked up my 07 RX 400h on 9 11 | I'm still trying to get used to no engine starting when I turn the key | Very quiet and smooth ride | Fuel economy is avg | around 24-25 mpg over the first 100 miles about 50 50 hwy city I have a little bit of a foot but have been going pretty gentle on the pedal | I have made a couple of individual 5-10 mile trips in city with up to 32 mpg | I'm happy with 25 mpg compared to my Lin | Nav at 10 mpg | Had an issue this morning with a dead ICE battery | Lexus sent out AAA who didn't know squat about hybrids so I ended up reading the owners manual to the tow truck driver | A quick jump start and everything was fine I hope |
