REVIEWS
 "words": Great car | It really is a great package sports car performance with room for 5 | Though the rear seats are tight there fine for my 3 younger children | Great performace engine brakes handling does all very well | I like the 08 M3 coupe but it only seats 4 and the 08 M3 sedan looks too much like a plain 3 series | Audi hit a bulls eye with styling for a 4 door car | Bulging wheel flares remind me of a mid 1980's 911 Turbo | Audi builds a great car and the RS4 is a total package of performance quality and style | 
 "words": It is difficult to find any fault with this extremely well engineered car | Its DRC offers a very compliant ride when desired but stiffens in the corners for confident handling in aggressive mode | The engine is superb and an aftermarket exhaust system several are available actually makes meaningfully more power | Its redline is 8250 rpm and it is a joy to drive with smoothly delivered power across the rpm range | Winter handling with winter tires is exceptional and the car is on rails in hard packed snow | The design is distinctive even compared to current model A4s | Perhaps the only thing that I would change is the seat height which does not lower sufficiently for me I am 6' | 
 "words": Coming from an 2005 S4 my 07 RS4 is a completely different beast | Has more power much better suspension looks better feels better just a better car and yes you pay for it | However I would like to see more power because people who buy RS4s crave power and 420hp just isn't enough once you get used to it | 
 "words":  I would have to say that this car is the most practical performance saloon on the market today | The amount of power you get from that 4 | 2litre V8 is astonishing | The handling far surpasses anything else in this range | Audis of old used to be really nose heavy and the understeer alot but with this one you really have the confidence to shove it into the bends | I think this car is better than an M3 | 
 "words": This car is just ridiculous | You can carry a family comfortably in it and still will blow ANYONE off the line | I had an S4 before this and it's well worth the investment | The best way to describe this car is an S4 on steroids | I haven't had any problems with this car and didn't have any with my S4 either | Take care of the car and it will take care of you for sure | No one ever needs a car this fast but why not have it anyway | 
 "words": This car is all that is cracked up to be | they put all their eggs into this automobile | It handles like a scapel and is so quick that I have never had this kind of thrill | I have had an M3 and a 1997 911 and no car ever has delivered like this one | Worth the money and what you can expect to get in mileage with this kind of power | 
 "words": I've owned a total of 4 different Audis based on the A4 so far a 1 | 8T a 2 | 8 an S4 and now an RS4 | Clearly the RS4 is vastly superior to the earlier cars surprise surprise | Huge fun to drive awesome acceleration outstanding handling stopping power at the same time comfortable fine for everyday driving it easily seats four people | Still in lust with it after a year or so of owning it | a total sleeper | it doesn't turn heads until you stomp it | Then it moves | 
 "words": I have 6000 miles on my RS4 with no vibrations no oil consumption and no questions of build quality | The car is just wonderful | Power is smooth and a lot of it there | I am averaging up to 25 MPG hwy avg speed of 79 MPH | I want my gas guzzler tax back | The car handles very well for a 4000 lb vehicle | The 60 40 front rear Quattro bias is great | I have yet to feel front torque steer which I found quite often on my B6 S4 | On the street highway the car is perfect | On the track the DRC with the 400 lb spring rates is inadequate Esses Infineon | The brakes are not meant for track use and the pad wear will be a problem | Replacement pads and rotors are not cheap | 
 "words": Having previously owned an LS 400 Lexus BMW 325 and the S4 2005 model I find that the Audi RS4 without any doubt it is the most exciting and most comfortable car I've had the pleasure to drive | The interior design is exquisite and the aggressive exterior finishes this car superbly | Then of course there is the V8 4 | 2 FSI engine which tops it all with that purfect sound to go with it | A wee bit on the expensive side but I truly believe one gets what one pays for with this unique car | 
 "words": I came out of an S4 and bought the RS4 after an ample test drive | The driving dynamics and engine feel remind me of me 1997 M3 first of three I owned which I felt handled better than the 2001 and 2004 models I had | It's still a little nose heavy but compared to the S4 it's really hardly noticeable and the braking engine and lateral stability are outstanding | Its really a wonderful machine and the all wheel drive in the midwest makes it a near must | If you are an M3 fan you should really try this car before the next M3 especially if you are in the midwest or northeast | Personally even though its heavier I couldn't bring myself to give up the all wheel drive | Try it and see | 
 "words": Don't judge a book by its cover | This is all race and high performance from the word go | A small innocent looking button on the center console is marked with a green S | it should come with a warning no amateur drivers professionals only | This car is for the owner that appreciates and understands performance | 
 "words": The best car I ever had satisfaction for someone that has had the best cars the mixture of performances in the RS4 make it the best car in its class
 "words": I just recently purchased the RS4 and every time that I just look at my car which is often I get a silly grin on my face and my heart starts to race | I remember feeling this way when I had my first love | Forget the performance of this car there's nothing out there in it's class to dispute that | Some of my freinds said to me that I should go with something that stands out like an M3 but since I have had this car I have had several people comment on what an amazing looking car I had | The people that had to inspect the car for my title told me that they where fighting for the honor to test it | Power comfort ride look and an immaculate finish to everything in this car make the price well worth it
 "words": Undoubtedly the best sedan available | The power and handling are awesome | The gas mileage is better than an Audi S4 | The silver interior is breathtaking | The voice control navigation and MMI are all very much intuitive have yet to open the manuals with questions on any | Everything is executed with class | It's not an inexpensive car but it's worth it | 
 "words": I bought my car about 2 months ago | its been a pleasure to drive it everytime I get a chance | Its fast | in control | a focal point on the road | You have all kinds of people waving you down begging you to hammer down on it so they can see it for a few seconds at least and get to hear it take off | I dont have the shaking of the steering wheel problem but my car has been consuming a lot of oil | Other than that the car is a lot of fun and for what I get back it's worth way more than what I paid | The more you push on the gas the more the engine calls for more | The S button is off the hook it sounds great | 
 "words": This is by far the best overall sports car sedan I've ever owned | The car is incredibly quick smooth and stable through all gears and under all conditions | I dare say it's even practical with a huge trunk and ample back seats for kids | Mileage isn't the car's strongest suit but in context given this car's uber performance it's quite good about 19 mpg under normal driving conditions | Excellent interior and fit and finsish | Audi did it right truly a great car | 
 "words": The RS4 is sweet its fast it corners the best and o' does it like fuel | If you ever owned a S4 you must try the RS4 | It is so much better | After 1500 miles I'm sold that this car is well worth the money | However I have 1 concern | There is a vibration in steering column at 61 65 MPH | The Audi engineers need to fix this quickly before it becomes a standard complaint about this most wounderful automobile | Congratulations Audi | you have out done yourselves | 
 "words": The title sums it all up | This is one great car | You just can't find this level of performance in a four-door AWD sports sedan | Read the glowing automotive press reviews and realize that they are not just hype | The car is really that good | Forget about the competition because this car blows them away | 
 "words": The moment I turn on the engine | wow | Sounds so solid I mean solid | Once you press the S button it sounds even sweeter | Handling is fabulous acceleration is top notch | Yes is a bit pricy but nothing compares at this moment so you pretty much have no choice | 
 "words": Yes it is worth the money | Let's get that out of the way first | The RS4 does everything my STi did and more | Considering it costs twice as much as a STi Evo it had better do more and it does | Much more comfortable and refined for daily commuting but when you get into the higher revs it's a beast | The exhaust note is amazing and there is so much torque at all rpms | Well balanced handling and it's so much easier to drive quickly thru the hills | I'm even getting the same fuel economy as I was in the STi at 18mpg 4 more cylinders 120 more horsepower just as fast and no increase in fuel consumption | Brilliant | 
 "words": My key concern when transitioning from a B5 500 hp S4 was the performance | Now after owning the car for about 1 month the performance is not my focus | The car is blazing fast | Yet Audi's execution of everything else impressed the hell out of me | The car is so solid smooth and easy to drive everyday | I can't say that about my old S4 it was getting tough | The car is much happier at 135 though really smooth | Like it wants to do 190 it's amazing | I strongly suggest the car to any modified S4 owner they won't want to go back to turbos | 
 "words": I've owned the car for just about 6 weeks and it's been all fun | There is no other car at this price that combines elite sportcar-level performance 5-passenger capability top-notch luxury features 5-star safety and all-wheel-drive | 
 "words": After multiple M3s and Porsches this car's performance and construction astound me | Brakes surreal | I feel like I just begin to think about stopping and I am there all without any complaint squeal or nose dip | Handling I pull corners and I'm amazed the car transcends all its weight and stays completely flat through the bends | The stick is the stick I had in my 911 that I was always trying to get in my M3s with trying different short shifter kits | Ergonomics the way that everything is driver centered reminds me of my old BMWs | Fit and finish has attention to every detail that I felt was there in Porsche but is lacking in most other cars | This is a four door car that has world class performance and the fit and finish that it does I don't think that there is a better buy out there | 
 "words": Driving is great except for the shaking steering wheel at 61-64 mph | The performance on this is out of the world | It must be more than 420 hp | Also the glove box opens by itself | After driving 386 miles the oil warning light came on and I checked the oil which was 1 | 5 qts low | So much for quality | Does anyone have quality control | Another RS4 at the dealership has the same vibration problem | That is two out of three that shake | Hope the engineers can figure out how to fix this | It would be bad if all steering wheels shook on this new Audi hotrod | 
 "words": This car is pure exhilaration | It is extremely quick hugs the corners and has a rock-solid build quality | The engine sounds great too | This is a fantastic every-day car and not too thirsty given its 420 hp engine | 
 "words": This car is nothing short of perfect | It's incredibly fast grips the corners and has rock solid build quality | This car is without compromise it's a rockin' sports car with an ample back seat and a huge trunk | I'm even getting decent gas mileage | I love this car |
