REVIEWS
 "words": The wife and I bought one of the original '07 FJs back in March and we love it | So far it's running perfectly | Up to 40000 miles and still not one problem knock on wood just as I expect from Toyota | Great truck | Incredibly fun to drive | Handles remarkably well for an SUV | 
 "words": I just sold my 2007 FJ | The interior is very well designed | Everything was ergonomically correct and easy to grasp with the big knobs | As many owners on here I bought the FJ because it was different | I grew tired of the vehicle after a while | Very basic interior and slightly rough ride | Not the FJ's fault | It is not supposed to be a luxury car | In three years of ownership not one day in the shop | Great build quality | Bad gas mileage | like driving a brick down the road | 
 "words": I admit it I bought the FJ Cruiser not because of the offroad capability but because I thought it was cool | After owning it for more than a year and 24000 miles it has proven to be an incredible vehicle that will do just about everything and go anywhere | It's not a race car and you can't fly around corners but it's a solid vehicle that doesn't rattle shake or shimmy like my past 6 GM SUVS have done starting at 30000 miles | It has a blind spot get ready to look around it | That's my only complaint | It gets 22 on the highway which is respectable for a 4x4 SUV | If you are looking for a solid SUV that won't break down all of the time and won't depreciate then look no further | 
 "words": My wife chose the FJ and loved driving it with our two young kids | It is easy to take them in and out of the back seat with the side-opening doors | We have the airbag package and it feels like they are in a vault | It has a hard bumpy ride as it should be because this is no grocery- getter | This vehicle is absolutely no-nonsense and reliable at 30000 mi | with no issues and none anticipated | Recently hauled three other guys for a mountain-climbing trip and the four of us were comfortable | One owns a new Jeep and lamented all the problems he is having already | We love this vehicle with no reservations and expect our kids to drive it when they turn 16 in about ten years | 
 "words": In Puerto Rico actually this is one of the best vehicles on the road | The floods and the roads here are a test for any vehicle in the market | 
 "words": I've owned 20 cars SUV's trucks | This has to be one of my 2 favorites together with my 911 cabriolet | As another reviewer said you can buy fancier much more expensive SUV's | But you can't buy one that's more fun to own that people ask you about that is this reliable that can go anywhere | I bought one of the first ones in CT Voodoo Blue and have not had a single issue | My wife 3 kids dog I all still love it just as much as new | Sure it has a few compromises like rear visibility | Show me any great car with real personality that doesn't | And this is very practical easy to clean acceptable MPG great in bad weather | and fun to own | Now that's value | 
 "words": I went to a Used Car Dealership that sold mainly Dodges | I saw this cool looking truck and learned it was called the FJ Cruiser | I test drove it and fell in love with it immediately for it's looks and above average handling for an SUV | However the clutch chirps when at idle but stops when the clutch is depressed | I had the dealership replace the clutch disc pressure plate and throwout bearing | All was well until 2 months and 1400 miles later and the same problem arose again | I learned through Toyota forums that this is an issue with manual tranny FJ's but they still operate normally as they should | Despite this somewhat major annoyance I love my FJ and don't regret buying it | 
 "words": My need for a good solid truck rules out many of the vehicles made today | I spend as much time as I can at a remote family cabin and exploring the outdoors and often am very far from any type of assistance | My vehicle needs to get me in and out and this one always comes through | I put Goodyear MTR's on it and they are top notch | I have had this vehicle in rain mud sand and lots of snow | It plows through everything without trouble | There may be more luxurious 4x4's out there but I see lots of those stuck in snow banks while the Cruiser keeps on trucking | If you go off road at all the front skid plate is not an option | While comfortable on the road it can be tricky to drive at times | 
 "words": Maybe you | re wondering why such an odd- looking SUV became my next toy after driving a 2006 Range Rover Sport Supercharged | Rather than choosing another luxury SUV I went for something different | the total opposite | A bare bones waterproofed scuba suit-covered seating Rubbermaid flooring w all-weather cargo mats an interior w a harmonious blend of nylon plastic rubber metal | Only 3200 TRD units were made I was fortunate enough to have 100 | I was always fond of the Toyota Racing Development TRD team since childhood this was one way of driving one of their latest creations just wished I could do it at the Baja but nevertheless it is fun to drive anywhere | 
 "words": I live in Alberta so the roads are black ice for 8 months of the year and it handles awesome | You have to force it to slide out in 4 wheel drive | I can drive through 2 feet of snow and not even get close to stuck | I've driven big trucks before so believe me when I say there are no blind spots just learn to use your mirrors and you can see the whole road your 6 feet off the ground | Good power I would like a v8 in it but the v6 doesn't fall far behind | Haven't had trouble fitting 5 guys and hockey bags in the back driving for over an hour | Light enough not to get stuck in mud all the time unlike older Toyota's | If you can drive you will love this SUV beats a pick up any day | 
 "words": Well I needed a vehicle that could tow my trailer of two sport bikes but didn't want a truck | When I saw the FJ I loved it | When I drove it I had to have it | The motor has sufficient power to do what you need to do | The suspension is great and was pleasantly surprised on how well it handled | The interior is roomy | However at close to 30k it lacks a few amenities that I wish it had i | e | heated seats heated side mirrors sunroof etc | Mileage is horrible but all in all it's a great vehicle and fun to drive | 
 "words": I like how it drives and handles | There are major flaws in the craftmanship though | The sun visors are so small they have no purpose | The stereo system is lacking | The roof rack is weak and I busted two supports already since they're made of cheap plastic | The engine is powerful and it is a lot of fun to drive | But the gas mileage stinks | 
 "words": I bought the FJ Cruiser after having driven a fully loaded Ford Explorer for the past 8 years | It's my first foreign car and so far I'm very pleased with it only has about 1000 miles on it at this time | I've gotten about 20 MPG on the first 3 tanks of gas with about 50 50 city highway driving | The ride feels tall but handles well and is quieter than you'd expect for a vehicle that looks this tough and is so utilitarian | I test drove the smaller Rav4 and Honda CR-V as well as the Honda Pilot and Ridgeline and Toyota 4Runner and this was by far hands down the most fun to drive | 
 "words": I have alway been a car fanatic emphasis on car | Recently I've had to curb my lectures to my wife on the negatives of SUV ownership as this new addition to our garage has pasted permagrins on both of our faces | While my '02 M3 still holds the keys to my heart I grudgingly have to admit the FJ is a more appropriate vehicle for the terrible roads and one block to the next stop sign driving of southern california | And on a friends recommendation I recently took the car to an offroad park only an hour away | This 2wd version blew me away at it's off road ability | What torque what drivability what offroad prowess | I can't wait for my next baja surf trip | 
 "words": The things I like best is that it does not have a lot of features that are difficult to use or make decisions for you | If you want to lock your doors do it radio knobs manual seats everything easy to use | It is a modern antique it is fun to drive | I find visibility not a problem | Dealer filled with regular fuel no pings using regular mileage is 20 in mixed driving | Still use regular fuel | Radio is great subwoofer is fun | Not a luxury car a fun car | I am 60 this is a car that is fun for almost anyone | Great quality | 
 "words": I've put 20000 miles on my FJ in the last 5 months and have nothing but good things to say no mechanical problems and it performs better than I could have imagined | I have taken it offroad on some of the most difficult 4WD roads in Colorado and it has performed as well as or better than my 97 Jeep Wrangler | I have been on multiple 10 hour drives and it remained comfortable to sit in although on a 5 hour trip 2 passengers in the back seat complained about the rear seats being uncomfortable | Biggest complaint is that for a professed offroad vehicle the front bumper can not accept a winch and I am replacing it with an after market steel bumper that will | Very happy | 
 "words": I purchased my FJ in January not really knowing what I was getting into | I had read all the reviews and looked at all the videos | My friends were trying to discourage me but I went ahead and got it anyway | I have to say with all my years in vehicle ownership this by far is the most well built most reliable and the best priced out of the box car I have ever owned | It drives like a car it's a beast off roading and is priced so anyone can afford it | Gas mileage could be better but the power and torque it produces outweighs it | Interior is surprisingly spacious with lots of leg room front and back | It feels like a solidly built SUV | Test drive | 
 "words": I love it | Man this this is fun to drive look at and mod | This is the best vehicle I have ever owned | 
 "words": I bought a new 73 Land Cruiser in Burlington Vermont and explored all the country around Plattsburg N | Y | and the Adriondacks | Then out to the Mojave Desert | Then back to the sand hills and mud of my home state Nebraska | I owned the LC for eleven years | In April of 2006 I purchased a fully loaded Black Cherry FJ Cruiser | I feel like I'm 20 again and once again love to be a proud owner of a Toyota | The ride and handling are excellent and with 1000 pounds of four friends the acceleration was still satisfactory | I took it out to Lake McConahy near Ogalala NE | and with 100 miles of white sand beaches and the water level way down we had a blast using the high 4x4 | FJ Cruiser good times roll | 
 "words": Love the FJ but has some blind spots while driving on and off road | 
 "words": Great handling in traffic and parking | Nice acceleration | Handles smaller than it looks | The wife loves driving it also since I installed side rails | The blind spots are what they are you adjust to it | I drove a pickup and I am used to using the side mirrors | I seem to have more a problem gauging traffic with the passenger side mirror than with any other vehicle that I have driven in the past | 
 "words": Purchased my Silver FJ Cruiser on 02 04 07 | I did a lot of research on Edmunds as well as other sites before buying | The truck is def | a head turner big powerful different | The interior has a lot of room big knobs stereo isn't too bad a lot of compartments | Sideview mirrors are a little tough to get used to but not too bad | As for the outside I love it | Older drivers might have a tough time getting in w o running boards but its def a younger person's car | Gas mileage is ok but it's a truck so you cant expect much | Overall I think it's a great buy | powerful fast durable and an attention getter | I would recommend it to anyone in the 25-35 year range | 
 "words": the FJ Cruiser handles well on the road | It has good response when you step on the gas | Also holds the road well around turns | It does not give you the feel that you are going to roll over or lose control | 
 "words": This is by far the best value vehicle on the market today | It is so fun to drive extremely rugged very well-built and has looks without comparison | There is no other vehicle on the market today that has more going for it especially at such a low price | Please just do yourself a favor no matter what other vehicle you are interested in give the FJ a try with a test drive and you will wonder why you ever even considered any other vehicle | It truly is that good | 
 "words": First I want to thank everyone who wrote a review it was very helpful in deciding to purchase my FJ Cruiser | This is one awesome SUV | comfortable great power great looks and incredible off-road capabilites | The blind spots are there but if you know how to drive with your mirrors then its not an issue | Advise for those that do not know how to use side mirrors | Place your head on the driver side window and turn the mirror until you do not see the end of the rear | On the passanger side lean over and turn the mirror out until you can not see the end of the rear | You now have no blind spots | Try it it works | I can not say enough about this SUV | Toyota out did themselves | Awesome | 
 "words": I have about 1500 miles and this engine is more powerful than I realized | I never have to break 2000 rpms generally in town it hums at 1200 rpms to 1400 rpms and that is accelerating from stop to the local speed | Gas mileage is very poor but that must be from the high compression engine | This car seems like it could use another gear which could improve mileage | Getting about 19 mpg | Can't imagine what it would be if I had a heavy foot | Women told me I looked handsome driving this car | Made my day | 
 "words": After 4 months and 7000 miles I am extremely happy with this vehicle | It has excellent power and is very quick off the line | Entering the freeway from the on ramp is a blast this vehicle flat out moves for an SUV of this type | Overall mpg city and highway combined has been 20 | 5 with premium gas | I find the steering very nimble the FJ is fun and handles well in traffic | It is also very capable off road right out of the factory | The excellent approach and departure angles helped me leave my buddies behind | Their lifted Chevy Avalanche just couldn't get in to the places I took mine | This vehicle still turns heads and gets compliments where ever I go | You can't go wrong with the FJ |

 "words": When I turned 18 I bought the FJ | I loved it for its cool design on the outside and the inside | The 4 wheel drive system is great in the snow because every wheel senses when thye are slipping and transfers more power to it also the tight ride is great for handling at high speeds |
