REVIEWS
 "words": I like this car | This is my third S Class I had a 96 and an 2002 I also owned a 745LI 2004 and I still have a 2006 750LI | Although the Big Bimmer gets it as a great performance highway car the Benz is just The Benz It is a little more supple laid back reserved | Performance when you need it and comfort for days | I don't like the AMG wheels on the sports pkg because the interior bends really easily | Also the Dunlop tires that come with it go Out of rounds So easily | I truly enjoyed it when this 2007 style came out because the 2000-2006 was way too small | The 90's model which is my favorite was dubbed Big Body for a reason | 
 "words": I have owned 3 different models of the S class since the 1999 one and this one by far tops all of them | This reminds me of the 1999 tank S class except nimbler and more sophisticated with all its electronics | The power delivery is excellent for a car its size and the interior is pure bliss | The new S class is once again the ultimate luxury sedan | 
 "words": I have owned 2 Mercedes cars in the past and by far the new S-class is the best car this company has put out | Everything in this car screams luxury and perfection | The ride is super smooth and even as the driver you feel like you're being chauffeured | The cabin is extremely quiet and the interior is designed to be elegant and clutter-free | The computer console is very intuitive and much more user-friendly than BMW's system | I've only owned the car for a week so I can not say much about the reliability | But from what I have read Mercedes has stepped up their game and this new generation of the S-class is supposed to be very well built | I own the s550 4matic an get about 16mpg in the city | 
 "words": I tried this powerhouse after driving BMW's for 10 years | More power than you will ever need 3 sets of tires in 18 months but still an MB and not a BMW in drivability | Total brake failure fluid drained out in the first two weeks didn't help with impression but it was fine after that | no maintenance issues | Front fender is ripe for destruction on high parking bumpers | Traded recently for a winter car S550 with 4Matic but will go back to an S65 or BMW 7 series soon | 
 "words": When I started driving it was very uncomfortable | When I got on the road the car started slipping | Then it stopped slipping | So I went and drove home to my hometown Chicago IL | When I arrived I turned into my street and my back wheel started drifting | It almost crashed but luckily it did't | The fuel in my tank was OK and it was better then my other car | It looks good but i will never rely on that car anymore | As soon as the weather is better I'll go and return the car | It was not ery fun to drive | 
 "words": I have owned Mercedes for the last 40 years and this car is absolutely the most poorly built and least reliable | All others were fine | With 9500 miles mine has loud squealing brakes a backup camera that is unusable due to poor optics Nav map display jumps constantly worse than my hand held 80 Garmin E-Trex | This is the most irritating item of all and Map must be turned off at night to prevent annoying distraction | The car pulls rt | on 95 of the roads | 
 "words": Got this car for one year | Computer system easy to use not like the Idrive cancelled the purchase of an M6 convertible due to this stuff | Even the night vision is usefull mostly at suset and dawn | 
 "words": This is my 4th Mercedes Benz in 5 years and happy with all of them especially the S550 class equipped with optional versatile features | I have had problems with the computers once in a while but Mercedes take cares of them well | My daily driving experience is great but you have to watch out the gas consumption especially I am driving a 4matic all wheel drive | Watch out the auto gear shifting as sometimes shifting goes to lower gear when shifting to D mode | 
 "words": The Mercedes S550 is by far the best premium luxury car in its class | It handles great looks great and is overall a really awesome car | I love driving it around town everyday and getting all the looks my children love driving it too | They say it's a chick magnet | 
 "words": Saying that the new S Class Mercedes Benz is lavish is an understatement | For me this has to be by far the best luxury sedan | I also have a 2006 750 BMW that I think its great in every sense of the word | But I like the S Class a little bit more | This is a better car than the older S Class Mercedes Benz in every possible way | It handles better rides better fit and finished the sound system navigation and all of the controls |
