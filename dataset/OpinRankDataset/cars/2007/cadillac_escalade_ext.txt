REVIEWS
 "words": The ride is much more comfortable than my GMC Denali | It handles and responds well | It has plenty of storage room | It accelerates great and corners well | I would recommend this truck luxury vehicle to anyone that asks | However it could stand some improvements to compete with the imports | 
 "words": This is my fourth EXT and by far the best | It rides like a luxury car not a truck | After 20000 miles it still rides like I just purchased it | Plaudits to Cadillac on this one | 
 "words": After 20 years of Silverados I decided to upgrade to an EXT since I've retired and don't really need a working truck any more | I'm completely satisfied with the looks performance comfort and handling | I pull a travel trailer occasionally and need the power so mileage wasn't really a concern | At this point I don't see my going to any other type if and when I purchase another one | 
 "words": Wow | What a beautiful truck | Powerful functionality as a truck but luxurious appointments all in one | The exterior turns heads and receives many compliments | But the interior is wonderful great style nice materials an incredible Bose surround sound system | Life is good in this truck | 
 "words": Very quiet and smooth | Nice new features | Lots of power | However does not feel quite as quick as my 04 EXT that only had a 4 speed automatic 345 HP | Acceleration from lower speeds feels like the engine's power is not fully making it to the wheels | Acceleration from higher freeway speeds is awsome | This vehicle does so many things well that it is hard for me to consider driving anything else | Let's see It has nice overall styling great power luxury seating interior comforts that match just about any luxury vehicle plus tremendious utility | Could use an MP3 bluetooth hook-up and more cubby storage spaces inside | Those minor things aside a safe practical vehicle for many purposes | 
 "words": The new EXT is bold and fresh | Chrome details really stick out give this vehicle a real wow factor | Not only is it fun to drive but the EXT also serves some utility features as well | The power sidesteps are pretty neat also | If you really want to stand out and drive in the lap of luxury this vehicle is for you | As far as gas mileage goes don't buy one if you will have trouble filling it up | 
 "words": Solid built truck with the luxury you can not add to any other truck | Downside is only aftermarket Bluetooth | 
 "words": this truck is lots of fun it gets up to speed like most cars so it doesnt feel like you are actually driveing a full size truck and the remote start and a c seats make summer time enjoyfull for a black on black truck
 "words": This is my second EXT and I think this truck looks and rides great | I kinda liked the body armor that the '05 had but I'll get used to it | As far as mileage you don't buy a truck like this for economy | Still Cadillac needs to stop cutting corners and go all out we will buy it even if it cost more | 
 "words": The vehicle is stunning | A real head turner | I love the ride and quietness | I previously owned two Avalanches and there is no comparison | I do miss the captain's chairs and the storage theAvalanche had with all the cubby holes etc | I don't like the center console setup of the Escalade | 
 "words": I traded in my '04 EXT for this '07 | The '07 has much better fit and finish and the new engine is very powerful | I am not crazy about the 6 speed trans | because it is always shifting and I am experiencing a severe vibration when in overdive | The dealer I bought this from has a top notch service department and they think this might have something to do with the trans | or the differential either way it only has 1000 miles on it and there shouldn't be anything wrong | 
 "words": I bought this truck just before Thanksgiving after haggling with the uncooperative dealer for a month | It was well worth the wait | It has superb styling and comfort beautiful Diamond White paint 22 wheels and best of all NO sunroof | The Escalade EXT has excellent power and great handling for a truck but terrible fuel economy | Also the lack of interior storage space is disappointing it does not even have a sunglasses holder like my Suburbans had | The console storage is very limited and anything stored in the top part is dumped around every time the lower console is accessed | It has a great instrument panel layout | The heated cooled seats are very comfortable | I love the heat for my sore old back | This truck has superb headlights and driving lights | 
 "words": The 2007 Escalade EXT is my 3rd Cadillac truck | I miss the sun visors from prior models | My 2003 had two visors with a pull out for the 3rd visor | Now there is only one and you are forced to set in a different position to keep the Florida sun out of your eyes | The tailgate is a total design flop | The painted surface sticks up higher than the black deck | If you use it as a TRUCK you will soon see all the paint gone on the edge of the tail gate | Probably like all vehicles the price went up and the quality went down hill | 
 "words": This truck is very beautiful | It makes people stare | They come up to you in parking lots and gas stations to comment on the beauty | I have a 2006 Cadillac STS V8 fully loaded and it has been parked since I got the Escalade | I am 6'5 and this truck has ample leg room and head room | It also has a great ride | I am looking forward to a road trip in the spring | This truck is beautiful versatile and powerful | I would recommend the 2007 to anyone | 
 "words": I must say I am very impressed with this truck | Although you can feel the weight behind the truck the ride comfort and performance are excellent | I love the functionality of having a truck for the occasional tow and the ability to haul the periodic large purchase | I traded my 2004 Silverado LT for the refinement of the Cadillac | Despite the fact that the two vehicles are completely incomparable the only downfall to the Cadillac is that it is too gorgeous to get dirty | The EXT is definitely a head-turner | I think GM has the most market for the high-end truck | However if the functionality of having a truck didn't prevail my wife liked the BMW X5's interior over the Escalade's | 
 "words": I have bought two new Escalades | An '02 and an '04 but I have to tell you Cadillac out did themselves with the '07's | This truck drives and handles like you cannot believe | The dealer gave me a new Escalade SUV to drive until my EXT came in two weeks later | It drove fantasticly as does my EXT | The driving experience is night and day between the earlier models and the redesigned '07 | This is my first EXT and it is a blast | I have been given a lot of nice truck comments with the SUV's but man they are coming fast and furius with the EXT | heads turning every which way | Only bad thing | I paid full list for the EXT | Ouch | Well to be the first on the block I guess you have to pay to play | lol | 
 "words": The new Cadillac Escalade EXT is the phattest Cadillac ever | It is a major upgrade over the '06 model | Everything from the styling engine and cabin is better | It's by far the hottest vehicle on the road |
