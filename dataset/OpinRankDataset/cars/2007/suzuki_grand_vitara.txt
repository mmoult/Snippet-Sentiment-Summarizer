REVIEWS
 "words": For the money you spend for a Suzuki GV it is not a bad vehicle | However because of its tendency to depreciate I would not buy one brand new | I bought my 2007 GV Xsport 2wd | barely used with 13000 mi | last year | The problem with the rear tires wearing was resolved with a rear end alignment | Seems the factory misaligned many of these models | The new tires seem to last longer once this is corrected | In my opinion most of the MPG ratings for this vehicle are pessimistic | I get around 20 MPG in city and 23 on Hwy | However this diminishes greatly if you exceed 70MPH on Hwy | The interior plastics are cheap and scratch easy but the engine and trans | seem to be very reliable and that's what counts | 
 "words": WARNING This car is a piece of junk don't dare buy one | Anyone who tries to convince you to buy this junker is pulling your leg | I bought a brand new 2007 grand vitara and I must say it is the worst car EVER | I have only had it for a little of a year and the back tires are bald with only 20000 miles on it | You feel like you are in a tin can that is bouncing around on the road | If you really want to find out how this car rides get in the back seat and let someone else drive it | You will be so uncomfortable | The leather is the very cheap stuff and you can tell just by looking at it | When you have the heat or the air on you feel like you are in a wind tunnel no kidding | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle 2 year and I must say I don't like it | Cheap plastic products used on the interiorYou can scratch the surface with your fingernail | If you have a medical skin promlem Psoriasis I would avoid bare skin contatac with the plasticIt may aggravate your condition | Fuel economy I do better with my 2000 Olds Alero comfort Rides like a pick-up truckno lumbar support in the drivers seat | 
 "words": Since I purchased my GV I've gotten married got a dog bought a house and recently became a father | All along the way the GV has never let me down | We've gone on several road trips and the GV has always been a true pleasure to drive | It now hauls my entire family including the dog with no problem | Reliability has never been an issue and the build quality is top nothch | The only issue I've had since purchasing it in 2007 has been a burned out headlight which was covered under the warranty and took a half an hour to repair at the dealership | I would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": I love the features like Smart Key that you don't find on vehicles in this class | I have one serious gripe | The mechanical valve lifters need to be serviced ever other year | I've heard it costs anywhere from 500 to 2400 out of our pockets | That's unacceptable for a modern engine | The rest of the car makers ALL use hydraulic maintenance-free lifters | My '67 Ford even had them | Suzuki saved 100 and we will be paying for it for years to come | My valves are already ticking with only 7000 miles | Also the MIL came on and the fuel gauge went to E so that's my first trip to the dealer for repair | The valve train ruins it for me | Cannot recommend this SUV for this reason | Try again Suzuki | 
 "words": Decent back and forth to work vehicle in many types of weather buts that's it | Looks good but I'm very dissappointed in fuel mileage and the shift points in the transmission | The dealer says there is nothing wrong with it | Well you travel 460 km's round trip approx 920 and spend 500 dollars in gas 497 this is ridiculous | Hauling a single axle aluminum snowmobile trailer with 2 atv's which weigh 525 lbs and 402lbs trailer might weigh in around 400 lbs | This thing is being sold | My old Ford pick-up would get better gas mileage | Very dissappointed however make sure when you ask about towing small trailers before you buy | 
 "words": Been a great truck for the blend of offroad and street driving we do | Tows our boat pretty well and does very well offroad compared to others cars in the same category I've driven | But it does ride a little more rough than say a RAV4 but it's a fair trade for more capability | The 4-mode 4wd system is pretty nice | 
 "words": Very nice compact SUV | Looks better than most of it's competitors and it also has better performance as well as more amenities than it's competitors | Handles better than a car | Very fun to drive | It can be used for towing as well as for off-roading | This small SUV is capable of taking you almost everywhere you take it | My rating for this SUV is 8 10 | 
 "words": I recently bought my GV and I love it | Lot of car for the money | Everything I wanted in a car leather sunroof heated seats mp3 alloy wheels good looking | I came across it on online and took for test drive | Needless to say I liked what I saw | Gas mileage coud be better | Factory speakers fall short but who keeps factory | Like the AWD | Comfortable seats | Needs locking gas door and lighted visor mirrors | Every time I go to my car I love the look of it | I would never have thought Suzuki for a car but I'm extremely glad I stumbled upon it on the dealer website | All around great car for the money | 
 "words": This vehicle is fun to drive and although it could use better gearing it does handle very nicely around curves and in the city | Love the real time 4x4 | Improve gearing could also improve performance during highway driving | Gas mileage is the worst feature | After almost six months of driving I have not been able to get more than 20 | 8 mpg | Built quality and seating comfort are both extremely good much better than its bigger brother the XL-7 | If it were not for the gas mileage this would be a great commute vehicle | 
 "words": All in all it's a good vehicle | Gas mileage could be a little better | The tires do roar some due to the brand Yokahoma | But so far I am impressed | I've never had a Suzuki but glad I went with the Grand Vitara | I was impressed enough with Suzuki I went out and got a Reno |

 "words": I have driven many SUVs and cars in my life and I'm 18 | This SUV is among the best small SUVs available out in the market | For the price and standard options most would be options on other automakers this is the most affordable Japanese vehicle | I own an 07 Toyota Highlander as well and compared with engine this SUV isn't the best | Highlander which is bigger in size has a larger engine more horsepower and better fuel estimates based on my driving than the Vitara | The engine on this SUV is good for the size of the vehicle but is a gas guzzler | The engine is quite loud | But everything else is very good | For what I paid it is a true bargain |
