 "words": I am not very happy with gm I bought my car used with factory warranty to 100000 mi | The car has 53000mi My transmission has been slipping I took it to dealer they didn't fix it they gave it a new gasket supposedly | tear down transmission replaced side cover gasket | I'm not happy with gm I'm going to need to keep complaining for them to fix it properly | I'm worried transmission is already on its way out it sickens i bought car 2007 used 32000 mi I luv style of car and the way it rides but I'm afraid of keeping it to long I think I have lemon signed depressed 
 "words": I have had my HHR since November 2008 bought it used with 32000 miles came with 12000 bumper to bumper warranty from chevy | The dealership will lie to keep from doing anything under warranty | My wipers have quit repeatedly during rain storms | I make an appointment to get it seen to and they lie and say they checked it out but didn't | I have two recalls for my car but the dealership wont even schedule me to get the repairs done | says I don't really need them | the car did not come with runnerboards or mud flaps so every time you drive anywhere near gravel it flies up the side of my car and skins the paint in front of the back door and the warranty doesnt take care of that either 
 "words": Has a good road feel and drives well predictable positive handling | Mileage around 27 winter and 31 in the warmer months | Avg'd over 35 on a 1000 mile road trip last summer | Nice smooth powerband but 2 | 2 won't snap your head back on inclines | Utility is well designed with the plastic floor and sides rear seats that fold flat | Rear seat leg room adequate comfortable | Driver's leg room a little narrow but sliding the seat back helps | Telescoping wheel would be a good overall remedy for this | Engine is nice if you do you own basic maint | Oil changes a snap with that top load filter plugs easy access fluid fillers like that | Good daily runner | Economical practical comfy | 
 "words": I have had my used HHR which by the way I just found out means Heritage High Roof for 13 months | It does have a high roof but you can't see out the windshield very good at a red light | All in all I really like the car I hope I am not jinxing myself the other members of my family always want to drive my car instead of their own | My mother can get in and out of it with no problem which is a problem in other cars | I have always owned a van and at first I thought WOW how small but I just went on a camping trip and was able to get everything in comfortably | I wish it had roof racks though | I have recommended this car to friends and family because of the price and reliability so far | 
 "words": I started shopping for a roomy vehicle that i could afford and could afford to run | I didn't have the need for speed or a handling package since most of the work the car would be doing would be on the interstate | With the HHR I feel I hit the transportation jackpot | I regularly fit a string bass 2 amps several guitars a sax or 2 and three humans inside fairly comfortably | Over the life of the car so far I am AVERAGING 29 | 9 mph | Fully loaded on the hiway I've never done worse than 33 | 5 mph | Splitting the gas 3 ways at todays gas prices that works out to about 2 cents mile | The HHR is quiet comfortable and very reliable | Easy to drive a great turning radius and very easy to park | 
 "words": Bought my 07 HHR new in 2007 | By the time 2008 rolled around it was worth about 10K less than the sticker price on a trade | The car was much better built then my 2004 Cavalier | but that does not say much | In my 20 months of ownership I had multiple electrical issues suspension problems and fuel mileage down to under 23mpg consistently | It looks more spacious then it really is | I would be more likely to recommend this vehicle as a used car | don't get suckered in to buying a new one because it drops in value sooooooo quick you can't get your dollar's worth out of it before it will be off the road | My summary Decent car don't forget that you are buying a Chevy and it will cost you | 
 "words": I love my HHR | I've had it just over two years and it has a little over 20000 miles on it | I haven't had any major problems with it | I did have some brake squeak when it was new and that was fixed | I still get compliments on my HHR | Most people are surprised when they get in at how much room it has | Especially when I haul something in the back they never think it will fit and it surprises them when it does | I get great gas mileage 30-33 on the highway and 25-30 in town it just depends on how big a hurry I'm in | My Mom is considering an HHR for her next vehichle | 
 "words": I've owned over 15 new years in my life and this is the first one that has absolutely no defects whatever | I just past my 36000 mile warranty and no issues | The car is fun to drive holds a ton of stuff gets really good mileage I routinely get 30 mpg city highway mix and the quality is what Chevrolet should be doing with all their cars | Tight solid no squeaks | The paint is as shiny as when new | Tires wear evenly | Transmission shifts smoothly and acceleration is more than adequate for a small engine | I wish the resale value were a bit higher but heck I' m not selling it so I suppose it doesn't matter that much | 
 "words": I really love to drive my HHR LT but the exterior body has gotten really bad | I live on a gravel road and the the rims are flaking off and I have absolutely no paint left in front of my rear wheel wells | It is starting to rust all ready and I have under 28000 miles on it | Took it back to dealer at under 10000 miles and they really didn't care | Have replaced the sway bar links already too | Just a cheap car | Gas mileage should be better than 25 average but it's not | Bad handling in winter conditions also should be noted | 
 "words": We absolutely loved our HHR Panel LT with its retro design | White with floor boards heated leather seats etc | Before the cowl seal leak that flooded the passenger side floor board and soaked the carpet with 3 inches of rain water | It was fixed according to the local Chevy service department under warranty but who knows | will it leak again | the thought of another rain water leak makes me sick | Fell out of love fast | 
 "words": I have had my Sunburst Orange HHR for 7 months now | It sure gets a lot of looks | The pickup is great and it handles well 3 seasons of the year | I have 3 complaints though | It does not handle very well in the snow | important feature up here in Canada The cupholders and electric window buttons are awkward to reach | Other than that I absolutely love this car | 
 "words": I love this car | I consistenly get 26 | 5 miles to a gallon around town and on the freeway | My average speed in use is 30 mph | I roll it at 70 on the freeway and combined with my street level average 30 mph | Handy layout lets me haul large items | Plenty of pep in small engine | 
 "words": Surprise | The off the line power is great | The interior comfort is super | The quality is great in and out | Get the mud flapsor the dirt will hit the vehicle | This replaced a Land Rover and I am not looking back |

 "words": From the first time I saw an HHR on the road I wanted one | Now the proud owner of a bright orange eye catcher I can tool around town in style and hit the open road with pride | After six kids and 22 years of marriage i finally found the car suv that the kids like and my wife wants to drive more than me | My recomendation | buy one | Heck | buy two | 
 "words": I have only owned my HHR about 3 months but the gas mileage is very good | The look of the vehicle is very appealing and gets lots of attention | It is a fun little vehicle to drive | I feel very safe and comfortable when I drive it | The only thing I could possibly think that might improve it would be repositioning the cup holders | I am not sure where but they are awkward to reach | 
 "words": I didn't like the HHR when it hit the road | I went with a friend to help him buy a car and test drove the HHR | 2 hours later I was driving out with it | He bought also | Great car | I bought the LT with the 2 | 4 engine | 
 "words": Bought '07 HHR LT fall limited edition | Love it | The black chrome looks great | Very comfortable great mileage | I am 6' and there is a lot of room | Handling is great not too much body roll | It is a lot of fun | Rides like a much more expensive car | 
 "words": I bought my 2007 HHR sight unseen just because I loved the exterior styling so much | I hadn't even driven one until I took it off the dealer's lot | I knew from the first moment after that point that this was going to be an automobile that I would love and I do | The smooth and quiet ride I would dare say is compariable to more expensive luxury vehicles and the attention to detail in the manufacturing shows | Fuel economy is excellant averaging 34 MPG I can now go as long as two weeks between fueling and I travel a good distance to my job | 
 "words": Roomy and comfortable when driving long distances | Good gas mileage | Rear area is roomy and the shelving for storage is excellent | 
 "words": At first I wasn't a big fan of the looks of the car but after getting to know the car in and out I really love it | The HHR is fun to drive has a ton of great features and I now love how it looks | For the price I don't think there's a better vehicle out there | 
 "words": HHR is definitely a car worth your attention | It runs very smoothly and quietly gives you great gas mileage 30 miles highway plus local in my case and plenty cargo space | My HHR has a 2 | 4-liter engine for which premium gas is recommended you can still use other grades but later on your engine may need to be serviced | I've noticed that whenever I'm driving up-hill I really need to push the paddle to maintain the same speed | The only thing I don't like at all about this vehicle is the little compartment space | My previous car is a Geo Prizm much like Toyota's Corolla which is quite smaller than HHR | But Prizm has more space where I can put CD's maps stuff like that | 
 "words": This car is certainly not a race car but I didn't want that anyway | It's fun to drive has a very comfy ride looks nice and seems to be built very well | I have had many cars domestic and foreign | I would have to say this car is as nice and built as well as any foreign car | Very happy
 "words": As a Suburban owner I was taken by the design of the HHR | Being an Old Guy I love the '49 Suburban take | Also I like the fact that the seating position is high and entering and exiting this vehicle is easy | I don't feel like I'm sitting on the floor boards | The build and quality of this vehicle is as good as I've seen on any US vehicle | Maybe it's because it's assembled in Mexico | At any rate they're doing it right | I should say at this point this report is on the 2LT with the 175 horsepower 2 | 4 liter engine | The 2LT isn't an option listed above for some reason | The 2LT has a larger sway bar and stiffer suspension | It handles way better almost like a sports car | 
 "words": 2007 HHR sure beats the 2004 Freestar | The ride is at least as good performance is about the same MPG is about double and it's twice the fun to drive and most people love the looks | I sure do enjoy it
 "words": There is no comparison between the HHR and the PT Cruiser | The HHR is roomier more economical and better looking | I average 29 | 5mpg cruising at 75mph in hilly West Virginia | The back is large enough with the floor removed to fit a full size contradrum corp standing up | I love my HHR |

 "words": I received my HHR on a Friday and was just starting to explore all the features when 4 days later on Tuesday a gentleman ran a stop sign and I hit him going about 30-35 miles per hour | It was a very scary few minutes | I never even had time to hit the brake | No one was severely injured | I got out of my vehicle and walked away with only the injury from the seatbelt | The air bag also went off | The windshield never broke | There was no damaged from the front seats to the back of the vehicle | The front end took the whole impact of the crash | My truck was totaled though | It only had 345 miles on it | With the 5 star safety rating and my proof of it I'll be buying another HHR |

 "words": We have the LT but even the LS has lots of goodies for the price | Features not even mentioned include speed sensitive windshield wipers traction control included if you get the ABS brakes option nicely tinted windows and a drivers information display on the speedo | 
 "words": I wanted to get rid of my gas guzzling SUV but needed the room of a station wagon and this was it | I am 6' tall and found this to have the perfect legroom and headroom I was looking for | Plus it had all the features I wanted at a very reasonable price | I wasn't looking to be the first one off the line at the light you won't win any races but the HHR runs travels and handles well | I've been in the automotive business mechanical and body shop for 26 years and I am quite pleased with my purchase of the High Roof | 
 "words": I just drove the HHR home last night nearly 150 miles in the dark | The displays were easy to read and use I was driving through a lot of hills with a lot of curves and it handled great | I kept feeling like I was in my truck but lower | Fuel mileage came out to 28mpg | That's twice what my truck got | 
 "words": After a year of ownership my complaints are few | I had a convertible before but needed a practical car | The HHR fits the bill to a tee | It consistently gets mileage in the 30's with the 2 | 4 liter and the 5 speed manual the car is quite responsive | I wish the car had traction control since corrected I hate the cup holders and the window switch location also since fixed All in all this car is for an active person who doesn't want their car to look like everything else on the road | 
 "words": We have an LS with the 2 | 2L automatic | Highway gas mileage is excellent about 32-35mpg | City mpg about 23- 25mpg | Only complaint is the cup holders are not user friendly for the driver or the passenger | Otherwise we love our HHR | Excellent headroom and we love the retro styling of the interior | Great ride quality with little to no cabin noise | Visibility out the front windshield takes a bit of getting used to but after a while you don't even notice | All in all a great car | We would recommend this car to everyone | 
 "words": I'm very happy with the HHR however I am from the northeast and this winter has been very cold | The reason I bring the weather up is in the morning when I get on the hughway the engine is quite loud | Getting to the highway I have a little dip or two to go over | When I do go over them it sounds like I lost my under carriage | After like five miles this to calms down | The car has a low front end so stay on well plowed roads | 
 "words": I actually love the car the ride the the mileage all fine | But after a year and 9 months I had to take it into the dealer to have rust repaired on all 5 doors | The rust is in the doors where the seams are | If you look at the seam in the bottom of the doors you can see the rust bubbling under the paint | I took the car in and they sandblasted the door seams and repainted | I know a good deal about cars and I know for certain this car had to be assembled rusty | I don't mean to pile on when GM is down but maybe this is why | I spoke to my neighbor who owns an HHR who was not surprised because his doors had also been repaired for rust | Is GM building Vegas again | Just a word to the wise | 
 "words": I bought my LT a couple of months ago used with 35K miles I have already put 10K miles on it and I have to say unless mechanical problems arise to dampen my enthusiasm I absolutely love this car | It is comfortable and roomy even for a large person like me quiet zippy yes it really is even with the 4 cyl | the heater rocks and will fry your face off from a cold start in less than 3 minutes usually more like 1 minute in Texas winter | Love the sunroof love the styling love it all | Wish I had gotten a lighter color I have the darker red exterior and darker color interior though | Almost my favorite car I've ever owned | Still partial to my old Grand Prix GT | 
 "words": I love my HHR | I do a lot of driving and it is great for long trips | The sound is very nice and the 2 selling points for me are the curves and the leg head room | I am 6 foot 2 and have no problems at all | I love to keep it waxed but I do not have running boards and due to the design the front tires kicks up stones and gravel to the point that the paint is destroyed infront of the rear tires | Chevy repainted it once but did not offer to put on the running boards | I am not happy that i have to sell it but it does not drive very well in the snow | I have to get a 4x4 | 
 "words": HHR is definetely a summer car not a winter car | Ice gets between the bottom of lower front fender and door and freezes up preventing us from getting in and out of car | Outside of that it has been a great car my average MPG is 27 | 
 "words": I recently bought the Chevy HHR my driving experiance with the car is just awesome | It handles just like a high end sports car ride is so comfortable | I took it twice too Little rock ark | from ft | myers fla 1200 miles each way the fuel economy is great averaging 29 to 31 hwy miles | I have the royal blue metallic | it has just the right amount of chrome to set it off and turn heads | The only drawback is where they put the power window controls | You have to take your eyes off the road to find them | If anyone wants a truly great auto in a small SUV try this one you will not be disappointed | More than plenty off horsepower and comfort and leg room | Get this one it's great
 "words": I have the 2 | 4 L larger 4 cyc engine which is fun | I have a white with the chrome package with it decked out except it has gray material seat | It gets between 25 32 | 5 mpg so that is wonderful for commuting | 
 "words": I have almost had 3 wrecks due to the blind spot dealing with the windshield pillars | They are very thick for such a small vehicle | The windshield needs to be bigger when I put the visor down I have to slump down in the seat to seat under the dumb thing | GM did move for 2009 the window controls to the door they are a pain in front of the gear shift | The cup holders are too close together so you cannot have to larger cokes in them and then the armrest are in the way to get to your drink | It needs to have a console and lots more cubby holes | There is a lot of space that is wasted that could have been utilized for storage | The storage in the door is way to small needs to accomodate drinks
 "words": Liked the retro look from when I first saw the concept car always been a Chevy fan but only owned their trucks 3 4 ton HD all my cars had been imports | I traded in a CRV for this car because it was the most car for the money period | We saw an ad price for 12500 for the LS and with my GM card discount we drove home in it for 11500 brand new | cheaper than a cobalt or focus or a less equipped hyundai | We love that the base model has so many features standard | Oh and did I mention how great the mileage is | We average 36 on trips and have on one trip gone over 600 miles on one tank | For snow we bought Bridgstone Blizzack studless and they are amazing | No need for AWD 
 "words": I love this car | I'll admit at first I was not excited about it because I don't think it's the most attractive of vehicles on the outside but once I stepped inside I fell in love | I got used to the outside and the only thing Also I don't know what everyone's talking about with their car being in the shop | I travel everywhere with this car almost had it for a year and driven over 10000 miles and it's still going strong with no problems | Though I did get in one accident and my car had the slightest dent scratch on it while the other was nearly totaled | So it's a pretty tough car | 
 "words": Love my HHR and I won't give it up but I hate that it has been in the shop so much | It is a blast to drive especially since mine has the 2 | 2 with a 5-speed transmission | Great fuel mileage average 27 mpg daily driving and 33 mpg on highway | Items replaced thus far upper and lower steering shafts front brake rotors and brake pads radio three times front sway bar bushings and body control module related to radio issues | Running boards and Splash guards are a must if you experience winter driving conditions protects paint on rear doors | Changed tires to Goodyear TripleTreads Original Firestone Affinity tires were junk and I now have better control handling and traction | 
 "words": This vehicle has been a mileage surprise | EPA estimates of 30 are often exceeded on longer trips | A recent 400-mile one-way trip got 31 mpg with several in town stops while the return mostly non-stop trip logged 34 | 5 on the onboard computer but 39 mpg when actually running the numbers on the calculator | This was at 59-60 mph for most of the way | This replace a 1994 S-10 Blazer that only did 24 mpg on its best days | I wish professional reviewers would quit putting so much emphasis on a vehicle's ability to rocket off the line | Except for race car drivers we are not buying cars to win drag races | The HHR has plenty of power to accelerate from stop lights and to merge onto freeways | 
 "words": I have owned mine for about a month now | I love it | I did read the reviews prior to purchase so some small things I agree with | The door locks why are they so tall | Makes hard to have your arm on door | Also interior easily staining is so true | I mean water on seats stained and that is so odd to me | I was frustrated as my car didn't come with trunk mat | I did shop around | The dealear wanted 104 | for the rubber mat | I actually found a lot of them on ebay for 49 | So check that out if you need one | Other than that all is great | I dont see any issues | Everyone loves it and my kids finally have room to relax | Great car don't hesitate | 
 "words": Car has proven to be very reliable | I have total confidence in the ecotec motor and GM transmission | Car is well built and everything fits no rattles | You cannot hear or feel the motor inside the car | Car is quiet at speed and at idle | Handling is pretty good | I love the cargo utility the fold down seats I use it quite often | Very little maintenance is required | I had a few small problems with brake drums and vibration when I first got vehicle | Dealer fixed it all promptly and professionally | This is the first ever GM product I purchased new | I have no regrets satisfied with my choice and recommend the HHR highly if you are looking for a small efficient family utility vehicle
 "words": My HHR has been in the shop 13 times in past year | I would be driving down the road and it wold just shut off | Burning smell all kinds of electrical problems | Before 7K miles it had to have new bearings | It was in the process of Lemon Law and 1 week shy of owning it a year caught on fire while I was driving and burnt to the ground | I was lucky my children weren't with me | Gas mileage started out good almost 30 on the hwy and then went to no better than 21 | Bought it for gas mileage and safety | I guess they failed on both | 
 "words": I have had my HHR for over a year now and the odometer is telling me that I am using 6 | 9 liters of fuel for 100 kilometers | That equates to 41 MPG city and highway combined | Wow | More than expected | I get people asking me all the time about the color | Golden Teal Metallic | GM only made this colour for the 2007 model year | 
 "words": I like this car very much | It rides well and is quiet with the windows up | No road noise | Gas mileage is high 20's in city | I would buy another | 
 "words": I have had my HHR over 1 year and have put about 30000 miles on it | I have been averaging about 33 mpg that is city highway combined | When I first saw it I really wasn't that excited about the looks of it | But I decided to take it for a test drive because of the sticker price | Once I did that was all it took | It was so much fun to drive I am a very large person and fit in that vehicle comfortably | 
 "words": I love this car | I get 29 mpg | I do a lot of highway driving and when the windows are closed it seems like its sound proof | I could use a little more light being that the windows are tinted and small it doesn't flood the vehicle with light | The one thing I do hate is that the cup holders are between the seats and the power window buttons are next to the shifter on the floor | I have actually been thinking about an upgrade to a 08 | 
 "words": This car is a fleet vehicle for the company I work for | I have put on about 50k miles on it in the first year so far and have had no problems at all mechanicaly | The engine is suprisingly quick for a 4 cyl | My only complaint is the seats | They stain way too easy | I spilled a bottle of water and it left a stain | I have the gray interior | I would reccomend black or get leather | All other features about inside are great | 
 "words": Over all not too bad of a vehicle | It would be nice to be driving something where I was not surrounded by plastic when I was inside | I usually get much better then the rated gas mileage around 38 mpg highway if I watch my speed | 
 "words": I bought my HHR for my wife in 2007 for a nice car to drive back and fourth to work | Mileage has been solidly in the upper 20s with mixed city HWY | When we are on the open highway I have gotten as good as 33 but stick around 31 most of the time | The car is solid it is just a base but the auto start was a deal setter for my wife | Great little car | But just a few weeks ago i got a safety recall on the little beast | Come on GM get your heads in the game | This final recall is the last nail in the coffin for my GM purchasing days | I just bought a Ford fusion for myself | And my wife pretty much stole it from me | Looks like GM just can't seem to build something with out needing to recall it | 
 "words": We like driving this HHR | It hasn't given us problems execpt for front rotors | They were turned twice and finally replace at 15000 miles | Not good prefomance when the Rav4 we traded in hadn't been touched in 60000miles | The dealer screws you around saying the rotors are still within tolerance even though when they're turned they warp faster next time | GM doesn't seem to want to admit they have a problem | 
 "words": Havent owened a car suv in over 10 years | We own a Suburban now but the poor thing dosent get drove any more | All Ive evered owned is trucks and a few Suburbans | We fell in love with the HHR on our first test drive with in 4 miles | I'm 6 foot tall and this thing has more room than my trucks | It's so easy to get into and out | Great job GM | The fuel mileage is great the ride is also great | The main thing I love is my wife is right by my side | With all my trucks and the burb you have to much room between you | I love to reach out and touch her without taking my eyes off the road | Im sure this will not be my last HHR | 
 "words": I thought I loved my car | I have now owned it about 8 months | The paint is chipping my power steering has gone out the traction was horrible this winter and when more than 1 window is down there is a suction almost | There are several things that I do like but I don't believe my vehicle should be having problems yet and I am upset that's why I bought a new vehicle to not have problems for reliability | 
 "words": I had admired the HHR for some time and finally took the plunge | It's a great car with everything you could want | Styling is exceptional it's fun to drive it's comfortable with great mileage | When I test drove the vehicle I have to admit I felt a bit claustrophobic what with the huge windshield pillars and dark tinted glass but soon got used to it | The large mirrors compensate quite well for any blind spots | My only complaints are the front brake rotors are too light for the car and front end needed work at 29000 miles which the dealer performed under warranty | Overall I am thrilled with the car | 
 "words": I have the 5 speed manual 2 | 2 liter engine | I get far better mileage than the EPA estimates | Around town I get around 28 mpg and on trips I get 36 38 mpg | Its a terrific vehicle and I am totally satisfied with it |
