REVIEWS
 "words": I just purchase my first BMW 2007 550i I test drove the 528 and did not like the lack of power | The 550i is a BEAST and is a dream to drive I can't stay home I take the longest way home and the acceleration is orgasmic | I will never drive another car other than a BMW | Worth every penny | Not sure what my gas mileage will be yet but so far not bad for a V8 engine | 
 "words": Wow what fun to drive | I wish I had the extra power of the 550 or the 535 but this car has it when you need it | I like to drive it in Drive Sport as it really hugs the road and gives me the extra boost of speed | 
 "words": Bought my Certified Pre-Owned with 18K miles | Mileage is only mentioned a few times in the reviews so I thought I would confirm the reports of excellent mileage | I'm getting 24 | 5 to 25 | 5 around the Wash DC beltway about 70 30 highway streets | I'm looking forward to a road trip to confirm the high highway reports | The comfort of the seats is also amazing | 
 "words": Best car I have ever owned and truly a pleasure to drive | I commute 100 round trip daily and I look forward to driving this car even after 3 years and 55k miles | Corners like a dream gets up and goes fast enough but keeps you out of trouble | I have every option available except the night vision and active cruise control | You must have the sports package as the looks and performance can't be matched | Bought this car new with only 3 miles on it | 
 "words": This is really a great car | It has so many features even after having it for a couple of months I'm still finding new features all the time | I just found that there are 2 compartments in the arm-rest | I've been told the lower compartment is to keep drinks cool | This car drives great is very comfortable and smooth and with all it's function it looks great too | I've driven a 3 series before but with 2 kids and car seats the 5 series is definitely the right size | 
 "words": Just got a CPO with 28K miles | Drives like a dream | I opted for the sport pkg with no regrets | The only glaring disappointment was the Logic 7 Sound system which leaves a lot to be desired | My Civic SI factory upgrade system was better | For a lux car that retails for 60k new the Logics 7 system should rival Acura but falls far short on fidelity plus a boomy bass | Too bad for such a quiet car | 
 "words": There is much to like about this car | Performance styling and reliability | It also seems to maintain value | There are some frustrating features on the car the iDrive takes some getting used to | Something that should be simple like tuning the radio switching from CD to radio even the climate control has been in my opinion over-engineered | Often multiple steps are required to perform a function that could be more easily done with the turn of a knob | The sun roof is very noisy after the sale the rep | said all 5-Series have excessive wind noise when closed | I usually just keep the interior cover closed to avoid the noise | Interior cabin storage is non-existent but the trunk is large | 
 "words": I purchased my 2007 530i new 2 years ago | I traded my 2004 530i in when I reached 45K miles | I have not been disappointed with either of these cars | The handling comfort and power are great | I test drove a 2004 525 when I was first looking because the dealer had one with the Sport Package but I chose the larger engine and didn't regret my choice | The 50K no charge warranty is great but honestly the dealer makes things up so they can fix my car e | g | change the wiper blades etc | I have not had any real issues with my cars | 
 "words": Just bought this car about two weeks ago and I love it | Just a beautiful car | Drove Hondas and Toyotas before and no comparison | I can see why people stay with BMW | The car just feels well put together | It feels solid on the road | I got the sport package and I like the wheels and seats that come with it | Great handling and acceleration although there is a little lag when you punch it which probably wouldn't be an issue with the V8 | Fuel economy however is very good for this type of car | 
 "words": I purchased this car last year so far it has only been back to the dealer for the free maintenance | I live in snowy Canada so a car that handles well in snowy weather is important this car was absolutely exceptional last year | Performance balance and handling are superb | The xi add on is well worth it | Last winter was a very heavy snowfall winter and I drove the car without snows it drove like it was on rails some of the roads were unplowed slippery and the car handled it without a problem it gives you a great feeling of safety and it has not let me down yet | 
 "words": Being military overseas in Germany I was able to purchase our New 5 series at well below what the U | S dealers ask | My wife and I saved thousands and were able to get the 525xi with all the toys and luxury items we wanted and deserved | This car is awesome | The mileage this weekend touring Germany got us 30 | 9 MPG | 
 "words": I have owned 5 other BMWs including a 7 series | This is the best one I have had from an all around driving experience | The 6 cylinder has outstanding acceleration not much different from the 550 I test drove | Gas economy is amazing for this kind of car | Handling is fantastic and overall ride is close to perfect | I convinced my 82 year old dad to buy one and he now feels the same way
 "words": When you drive this BMW you know that a great deal of effort went into every facet of the automobile | The way each sound the reaches your ears and the car reacts to bumps and especially the way it drives down the road | I've had this car for about 18 months and 16000 miles | Each mile is a pleasure and every drive is too short | X-drive is great in snow and rain i-drive is still revealing new functions but works well for me but the standard radio is just ok | Standard seats are comfortable for hours on end | Highway driving is smooth and quiet very easy to cruise at high speeds | I've leased this car and really do not want to ever give it back | Just do it you only live once | 
 "words": Definitely the best vehicle I have ever owned | I used to drive Hondas and Toyotas but owning a 5 series really opened my eyes to the reasons that make so many people want to keep buying these even with a hefty price tag | 
 "words": Outstanding vehicle | Fun to drive and great fuel mileage | Only gripes are the cup holder and ability to see front and back of the car in tight areas | Kudos BMW | 
 "words": This car is unique and I cannot describe how you feel when you drive it | You must own one and drive it on a regular basis to understand | 
 "words": Sadly our first BMW only went 20K before being involved in a driver's front end collision last week | Damage was so severe the car was totaled | It did its job however as the front door and side curtain air bags all deployed and kept the wife protected with no major issues | BMW Assist was calling the car within seconds of the accident as well as calling the police | Overall it was a well built car and we had no major problems with it | The brake issue I mentioned in my previous posting never returned | We are now looking at an 08 528i or 535i with the turbo | The 07 held its value fairly well | In the 18 months we owned the car the value dropped 28

 "words": Overall the car is great | This was our first BMW | Nice looks nice interior comforts | Very nice leather | My only complaint so far is with the brakes | An annoying squeak develops when the front brakes get the slightest amount of dust on them | I did not expect this from a 50K car | Also when I have the steering wheel and seat in a position I like I cannot see the upper portion of the speedometer We are happy with the car | The ride is amazing | At high speeds in the rain it handles very well | Recently got a road force balance on the tires and that made the ride much better We purchased the car in black | I would not own another in black | Hard to keep clean | 
 "words": Probably the finest car I have ever owned | Fun to drive great engineering and outstanding performance | Highly recommend to anyone | 
 "words": Over the years I've owned many BMW products | 7s 5s X5s 2002 and on and on | None of them can match this particular car | it is truly incredible | At first I was not sure about the Bangle styling but I have to admit that as the car has aged it has really grown on me and I now love the styling | It will run with a Porsche 911 without problem and on a cruise from Florida to Michigan it was superb | The car is almost a year old and has never had a single problem nor been back to the dealership | To quote Lee Iacocca if you can find a better car buy it | 
 "words": I bought this car after owning other luxury cars | It outranks the others by far | The handling and solid ride speaks volumes | The downside is it is so smooth on the open road you have to watch the speed it is moving faster than it feels | Quality and handling along with style | One small issue is that the cup holder needs to be re-designed it's not in a good place | I am totally sold all my cars in the future will be BMW | 
 "words": I'm a long term Audi owner have had six who decided to look around when they dropped the free maintenance | I test drove the new Audi A6 wagon and the BMW 530xiT | The BMW did just about everything better than the Audi and the monthly lease rate was better | The choice was a no-brainer | The 530xiT ride and handling are first rate as is the build quality | The engine is exceptionaly smooth but could use a bit more low end torque | Winter performance especially with snow tires is exceptional | The iDrive is not as scary as expected but could be better | I like my BMW so much that we replaced my wife's Audi with a BMW 530xiT too | 
 "words": This is my 9th BMW and I am pleased that BMWs have not lost their edge | Great handling adequate power I miss the torque from the MB E500 I had very good build quality | The car is a roomy 4 door sports car | The 255 BHP 6 is good but torque is a little low and you tend to be aware that the 6 speed auto is being used rather a lot | I get a little hesitation when I make a sudden demand for acceleration which can be a little disconcerting | Sports package worth the money for the contour seats alone | They are the most comfortable seats in the business | Fuel economy is excellent | Superb car worthy of the BMW name | Just annoyed that BMW introduced the 300 BHP engine just after I purchased my car |

 "words": After driving everything in the luxury sedan market in the 45-65K range this car won me over | Unlike the Lexus GS 350 this car has a real trunk way more fun to drive than anything in its price range | The hushed cabin at high speed puts Lexus and Infinti to shame combined with incredible handling | Don't pass up the chance to try one of these cars | Thumbs way up |

 "words": This car is the best handling and nicest car I have owned | It is smooth when accelerating and the handling is impressive | The navigation is solid and I did not personally have a issue with the iDrive system | Anyone with computer mouse experience and the ability to conquer Microsoft Windows will find the iDrive system easy to use | My only advice is to stay away from the Performance Package with the run flat tires if you don't want to feel like your running over a speed bump by just running over a cigarette butt | 
 "words": I was set to buy a Lexus GS 300 AWD until I drove the 530xi | It is a great but expensive car | Also drove the Audi A6 Infiniti M35AWD and Acura RL | The handling is superb and the attention to detail is appreciated | Long live iDrive for me it is like using a mouse or joystick | No more fumbling for the correct button or the proper position on a touch screen | Should have listened to the owners' forums and ordered the Head Up Display | 
 "words": The car is solid but the front seat is a bit deep and the back of your legs at the knee will touch the seat and forces you to slouch forward for clearance or inflate the lumbar support feature to move you forward and clear the behind the knee issues | You see for a 5'7 adult like me and my wife is 5 foot even the rear seats are too deep and makes small adult legs float and not reach the carpet which makes your legs numb after awhile | But the car is solid handler so it washes out |
