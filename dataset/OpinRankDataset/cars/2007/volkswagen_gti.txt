REVIEWS
 "words": The 2007 GTI is a very well made car the only significant repair after 90K miles was rear wheel bearings | There was also a problem with the PCV valve which was fixed under a service bulletin | The car also loses or burns some oil not unexpected for a turbo I guess but you must check the oil regularly | Numerous interior squeaks and rattles were corrected after I replaced the horrid stock Continental tires with BFG SuperSport A S and then Goodyear Eagle GT A S | Ride and handling are great the stability control is excellent | No steering feel due to the electric steering but you learn to live without it | An almost perfect practical sporty 4- dr hatch at a reasonable price | 
 "words": Its just a fine piece of engineering | This car feels absolutely solid and locked on to the road | Driving becomes more intuitive when the car goes exactly where you point it when you point it | Anyone who has ever driven an American car should be familiar with the amount of sag or 'play' between the actual motion of the steering wheel and whats transmitted to the wheels | That's what makes German cars so awesome wheels turn with the drivers hands | The DSG is just about the most underrated technological innovation ever | This trans is a blast blowing through gears at speeds previously unimaginable for any gearbox | Learn about how the dual clutch works its worth the education | 
 "words": My GTI has been with me for two years and 17K miles and the experience has been positive | This is the original hot hatch the benchmark for this class | If you're looking for outright performance go for a Mazdaspeed 3 | But if you're seeking European character and sophistication the choice is clear | The GTI goes about its business in a most German way | Feels solid as a bank vault when you get in and shut the door | On the interstate it's unflappable and deceptively fast so invest in a good radar detector | This model has ceased production as the sixth-generation is already out and headed to the US in the fall of 2010 | There should be many pre-owned examples to choose from | 
 "words": My '07 GTI is the most enjoyable new car I have ever owned | It's the perfect size and I've got plenty of space for people and cargo too | VW styling never gets old and the retro interior is cool comfortable and durable | The DSG is best auto-manual transmission ever made | It makes the car feel sporty without making me feel tired | It's a sports car that doesn't beat you up | But stick to the base car and skip the leather package | Otherwise you have a 30K GTI | 
 "words": I bought the GTI to have a fun car to drive while still being able to live with it day by day | It has more than enough power for the street | Quick steering and an easy to use 6-speed gear box but the clutch travel is long | There is a huge aftermarket to tweak the car to exactly how you want it | Fits four people with ease | The hatch is a bit small compared to my last car's trunk but cavernous once the rear seats fold down | Adequate 6-disc CD stereo for a non-audiophile | I've had no mechanical problems | The biggest problem with owning the car is how expensive maintenance can be especially if down at the dealer but the recommended 10000 miles between oil changes helps with that | 
 "words": I've had my GTI for almost two years now and it's easily the finest car I've ever driven | There were so many duds that followed the 1983 original but Volkswagen finally got serious again about this iconic model | The engine is the star here propelling what's not a light vehicle with gusto | It pulls from below 2000 rpm which means there's virtually no turbo lag | Great car for darting around Manhattan traffic but the open road is where it shines | Buckets of torque make passing a breeze and the VW is unflappable at high speed | Overall reliability has been surprisingly solid | Fuel economy has been atrocious | 
 "words": I have owned this car for 2 years now | This has been overall the best car I have ever owned and I have owned a lot of vehicles over the last 40 yrs of driving | The quality is exceptional and the driving puts a smile on my face every time I drive it | The fun factor and mileage make it a 10 | 
 "words": The GTI is amazing | gets better with age | Perfect for urban areas park it anywhere | Equally at home ripping down curvy country roads in the mountains or cruising on the highway | Equipped with winter wheels tires roof box it easily can take four skiing or riding | Cruising range over 400 miles-fill ups are infrequent | VW put the money where it counts in this new gti | The handling is crisp and predictable | Squirt through some traffic and take the exit a little faster or go for a Sunday drive and enjoy motoring with the windows down and sunroof open | Sound and options could be better | If you can only own one car this is it | buy it used and save some | Fun and reliable | kids luv it | 
 "words": This car is fun in every way and has all the little features that make it feel more expensive than it is | The engine is so torquey I never wanna drive a VTEC again | Perfect gear ratios in the 6 speed | Makes my 20 mile daily commute fun | Your car should be fun | 
 "words": This car is outstanding | I have a loaded 2 door model and have had it for 2 years | It's the best car I've ever had | People constantly stop me to ask me about it | It's comfortable and very fast | The mpg is consistent | There is surprisingly a ton of room in this car | VW has great cars and this one is top of the heap | 
 "words": I've got 2000 miles on my GTI and she makes me smile | I'm 6'1 and I fit into the car nicely with plenty of space to go around and still feel I'm part of the car | A lot of attention is paid in the finish details like a luxury car | In my shopping stage it took me awhile to get over the stigma of the VW reliability that I heard from EVERYONE but after doing a lot of research the GTI is probably the BEST BET in the VW market | I got the candy white 4 door and it's a beauty | The DSG transmission makes driving an auto more fun than it should be however it takes time to get use to it but it's a whole new experience | For city livin' and city drivin' this is the best practical and FUN car for my needs | 
 "words": I have fun every time I drive my new GTI Red Tornado | I love everything about this little but very powerful car | I am very happy with my new Fast | I named my car Puppy and the little toy that comes with the car Fasty | I leave you guys alone now my little Puppy is waiting | RRRRRRR | 
 "words": This car reminds me what I love about German engineering | It drives like a dream in every way | I bought the car 2 or 3 months ago and I love it so much I still turn around after I park it to watch it as I walk away | 
 "words": There is an unbelievable difference between the 1 | 8L turbo 170hp in my Passat and the 2 | 0L Turbo 200hp in this GTI | It also feels a lot stronger than the 2 | 0L Turbo 210hp that I had in my 2002 WRX and overall is a much nicer car than the WRX quicker off the line better quality materials throughout and you always feel in complete control of the GTI | This GTI wants to move out fast whether you have the DSG Auto transmission in normal drive mode sport mode or manual shift mode | It shifts silky smooth in all three modes | The paddle shifters on the steering wheel are more toys than anything else but really fun ones | 
 "words": This car is fun to drive | It's quick and nimble and goes fast in a hurry | The seats are great | If you drive in the city the automatic is perfect | They finally made a GTI like it's supposed to drive | Get it with four doors drop the kids off at school and spend the day zipping around town | It's also under the radar screen people look but don't oogle | It's really a prefect car | Let's see how it does on the long term | The people at VW still need to work on service | 
 "words": I researched this car for months and looked at many different competitors all of which averaged twice the price | After researching every scrap of opinion available I came to want this car | My research somewhat prepared me for it but the first drive took me out of this world | The performance to price ratio in this car makes it a lion and the pure enjoyment of feeling the 200hp acceleration really puts it in a class far above the price point | If you have low ego emissions and want something REALLY fun to drive go GTI | You can't go wrong with this car | It's simply amazing and the voluminous articles out there in the rags have NOT steered me wrong | I love this car | 
 "words": What a blast | No one beats me at the lights | This car is always tempts me to drive fast | This is my first automatic transmission in decades the DSG with paddle shifters is the most fun | While the other guy is shifting your done and can see his frustrations in the rear view | There is nothing to not like about this car | I am sure that the poor gas mileage is my fault | 
 "words": The DSG transmission is awesome | Somehow maybe double clutch it smooths out driving at low speeds while retaining the juice | It feels taut inside apparently it is assembled in Germany in contrast to almost all other VW models | Unfortunately the stereo display is third world and the Sirius trial is worthless because you only have a sample of channels | The sunroof could be bigger | The interior trim is spare bordering on cheap | I see part of the reason why the A3 goes for more | I have the cloth which is alright but the seats don't feel like they'd treat me well on a long drive | I am glad that I chose the 4-door | It is not bigger than the 2-door but seems to get more out of the rear row while maintaining near identical trunk space | 
 "words": The VW GTI is more fun to drive than the BMW 325i and it holds four comfortably with room for the dog in the hatch | It even costs about 15000 less than a similarly-equipped BMW | It is larger and cheaper than the Audi A3 | It is almost as much fun to drive as the Mini Cooper S but sized for non-hobbits | It has the best transmission available period | I have had it for only one month and 800 miles but it has no rattles squeaks or problems of any kind | Its gas mileage has been 27 mpg combined using manual shift sport mode and a heavy foot | It gets 30 on the highway | 
 "words": This is the best GTI ever | It is so much fun to drive | It has amazing handling | If you are over 40 years old stay away from 18 tires they make the ride too rough | If you don't want to spend on winter tires and change them before every winter stay away from 18 tires | Other than that this is probably the most bang for your buck in a long time | 
 "words": After trading in a 350Z with reliability problems I wanted something practical that would still be fun to drive | With the GTI I do not feel like I made much of a sacrifice | This car is a blast to drive | It is quick and nimble | I'm not sure that I'm a joiner type so the VW community still scares me a little | but I love the car | 
 "words": I've never owned an auto tranny car until my DSG-equipped GTI | I was injured and couldn't work a clutch for a couple months | But I also club race and like control and performance | I also need to haul music gear and my 10 year old son to the beach etc | This car does all of it and then some | It offers great luxury with the leather heated seats and climate control | The 2 | 0T engine has plenty of punch and the DSG transmission is a chameleon drive it easy in D harder in S or full in manual mode with the paddle shifters | I drove an A3 also same platform but the GTI was more fun to drive and has more headroom shoulder room and more room in the back | I highly recommended this car | My other car is a '79 Porsche 911 that I'll never sell | 
 "words": This car is awesome | It has 200 hp and 207 lb | feet of torque | It gets up and goes | For those of you who are worried about reliability consider this previous models where built in Mexico this GTI is built in Wolfsburg Germany | Its handling is top notch for a car that weighs 3000 lbs | It is faster than its main competitor the Honda Civic Si | 
 "words": After test driving several cars Mazda3 MINI Subaru WRX Rabbit etc I decided to purchase the GTI | I knew right away that it was the car I wanted | It is so much fun to drive | It is very powerful handles corners great the interior is very comfortable it has a quiet ride gets good gas mileage is safe etc | It comes with built in Sirius Satellite radio | I was concerned about the electrical issues VWs are known for when researching cars but was reassured by the fact that the GTI is made only in Germany and that the electrical issues have been addressed | 
 "words": From the moment I test drove one of these I had to have one | I drove a 2003 A4 before this and this car blows my Audi away | This car is near perfect from the factory however if I could recommend two things to current owners to make it PERFECT Eibach Pro-kit springs and APR Stage I chip | Period | The springs lower the car about 1 and the chip adds about 45 HP and roughly 80-90 ft lbs | of torque as if it doesn't have enough already which is just enough to bring the performance up to a level that allows this car to compete with 350Z's G35's Boxsters 330Cis and even IS300's | 
 "words": The new GTI comes now in a four door model | The 2006 and 2007 modles have the new 2 | 0L turbocharged engine with 200 HP insted of the old 2006-2002 modles which had the 1 | 8L turbocharged engines with about 170HP | The turbocharger adds a lot of gas milage and gives it a lot of all around power | The exterior looks awesome it looks very fast don't you think even the new 4 door version | The new Honda Civic Si is cool but it does not have the turbocharger and the GTI gives you a lot more space for luggage | The rims avalible on the GTI are also way better than the Honda | That's what I think anyhow | I am not saying that the Honda is a is bad or anything in fact Hondas are great cars but the Volkswagen GTI is the way to go | 
 "words": The combination of the versatility of the DSG transmission spring for the extra grand with an amazingly torquey engine makes this one special car for the price | The four door version in my opinion improves its profile over the two door model not to mention it adds utility | The GTI's fit and finish are of the highest quality | It's a better looking than the Audi A3 for about eight grand less | The only downside so far is that collision insurance as with most VW's costs quite a bit more than average | 
 "words": The handling is better than ever | The performance is everything you read | The rear seat is roomier than my wife's mini-SUV really | And the computer says the engine has averaged 32 | 0 mpg in 7500 miles of mixed but usually gentle ok | not quite always gentle driving | 
 "words": I just got it and am loving it | I broke the 600 mile mark safety purposes and starting to break it in | She wants to go that's all there is to it | I thought about getting the automatic but missed the clutch and it's cheaper 1075 | It holds corners well I would just like a little more response through the steering wheel | It has amazing leg room in the back | The shoulder room does not accommodate three sets of broad shoulders being an ex-swimmer it's hard to find that in a small car | With the seats down you have more room than you expect | I almost bought Mazda3 | The GTI is a little more money but makes up for it in style and power | 
 "words": This car ROCKS | This is my all time favorite car | I have owned roughly two dozen cars in the past 17 years and this by far beats them all | It is a blast to drive and comes complete with a following | The VW culture is great and all the people I have met are fabulous | Not only did I end up with the best car I have ended up with a new family also and i love it |

 "words": I bought this car with 19000 miles trading in a BMWX3 | If you drive it conservatively it's comfortable economical the hatch makes it versatile and it provides a lot of amenities that you get with more expensive cars | When you want it the power and handling are terrific | The ride is a bit rough on rough roads but that was expected with low profile tires | I have had owned several sports sedans but always thought the power came at the expense of handling | This car makes a lot of sense and I could not be happier | Finally one unexpected benefit is the cloth seats which are cooler than leather in the summer sun | The car cools quickly after a stint in a parking lot | 
 "words": I am 6'5 and this car proved itself to be great roomy sporty economical and attractive | I traded my VW Gti 337 Ed due to thinking that it will break down as soon as I run out of warranty | Unfortunately I should have kept it | After 7 months of ownership the '07 GTi came across an issue a clunking noise in the front of the suspension | I went to research this on a vw forum and it turns out plenty of people have this problem | I attempted to fix this under warranty even dealt with VWOA and no fix has been found better yet it couldn't been replicated despite the fact that I had proof on video of many random recurrence and having a service manager replicated it to the quality rep from vw |
