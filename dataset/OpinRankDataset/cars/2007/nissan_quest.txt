REVIEWS
 "words": I got this van for more room when I had my second child | Not that I have 3 things are starting to look gray | I love the seats and actually think they are comfortable except the third row is not made for adults or more than 2 car seats | My recline handles on my second row seats have broken on both sides twice | The interior is very cheaply made and not worth the money on any model | There are only 2cup holders in the front which is a hassle | It drives great and is awesome on long trips | In town the gas mileage stinks | I wish we would have done more looking before we purchased this van | I do love the power and reliability | So I love a little and hate a little | 
 "words": This van has been a sorry purchase from the start | 7 months after we got it I called the nav number and they told me I needed to buy a new 280 disc as any addresses newer than 5 years in Houston could not be located next the tires have gone bald after only 32K miles Nissan canceled this feature and now we are to pay for all new tires and sensored rims as Michelin or Nissan will come thru | It is cheaply made and has all the packages on it even tho we can't get some to work | Head rests are uncomfortable also leg room on front passenger side | For the price it's an utter failure and can't believe Nissan won't stand by owners problems
 "words": This van is drives like a car | We used to have a Honda Odyssey and the Quest definitely drives like a car | We have used in around town and for long cross country trips and the van performed well under both scenarios | Interior space is good for the driver and in the second row | Whenever I have been seated in the front passenger seat it doesn't feel comfortable | The 3rd seat row is very cramped and the bench seat back is too short | Definitely not a place for adults | 
 "words": I bought this car 1 1 2 yrs ago have no problems with it at all | About the front seats the upper lumbar is angled too far back so you never really can press your back against it | I love the interior very spacious inside although the ext design makes it appear more sleek | I recently took it for a 1000K mile trip w 3 adults and 3 children | It was very easy ride comfortable and felt safe | Lots of power and gas mileage was very good on hwy | It sure stinks in the city though 15 24 | 
 "words": We bought this car because my wife wanted her dogs to have easier access to get in | It is a beautiful van | Mileage is not what they tell in the city | Its way better on long vacation trips | So don't by this one unless you can afford the expense to have it | It takes some work to keep it clean inside | So in other words this better be your second car | Specially with the games they play with the cost of gas | When gas was at its most expensive close to 5 a gallon it cost almost 70 to fill up | Now that gas prices have fallen to 1 | 50 in our area its under 30 a tank | Is the inside as good as I saw 4 years ago | No | I miss the center console idea I saw in another friend's Quest | 
 "words": Wow a great looking minivan | I was completely impressed with the modern design sporty look awesome 27 mpg hwy etc | I've had the van for 1 | 5 years and am worried about reliability | All automated doors sensors gauges are giving me funny issues like doors sticking sensors going out | Then I had to replace the tires at 30k runflats | Only one tire is available at 350 apiece | So I need a truck now and am giving the van to my wife since I cannot sell it until it's paid off | After 1 | 5 years only worth 19k trade in | This van has everything skyview dvd nav etc | and it dropped 20k in 2 years | I'll never buy Nissan again | 
 "words": We drive that car on horrible northern Canada roads and up to now 2 years of ownership absolutely no problem with it | We knew the Odyssey reliability is better than the Quests but the price and style of the Quest finally got us and we do not regret at all | The front seats are not very comfortable but the rest is good | Good value for the money | 
 "words": While our van is still fine I don't see it holding up well over the test of time | I researched many makes and models before settling on the Quest | This was my first van purchase going from a convertible sports car to a minivan I found the Quest to be the most stylish looking on the market | Our tire sensors are always lit on the dashboard very annoying | When we got 500 miles on the van we had to have a fuel pressure tank or something like that replaced | It sat on the dealership lot for 30 days before it was fixed | Overall I wish I'd spent a little more money on a higher end van | Nothing has broken so far but I fear it's just a matter of time | Very cheaply made inside | 
 "words": We traded our 04 quest for an 07 quest | Huge mistake | The 04 is nothing like the 07 at all | Storage is very limited | Seats are uncomfortable | Air barely blows any air | Heat takes forever to heat up and blow | Cloth seats get very dirty due to pattern chose on material | Lots of things that are plastic have broken air vents cup holders etc | It gets horrible gas mileage | I drive to school and back and I use a tank in three to four days | That is going nowhere else approx | 14-17 mpg | not good at all | Not very roomy | Our sliding door kept popping dealership said couldn't fix when window shattered in a million pieces | DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE | 
 "words": When I purchased this car I loved the features | Now almost two years later I regret buying it | While still very pretty for a mini van every thing is breaking | The rear cup holders the rear sonar the rear cover | Every little piece of plastic that can break is breaking | I could understand if I was hard on the vehicle | But it is mostly city driving which the mileage is horrible 11-13 miles per gallon | 
 "words": I live in the city NYC the bumpers get banged all the time and as a result it looks all beaten the seat are extremely uncomfortable my kids scream every time I hit a pot hole the gas mileage in the city is too poor it is way to expensive for city driving | Otherwise ok | 
 "words": Nice exterior | Love the comfort of the second row seats and the way they fold down onto the floor | Love the ceiling skylights for the back passengers | Two DVD screens are a great feature | Gas mileage is OK considering a large vehicle | 
 "words": We traded in a European luxury sedan for the Quest an appropriate car for a growing family | Both me and my wife drive the van and it takes time to get used to it but once you get over the gas pedal softness it becomes comfortable | Has ample power and gets OK gas mileage | Some of the materials they used to make the car are cheap and breakable | The only problem so far is the tire pressure sensor | Knowing that there are problems with the sensor by reading similar reviews it seems like Nissan should have a recall for it | It accommodates 7 comfortably | From the outside it is better designed than that the other box vans that you see on the road | The kids love it because of the ample space | 
 "words": Great family car | Have had ours for about ten months and 5000 miles | No problems | Highly recommend the car and have no regrets what so ever | Take a look to see how many recalls there have been on the 07 quest and you will understand why I think so highly of it The only draw back is the lack of snow tires for this vehicle 225-65-16 | 
 "words": I bought this van with 3 miles on it | I wanted a family car and I really liked the way the quest looked | Thus I bought one | This was the worst purchase I have ever made | It has been to the dealership 7 times since March | I have had 4 tire sensor problems that the dealership can't fix | I also had a mildew smell coming out of my vents | The dealership told me that something could have crawled into the van and DIED and that this would not be covered under my warranty | I would have to pay for them to fix this problem | A brand new van | Finally the dealership has the smell in the vents fixed but the tire sensor is still flagging and the van doesn't qualify as a lemon per Nissan | DO NOT BUY | 
 "words": We bought a new '07 Quest last weekend | We liked the looks of the un-minivan but choice for an entry level model was very limited | They really move these models so you don't get much selection | The interior room was light years ahead of our 1999 Quest | Power was nice also | Did not get leather but cloth interior looks cheap and probably prone to catch dirt in the waffle pattern | 
 "words": Trade in 1999 Mercury Villager Quest clone with 120K miles | Except for tach everything still worked | We thought that the Nissan Quest would be as reliable and useful but now we are wondering if the extra cost of a Honda or Toyota would have been a better choice | Maybe we should have bought used | On the way home the button that slides the seatbelt adjuster up and down broke and fell into the door post | This was after 30 minutes of ownership | Three days later my wife tells me that the A C does not seem to blow as cold as it did when we got it | 
 "words": My wife used to hate the thought of driving a minivan until she drove Quest | It's the best family car with ample legroom in front rear and third row seats | We love taking this car for long drives and will soon drive cross country | I recommend Quest to everybody | Enjoy your ride | 
 "words": The Quest is a great van I even managed to get 32 miles per gallon cruise at 67 miles per hour | On the other hand there are two main problems with the car first front driver side seat moves | Second the tire bounces but that is not a Quest problem that is a Goodyear problem you cannot balance the tires the only way to eliminate this problem is to have the dealership replace the tires | Nissan dealer tested 16 tires before they found 4 good ones | test was called road force it fails every time | It | s not dangerous it | s only irritating | I also had problems with vibration while braking while driving through hills of West Virginia | 
 "words": First the bad news after 500 mile road trip | Front seats don't provide the comfort quality support that second row seats do | Longer seat bottoms like the second row would be the fix for tall guys | The seat covering on front of the driver and passenger seats bottoms will not stay attached to the seat pan | I noticed this in the first 30 miles | It's on my list to fix | The hood headlights and grille don't line up correctly | Gaps are off on lift gate | Low speeds 18-22 MPH on gravel roads leaves the trans hunting for right gear | Not enough storage areas | Steering wheel is too far from driver when seat is back | Tires vibrate even after dealer balanced them before I took delivery | 
 "words": I initially purchased a 2004 Nissan Quest SE and I absolutely loved it DVD player didn't hurt | My 17-year old son was involved in a bad accident in my 2004 Quest | He walked away without a scratch | the car suffered all the front end damage but my son had not one scratch | Unfortunately my 2004 Quest had to be totalled because it absorbed all of the energy and the frame was crumpled behind the engine | Well I had 2 days to shop for a vehicle and I kept coming back to the Quest | I bought the 2007 Nissan Quest 3 | 5S in chestnut brown it is a beautiful car and my 8 yr-old twins love the car | I highly recommend the Quest | 
 "words": I swore I would never buy a minivan again but I'm glad that I took a chance on the un-minivan as Nissan has touted it | It feels like a car to drive handling and driving so well you forget you are in a minivan | The stereo is great and the spacious interior is wonderful | I had 3 large SUVs before going back to a minivan and I don't miss a thing | The cargo bay is great for groceries and the captains chairs are a nice feature as are the dual DVD players for both the second and third rows | 
 "words": Purchased van early 07 and have not regretted my decision | It's spacious and perfect for a family vehicle | I looked at Toyota Honda and Nissan | Nissan was definitely the best buy for the money | It makes for a great ride on long trips with young kids with the dvd entertainment | I like the exterior design | not so 'minivan' looking | 
 "words": I leased a 2004 nissan quest se it was good to us | I feel comfortable knowing my family is safe my wife tested that thankfully the van passed and my family walked away the van made a full recovery | I take that heavily | So in respect to the van I looked for another and bought my 2007 se | It's like falling in love all over | We checked out the competition but found things we didn't like in all of them | Now the Quest that's a cool Dad a happy wife and an entertained 4 year old did I mention dual 8 screens and skyviews | 
 "words": I looked at all the 2007 vans and drove most | Absolutely the best for the money and better than most regardless of price | 
 "words": In addition to an excellent safety rating it had the most features at a reasonable price | Spacious interior excellent V6 power engine smooth and quiet drive easy fold 3rd-row seat | We like the sleek exterior style as well as the re-modeled interior 2007 | 
 "words": Very nice outlook | Looks classy drives good but not at all reliable | Electronics inside the car trouble you frequently | We have been to dealership once every three months with problems | They can't call it a lemon but can't figure out the problems either | Nissan extended our warranty which did not help | High end vehicle such as Quest should be more reliable | If you are planning to get 100K out of this be prepared to have 2nd or 3rd car handy | Tires wear out quickly unusual category of Goodyear tire | Gearshaft gets locked I could not move it from Park to Drive | It got stuck at passenger pick up area in the airport fun | None of my impressions are exaggerated | 
 "words": Someone rear-ended me and I got a horrible whiplash and the rear was bent badly at 30 mph | Turns out that the rear bumper is made of PLASTIC not a steel bumper like the Toyota Sienna | Also the headrests are ergonomically wrong because they are too far back so it does NOT protect you from a whiplash | The Nissan Quest also rides too low to the ground so it tends to scrape things and the long wheelbase got me scraping the pavement which took out a baseball size hole in my the van's body | The wheelbase is too long so turning radius is huge so you can't make a U-turn and parking is difficult because it always require backing up and forth | 
 "words": ok not as firm a shift as i remember nissan having this is my 5th nissan product | air noise is noticeable as is wheel bounce at higher speeds | Rear pop side window rattles when open | does not always catch when start | 
 "words": This van offers style performance for those of us who still love driving but need to accommodate lots of passengers gear | The sky view package adds a unique airiness to the interior the kids love it | With the skyview package there are 2 TV monitors for the integrated DVD w 2 cordless headphones so adults can listen to radio when the kids are watching a movie The rear view camera sonar system is indispensable for the reverse- driving-challenged | The foldaway seating is easy to use the interior design has thoughtful practical details | Definitely order the PAX Navigation package if you like the latest technology I didn't wish I had | The low city gas mileage is the only downfall
 "words": I'm a guy who has to drive a minivan | To be honest I didn't even look at or consider any other minivan | Nissan is the only one that had any kind of style | I did wait until the 07 models due to the previous quality and design issues | We've had it 5 months and we have not had any problems | It looks great rides smooth the interior has a clean modern feel and it handles exceptionally well for such a big van | Everything is in reach and works as advertised | The red chili seats look great with the gray exterior and trim and they look unlike any other minivan | My only problem is getting the kids out of the van they like it so much | 
 "words": I bought the SL trim from a local dealer | I did extensive research on this trim before making the decision | There is no other mini van model that provided the features that the nissan quest comes with | The only feature that I missed on the quest is that it doesn't come with the turn indicators on the side view mirrors and the rear windows are fixed | Gives u the best features that u could get for the named price | The best comfort that ur 's could get you | Overall layout of the gadgets is one of a kind | 
 "words": My husband bought me a 2007 Quest in Blue on New Year's Eve | It is a fabulous minivan | I love the power the design and the fact that it doesn't look like all the other boring minivans out on the road | I have nothing but good things to say about my Quest and am so happy that my husband traded in my Odyssey | Keep up the good work Nissan | 
 "words": Just purchased a 2007 3 | 5SL love the new interior improvements and dashboard | Power is excellent the whole family loves to drive in it | No complaints Nissan got the RD right this time look out Honda | 
 "words": I looked at both the Nissan Quest and the Honda Odyssey | Pricing was about the same as I purchased the top end vehicle | I drive a lot and wanted comfort | The interiors of both the Quest and the Odyssey are well done good looking and functional | Exterior wise the Quest makes the Odyssey look like a cardboard box | Honda does stick it to you though every bit of trim is high priced and extra | Drivability is the Quest's side | The Honda has loose steering and hesitates on acceleration | I could say a lot more but between the two buy the Quest | It is the hands down choice | And you do not have to deal with the Honda Arrogance and high interest rates for financing | 
 "words": I have a 4x4 2006 frontier 4dr and Mitsubishi evo car how cool is that | told myself never ever buy a van | Van for Oldies | Guess what | I got married got kid on the way | I argued my wife coz she wants a van | go to nissan and got a good deal for my truck loyalty discount and a huge savings | I test drive it it was amazing run like a car smooth driving more engine power and the most important thing is it tows 3500 max better than my truck | very spacious superb design | only thing i don't like is the 2 front seats hard to lean on your back | I never thought that I'll drive a van | 
 "words": I bought this van because of its uniqueness | The only complaint I have against the van is that it is so low to the pavement | With that being said I enjoy driving this vehicle as much as my kids love traveling in it | We trade-in vehicles about every 5 years and I will definitely purchase another Quest | 
 "words": Simply love it my wife likes it even more due to the kids | Yes were happy
 "words": Pros Lots of Standard features Yes in base 3 | 5 model | Traction ABSBrake Assist curtain airbags Tire pressure monitoring 2nd and 3rd Row AC Vent Foldable 2nd and 3rd row seats Trip Computer Decent Audio system with AUX port for MP3 Excellent Saftey Excellent Performance Decent gas milage 14-18 city 25 Highway Very good suspension Cons Nothing so far we have driven only 1500 miles | The look from the back would have been slightly better | We got a black color one and that looks great Overall We wanted a base model minivan and doing extensive research | We compared Toyota Honda Chrysler Nissan and few other base models and Quest is the Best | 
 "words": The vehicle was well improved on the interior from 2006 to 2007 | It has a great amount of power for a minivan | It is not your mother's minivan | It has space that others do not have | 
 "words": i'm one of those i will never drive a minivan people | then i became a parent and quickly realized that the only way to successfully transport said baby and his entorage was do gulp get a bigger car | we looked at toyota and honda before settling on the quest | for the price it had a lot of the features that cost 10K more in the ohter two brands | not to mention it was by far the best looking | not that hideous girly shape | we also LOVE all the interior room and the 3 | 5 engine same one as the z car has a lot of get-up-and-go that i totally didn't expect | i enjoy driving it in spite of myself and my son's car seat goes in and out effortlessly | 
 "words": We are new to the minivan thing so i can only say moving from the 2005 Nissan Altima I am very pleased with the Quest so far | Drivability has been great it handles very well for a minivan and has plenty of room to boot | Looking at the 06 model versus the 07 I have to say they are moving the design in the right direction on the styling | 
 "words": We bought this van after looking at the Honda Entourage and Town Country | The Entourage and TC left a bit to be desired and the Honda packaging options meant we were spending a lot of money for some options we wanted and a lot for some we didn't | The main option we would've liked but wasn't available was AWD | The interior was by far the nicest of all the vans and although there wasn't as much storage as the Honda lazy susan in floor the fact that no seats had to be removed to have cargo space really helped | 
 "words": Overall I can't imagine being more happy in any other van but I wouldn't give 10s to anyone hence the 9s | It drives and handles a little better than our 2004SE | Controls are more intuitive | Although still getting used to the new information display it's been very nice so far | Overall arrangement is a little crammed and the center storage area disappoints | Although that could just be my unique way of using storage areas unquestionably if you liked the ability in 2004 models to swing your legs around to get in the back area from the front that's no longer easy to do | Phone and DVD systems work very well and the audio ROCKS | 
 "words": Just traded in our 04 Quest SL for an 07 Quest SL | Our 04 had 34000 miles on it and never once had to be returned to the dealership other than for routine maint | We've only had the 07 for a week so there isn't a lot about reliabilty to report yet We are most impressed with the power smoothness of the 3 | 5L engine and 5 speed auto transmission | This 07 seems even more refined than the 04 in fit finish | We were glad to see the addition of left side sliding door and traditional location for speedometer over steering wheel | 
 "words": Just bout the van last week | We took 2 other couples to a Packer game | All were impressed | We are takin our 2 children on a 240 mile trip this weekend and looking forward to it | 
 "words": I purchased my new '07 Quest on a Thursday and left on Friday for a 4600 mile trip with 2 kids 6 and 7 | The built in DVD player is great so are the wireless headphones | The ride is smooth and overall my Quest is very comfortable | I love the extra options in the minivan that I did not have with my Tahoe and I really like the increased gas mileage | 
 "words": Great job on the redesign | Love the dual DVd screens | Lots of room and the comfort is fantastic | 
 "words": I have tested Odyssey Sienna and Quest | We wanted to buy anything other than Quest as we were bored with Nissan in the past | Sienna was good and were about to buy it but when we test drove 07 Quest SE fully loaded we were pleasantly surprised | Steering is much smoother accelaration for once outpaces Sienna | Interior leg space is much better than Sienna and with multiple skylights my daughter fell in love with it | Ride is superb and very comfortable interior it is a sheer joy for our family | It was more expensive than Sienna 06 XLE but is superior and rollover testing was also excellent highway safety | Until a redesigned Sienna or Honda Odyssey are available 07 Quest seemed best | 
 "words": Engine stalls and will leave you stranded vents don't close so you always smell the outside or get hot cold feet sliding door does not close properly because it keeps reversing many rattles and squeaks vents in the ceiling keep falling dealers don't know how to fix things so you keep going back to fix the same thing | Dealer does not do an oil change when that's what I asked them to do because oil is still dirty and they said that's the color of their oil but when I took it back a week later for an oil change it's a clean and clear color | Tires are a weird size and are very expensive because only Goodyear sells them | 
 "words": We compared the new Quest with both the Toyota and Honda vans and this newest version outpaced both | The comfortable seating that folds flat both in the second and third rows the larger interior volume stylish exterior skyview roof all were Quest advantages but it's greatest attributes are it's driving and handling qualities | It simply out runs and outhandles the competition hands down | We have not had the Quest a long while yet but so far we are really impressed and love this Nissan | 
 "words": I would Give the quest an overall 7 | 8 it is not perfect but then again no other car is
 "words": this is really the best van in the market | I was very impressed | the new styling now competes with its competition | 
 "words": I Purchased 2007 Nissan Quest SE Smoke color with gray leather interior recently from Fairfax Nissan | This minivan is loaded with cool features very comfortable ride | Yet to test the fuel economy on this | Dual screen DVD is a plus and 10 speaker Bose system with 6 CD changer and MP3 playback is sweet | Automatic seat adjustments and heated seat options are well thought of | The tech package includes Bluetooth connectivity to the cell phone | Unfortunately my cell phone is Audiovox and it is not listed as its compatible phones | So yet to test this feature | Overall very satified with the car | The second row fold away is good option but doesn't completely folds flat |
