 "words": I bought Pilot EXL AWD over a year back and thought I would use it for a while before I did the review | A year and 10K miles later I am completely satisfied with my Pilot | This vehicle gives you the practicality of a minivan or close without having to buy a minivan | The vehicle has good ergonomics and the lot of nice storage compartments etc | It handles well and gives about 21 | 5 mpg on the highway and about 16 17 in the city | The third row seats are excellent for moderate sized adults | Great Value for Money | 
 "words": The fuel consumption estimate on the sales sticker states 17 MPG city and 22 MPG highway | I get from 9 to 12 MPG | Dealer keeps telling me to wait for the engine to break in but as I put more miles on this gas guzzler the fuel efficiency is getting worse | 
 "words": I tested in snow by taking it for a spin and it maintained its grip on the pavement | Engine sounds powerful and responsive | My biggest issue is with the mileage claim | Honda say 17 22 and I have consistently getting no more than 18 miles on mostly highway drive | 
 "words": I got this because me and the wife needed not only the extra space but also something that would not strand us when it snows | It has all the safety features we need for our two boys 2 yrs and one on the way | It yelled at my wife for not buckling up | That was awesome | The Pilot handles like a dream | Whenever I need that extra kick it gives it to me | On the snow it responds smoothly with no shakiness | I don't know what others had but my wheels have not shaking going past 65 | I have gone as fast as 85 with no waggle | But the road noise was something else | 
 "words": Previously owned a 2003 Pilot | We now have the 2007 EXL 2 wheel drive | Excellent vehicle all the way around | Great acceleration comfort space and looks | Compared to our previous SUV which was a 4 Runner from Toyota the Honda Pilot appears to be a more solid vehicle | It gives you a great sense of security | 
 "words": have had this for only two months and the gas mileage has been no better than 15 mpg | we lease and i called to see if we bought another honda vehicle would they consider to get us out of lease | response was it would cost us at least 3000 dollars to get out of lease | very disappointed with all parties concerned | we had a buick rendezvous and were much happier | should have stayed with buick | 
 "words": I enjoy the looks of this car and the beauty of the ride | Mileage isn't that great but this is an SUV and the engine has some spunk | The only big complaint is the size of the key | It's BIG | Couldn't they have built it to fold in a case | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle because my family and I did not want a mini van | The Pilot is excellent in all ways because of not only safety but comfort and reliability | The Navi is great and we got the pilot for 5000 off msrp | The only quirk with the pilot is it seems to hesitate during acceleration and the dealer couldn't duplicate it | But other than that this car just ROCKS in almost every way | 
 "words": I've had my new Pilot for a month now | Smooth ride comfortable seating large cargo area with third row folded flat | Gas mileage has been as advertised 18 city just don't gun it off the line and you'll be fine | Crossbars on roof rack should be standard | Don't notice the front-end wobbling at high speeds others have complained about | 
 "words": We bought this vehicle mostly because we disliked it the least | Coming out of driving only cars I am appalled at how poorly this thing handles | Steering response is so slow mushy that I feel like I am sending signals to the engine room hard aport | whenever I make a steering adjustment | Also I was very surprised that the 6disk CD changer does not play mp3 encoded disks | On the plus side the build quality is excellent the engine is quite and responsive and the seating arrangement is very versatile 
 "words": This is my second PILOT | The first was a new 2004 LX great vehicle | The 2007 EX-L however is an outstanding vehicle | Honda has refined the design | Listened to the customer and made small changes that make a big difference in the PILOT driving experience | 
 "words": So far this vehicle has exceeded my expectations | My combined mileage has been 19 MPG and as advertised 22 MPG straight out highway driving | Cabin noise level is very quiet | What little road noise there is comes from the cheap Goodyear tires | I have read a few online reviews about drive line vibes but even up to 90 MPH my Pilot is very smooth and drives very tight | We have had 2 snowfalls recently | the 4WD works great and the vehicle gets excellent traction | The Pilot drives rides and performs much better than the Grand Cherokee Explorer and Four Runner | These vehicles don't compare in quality either | 
 "words": Zero problems after 4 | 5 months | Very useful storage space | Acceptable boat towing capability except for frequent shifts at highway speeds | Transmission is very smooth and acceleration is quite good considering the tiny engine | Disappointing highway gas mileage to date has only been approximately 20 mpg | Climate control and audio systems are excellent | People comfort in the first two rows is very good | Third row is folded down for additional storage and will never be used | Handling is okay | Brakes are easy to modulate but panic stops require more pressure than any of my other recent vehicles | A very satisfactory but not a spectacular vehicle | 
 "words": I got 2k off of invoice to buy the Pilot in January | The EX-L MSRP is 33840 the invoice was 30530 and I paid 28530 | How can you go wrong | Great truck | The new Acura visions of the new Pilot doesn't really make me want to wait and buy at or near sticker | I think it is well equipped very comfortable and as safe as any vehicle on the road | I was considering a Benz or BMW but everyone I talk to that has one says you have to sell before the warranty is up | As good as any vehicle for the money- it is a depreciating asset | I wish there were better colors | I have no idea what some others have said about a vibration at 55mph | They must need a tire balance | GREAT TRUCK BUY IT | 
 "words": I love my Pilot | I strayed from Honda with my last vehicle being a Toyota | I thought the quality were similar | I was wrong | Owned Honda's since the early 90's and never regretted it once | I feel extremely safe in my Pilot | Quiet ride although it is still a truck | Very little leaning taking corners at higher speeds | Really holds to the road | Extremely roomy and comfortable | If you are trying to decide to buy this vehicle do it | You wont regret it | 
 "words": Had an 06 Accord EX-L and then bought the 07 Pilot EX-L | The engine transmission and 4WD system are all flawless | Effortless engagement are the two words that come to mind when describing these systems | The engine is silky smooth and near silent | The tranny is always in the right gear and never misses a beat | You can barely feel the tug when the rear wheels kick in | Considering the size and weight of the vehicle rides almost as nice as the Accord | Love the size and interior space great for hauling loads of just about anything around | Could have bought any SUV manufactured by the big 3 and save thousands but still chose the Pilot | Simply put It's a Honda | 
 "words": Performance in several different facets is near top of the line | The handling around turns for a vehicle of that size is jaw dropping to me having been previously accustomed to driving an Explorer for 6 years | I was initially somewhat skeptical that an engine displacement of only 3 | 5 L was enough to get the kick in the pants sometimes required to merge into tight traffic | Again very impressed with the Honda VTEC engine | Its operation is very smooth quiet and very responsive when getting into the higher RPMs thanks to the variable valve timing | It's more acceleration than I'll ever need for daily commuting | Plenty of room for passengers in three rows of seating | 
 "words": Beware before you buy a Honda Pilot | The car has lots of peep but that is about it | After 65 mph the front wheel shakes like crazy there are hundreds of complaints on the web about this | Honda cannot find the problem | We took the car there 7-8 times | Next after a few months smoke began pouring out of the A | C | and could not be driven | Then a few weeks ago an electric problem stranded my wife and daughter who was coming home from the Doctor | The next week the same thing happened again | Finally the gas mileage is HORRIBLE | Just as bad as my Ford Expedition | The EPA of 17 22 is not even close | 
 "words": This is one heck of a value well built well designed and well priced | Sure it lacks some of the luxury touches you find on other makes HID memory seats Bluetooth wood trim but for us these items were not worth the extra 8k 10 even though we can afford it | Put it in the 529 for the yutes 
 "words": Since I first test drove this SUV in 2004 and now in 2006 what a difference | The interior is roomy and set up for everyone's comfort | I am tall and it's just perfect for all size people | I bought the 2007 model | 
 "words": I truly Love driving the Pilot | However it's been back to the Dealership at least 8-10 times for numerous problems | Seven times for the same problem | I worked for Honda as the Finance Director for 15 yearsand brought in hundreds of Customers | I'm in the process of going directly to the top of Honda for help | The problems I have hadare unbelievable | I've owned 5 Honda's and Love them my commuter has 162000 miles and I Love the Pilot | However I will NOT KEEP THIS CAR | Things happen and WOW I have had too many problems to write about | They say they can't duplicate the problem | I have 2 major problems and I've had 7- 8 others they fixed | Howeverthe 2 Major PROBLEMS THEY CAN'T | 
 "words": Went with the 2007 Pilot over the CRV to get extra space as we often total 4 adult passengers and sometimes more | CRV felt a little tight for 4 tops | Preferred the superior quality of the leather in the Pilot | CRV leather felt thin and has a tufted look which some may prefer but we don't | CRV felt somewhat underpowered but not too bad | No question the Pilot has plenty of power | Overall very pleased with the Pilot | Expecting it will do well in the snow if we get any | 
 "words": I have owned 3 Explorers 1 Blazer and 1 Yukon and this is definitely the best yet | I picked it up on a Friday and went out of town the next day | I got 25 mpg on the highway | I paid 3000 | less than I was quoted on the Toyota Highlander and this is a good bit larger vehicle | This has got to be the best SUV in this size class | Before purchasing I check the sales prices of 3 yr | old Pilots with over 50000 miles and they were selling for only 5000 | less than I paid for thes 2007 model | How's that for not much depreciation | 
 "words": My wife an I looked at several alternatives | Including the Lexus RX 330 Acura MDX and the Toyota 4 Runner | What we found that at several thousands less and with all of the features we wanted including Rear backup camera and DVD navigation we couldn't shy away from the value this vehicle has to offer | With the money we saved we opted for several accessories to add some class such as wood trim and chrome tubes steps and we still only hit the 31000 mark | We got a great deal and a awesome car | This vehicle's MSRp with Accessories is over 36000 wow | You won't be disappointed | One note though if there is any thing I would change it would be a tighter or firmer steering 
 "words": This Pilot AWD with NAV replaces my 2003 Infinti FX35 | The FX was a great vehicle with three exceptions | Very poor seating driver seat power buttons under your right leg Extremely rough ride in rear seat when driving on anything other than a very smooth road and very poor visibility due to rounded design | Honda on the other hand has excellent visibility plenty of glass area plus third row seatingand runs on regular gas plus most of the options I had on the Infiniti for 14000 | less at sticker | After looking at big sister Acura decided to stay with little sister Honda Pilot | Plenty of Bang for the Buck | 
 "words": For 4 years I had my Honda Pilot 2003 and I loved it | It was a very comfortable driver's seat and had a lot of leg room | I renewed my lease and got a new Honda 2007 Pilot | The driver's seat does not have the same leg room as my previous Honda | That is the driving seat does not slide back enough and makes driving uncomfortable | It | s very disappointing to me 
 "words": I was struck last week by a driver running a red light | My Pilot flipped and landed on the roof | I was fine and everyone says it's a miracle that I'm alive | The car did EXACTLY what it was supposed to do and saved my life | Besides Honda's well-known reliability the safety of this vehicle is unparalleled | Since it was a total loss I'll be buying another | 
 "words": We had a 2002 Trailblazer and had transmission problems | That is why I went back to Honda | I have a 1990 Accord with 200000 plus and no major mechanical problems | We love the design and interior and all the standard features of the pilot | The price was very good compared to other manufacturers | 
 "words": The family is soon to grow again so we decided to swap out the '03 CRV | While the mileage suffered not surprisingly we're so happy with our decision to go with the Pilot | It's a blast to drive and has so many handy little features that we didn't realize we were missing out on | Incredibly solid on the road feels very substantial without feeling just plain BIG | We're just hoping this thing performs as well in snow as the CRV did I've read less than stellar reviews on the Goodyear Integrity tires that come on the Pilot | So far we love it | 
 "words": We bought our Pilot in July and already have over 14000 miles on it | We have previously owned civics accords and an odyssey | We purchased the Pilot because of the positive track record we have personally experienced with Honda | We have not been disappointed | 
 "words": The Pilot handles great | More like a car than a truck | I looked at the Acura MDX and found the Pilot a better value | I had two Ford Explorers and switched to Honda and I am loving it |

 "words": Test drive it then I told myself | gotta have it | My first SUV | Fun to drive with lots of standard features
 "words": The Pilot drives handles better than the 03 MDX Premium it replaced | The road manners and feel in the wheel are better | The rake of the windshield is less providing better all around visibility | 
 "words": We are amazed how this vehicle does so many things well | It has all the functionality of an SUV but on the road it rides more like a luxury car | It's truly the best riding vehicle we have ever owned | 
 "words": I picked up my pilot a week ago love driving it | It drives like a car not a truck | 
 "words": Car is a little too big for my original needs but it is better to have more space than less | Fuel economy reasonable for its size | Seat a little hard to get comfortable in I am very big | Well made peppy lots of creature comforts | Nav system a fun toy | Back up camera useful | All in all an excellent value | 
 "words": Looked for an SUV for my wife for 6 months including BMW M-B others | My wife didn't give the OK until she drove the Pilot | Lots of bells whistles but well laid out easy to use | It's incredibly well- equipped with pleasant surprises everywhere | She raves about it and her friends want the salesman's card | 
 "words": I know I know to have two of the same vehicle sounds different however we cross the continental divide often in the winter | We liked front wheel drive had a minivan but having an extra two drive wheels has been often reassuring | One of us is not very hip on the outside design but is comforted by their quality mechanicals | Most people who ride in them comment that they will seriously consider buying one also | Plainly that is what sells these Pilots | Looking to motor in them for at least 10 years or 200000 miles whichever comes first | 
 "words": I have a 2007 Mercedes SL550 and needed a winter vehicle | I bought the Honda Pilot | Enough said | 
 "words": There is only one area i'm not having fun with which is the blower | When I have the blower Off I can still feel air blowing on me I hoped I can change to have the blower blow only on the window but that is not an option the defogger window blower also blows with face or foot | This is very uncomforatble I wish newer version would have this as an option i | e no blow when off or blower to window only and and not combined with face or foot
 "words": A great car to drive | My first car with navigation system don't know how i survived without it | My previous suv was an Accura MDX | The Honda pilot is as good if not better at 7000 less in cost | 
 "words": I picked up my 07 Pilot today | This is my second Pilot | It is comfortable stylish and responsive | I wish the mpg were better but it's a vast improvement over my old SUV a 98 Range Rover | 
 "words": Whatever nice features this car might have they pale when you consider the gas consumption | Don't believe the rated MPG | It is much worse | I get 10 MPG in the city and 17 on the highway | The car has over 20000 miles so it is definitely past the break-in period | 
 "words": So that I can turn this dog back in | No way I'd ever consider buying it | Interior seems to be an afterthought | Was nice at first but no ipod jack | Heck even a Ford Focus has this | Toyota next time
 "words": 5 of last 6 cars my wife I owned were Honda's | We are very satisfied with them and the Pilot is no exception | It rides well has great driver's seat room I am 6' 4 | You definitely won't feel cramped in the car | It also is very quiet | After 5000 miles I average 13 miles to gallon but I only drive in the city | I was looking more for the 17 it said on the sticker | If it were not for the gas I would say this car is fantastic | 
 "words": We leased this 2007 pilot 4wd LX | I break-in this SUV very well so now I can get 0-60 mph w in 6 seconds | MPG is average for an SUV | Driving is great especially in the snow but not in dynamic actions | A lot of noise in rough roads but like riding on a boat while in highways | Engine and transmission are great | 
 "words": I love this car | It is comfortable and has many nice luxury features | One can't go wrong with a Honda | More expensive than other suvs and the inside features are worth it | Gas mileage is very poor | Had I know this I might had purchased the Toyota 4 Runner | If you want luxury this is the car for you | If you want to tow or help the environment steer clear | 
 "words": The Pilot was great and I certainly would not have traded it in but the mice decided to make it home | They had no problem getting in and out of the interior which doesn't work with a young child | Other than that and the poor gas mileage 15 MPG I liked the car | I do not have the same rodent problem with my 07 Ridgeline
 "words": What can you say it's a Honda | Rugged Reliable good on gas for its size | I get a solid 20 mpg highway and about 16 in mixed driving | Low maintenance needed and I do most myself | After near 40000 miles not a single problem | Comfortable but needs to be set up for nav and sat radio
 "words": We have owned our Pilot for 8 months and have been very happy with it | We were looking for a smaller SUV that could still seat 8 people if needed | The back seats are cramped when you have 8 people or children in the car but are adequate for short trips | The acceleration is good and it has a tighter turning radius than our last vehicle Chevy Impala which makes it nice for parking | The fuel mileage isn't all I had hoped that it would be about 16-18 mpg city and about 22 highway | Doesn't have automatic headlights which took some time getting used to | 
 "words": I leased my 2007 Honda Pilot last year in summer | Just after getting home with it I heard the horror stories about mice | I thought OK so maybe some people have problems with mice | Hopefully I don't | No such luck I just got back from paying the dealership to remove a mouse from the blower housing | Wonderful | This is not a small problem apparently this is a big one | Honda has been very silent about this longstanding problem and is not stepping up to the plate to solve it | I must say that we have had mostly Chev GMC products up to this Honda and we have NEVER had a problem with mice | I am thinking of putting signs on the windows of my Honda advertising what a mouse house it is | 
 "words": I cannot say enough positive about the Honda Pilot | We are a family of four with two dogs and have never felt more safe in a vehicle | The ride is fabulous and sure | Lots of room | Seats 8 if needed otherwise lots of storage room in the back | The best of all in its class | 
 "words": This is a great SUV | Roomier and better build quality than any other I test drove | Very smooth shifting and good acceleration | Quiet ride and responsive handling considering its size | I have the 2WD version with the ECO feature | Seems to work as advertised getting about 18-20 city 22-24 highway | 
 "words": I have had my Pilot for just over a year and have enjoyed it minus a few exceptions | A clip of some type either came off or was not put on somewhere connected to the transmission in the first place leaving me unable to move in the middle of traffic | NOT GOOD | I called the dealer from the road and they towed me in fixed the the ride in about 3 or 4 days | This left me with one vehicle | I wasn't given a good enough explanation of what happened but no problem with that to date | The subwoofer is either popping or rattling the areas next to it | My dealer so far has not been able to fix the problem to my satisfaction | Finally there is a slight pull to the left I will see if the dealer can adjust | 
 "words":  Hoping this was a good cross for road trips AND towing it good only on road trips | Quiet comfortable and great ergonomics inside | Typically SUV bulky to drive handle | Terrific reliability | In short a great people and stuff hauler It is not a good towing vehicle | I have a 2700 tent trailer when fully loaded and the rear end drops considerably and with the severe cut off on the headlights night driving is hazardous due to oncoming traffic high beam warning flashing | It doesn't have anywhere near a low gear going down grades and is clearly not an off road vehicle | Summary terrific land cruiser not good tower especially at night and on any sigificant decline | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle for my wife who stays home with our 1 year old son at the time | So I wanted safety number one and the ability to haul everything you must take when traveling with a toddler | The Pilot does a great job in all respects | It made the 8 hour drive to North Dakota much tolerable with its large cabin space and also large cargo area with the 3rd row seat folder down | It rides high so you would not want to make any sudden moves on the highway as it does seem a bit tippy but on the other hand you need the clearance in Wisconsin if you are ever to make it up north | I give the Pilot props for comfort and cargo room and negative for fuel economy tippy feeling | 
 "words": We have been driving this vehicle for about 6 months and have been very satisfied | My wife is the primary driver and loves how it drives and carries our 2 children 2 and 4 years old | We previously owned a 2000 Odyssey which may have had more interior space but we prefer the SUV layout the Pilot provides | The fold down seats in the rear provide adequate flexibility when choosing to haul people or cargo | The fuel economy is close to if not better than the van however we have the variable cylinder engine | Overall this is a great alternative to the 'Mini-Van' | 
 "words": I own a 02 Odyssey EXL and a 07 Pilot EXL | The family prefers the Odyssey overwhelmingly than the Pilot | The Pilot is nice when travelling alone or with the missus | The kids I have two constantly complains that it is too cramped and they're only three and five | The Odyssey just provides better value in terms of comfort cargo room and gas mileage | The Pilot is the vehicle I use to travel to work | On the weekends it is strictly the Odyssey with the family | 
 "words": I did lots of research on this vehicle and its competitors like the GMC Acadia Mazda CX-9 Ford Explorer etc | the Pilot was my best choice overall for interior quality space and design | Honda's reputation superceeds most makes and reliability is something I am confident about | Well except for the two loose tranny-to-subframe bolts which the dealer fixed about a month ago | We have three small boys in car seats and they all fit in the 2nd row or two in the 3rd | with all the accessories cherry color 29500 purchase price best value for the money safety features confort and reliabity the Pilot has the whole family very happy | We are averaging 21 m g city and highway | 
 "words": I've had my Pilot for 4 months and drive it mostly in town but took one extended 2400 trip | We're very pleased so far | We've found excellent build quality and reliability | Mileage has been good | 18 | 7 in city and 24 | 8 on the highway 65 - | I'm 6-1 and drove 14 hours one day and rode in the backback seat for 10 hours another day | The front seats are very comfortable for extended periods and the backback seat was better than I thought it would be | My wife loves the shifter because it frees up the console area | Steering and engine are great ride is good and after getting a good EOY deal it was 8k less than the Acadia Enclave I shopped | My insurance premiums are less than my old Passport | 
 "words": All in all this isn't a bad vehicle just doesn't have a few of the things vehicles in this price range should have | Solid and great visibility but the kids much prefer the new Odyssey | We have given up on any American designed vehicle and the Big Three and are definately on our Never Buy list but Honda needs to step it up a bit for this vehicle | Basic items like auto door locks auto headlights | and hey where is the ipod jack | I leased this vehicle and will be glad to look at the redesigned in 2010 | 
 "words": I bought the 07 Pilot EX-L RES in May 07 | I have put about 12k miles so far and have been very please with the vehicle | Its comfortable very agile for an SUVvery surprised with the handling not that scary feeling on the curves very roomy | Not as good on gas as I tought but hey its an SUV | The only thing I would have liked is the ability to have both RES and Navi power front pax seat and memory since both me and my wife drive the vehicle and its kind of anoying having to re- adjust everything other than that I'll give it a 10 | 
 "words": I was a little worried about fuel economy but not any more | City driving is about 17 mpg | On a trip to FL | we averaged 25 mpg | One time was 27 mpg | between fill ups | There is plenty of room | Seats are comfortable | There is more horsepower than I'll need | 
 "words": My 2007 Honda Pilot is almost perfect | All it needs is a split window in the back and ideally a power lift gate | Of course gas mileage could be better | Other than those three things I find it PERFECT | I went from a Tahoe to a Lexus to a Honda | I don't know what took me so long | 
 "words": Nice vehicle that is built on a Civic chassis | Yet it lacks the power and guts that the dealer states it has | which is a total letdown | The back seats are very poor | it is almost more comfortable sitting plastic seats in the bleachers | The back seating is not made for long distance tripsjust trips that are less than a mile long to the local store | think twice about these seats if you care about your guests | Where is the power in this vehicle | it struggles to pull what it is designed to pull | The gas mileage is not was it is stated on this site | it is less more like 13 and 17 | Be advised twice before you purchase | BTW there is no AWD in this vehicle | just a myth | 
 "words": Admittedly I don't drive this vehicle much but often enough | My wife uses this car as her everyday car and she loves it | We are expecting a baby in early 2008 and are looking forward to having a safe and reliable car to transport our new one around in | 
 "words": The Honda pilot may have been around for a while but still is very reliable and offers plenty of space and safety comparable to the new CUV | and it is the only CUV that has a true 4x4 ability | It also has great resale value and the look is still appealing like a 4x4 should look not curvy intruding on the interior headroom | I can fit 8 people in a pinch | Gas mileage isn't bad compared to other CUVs | 
 "words": I'll admit I haven't had this vehicle very long but have driven Hondas for quite some time | The 4WD EX-L is very quiet smooth riding and simply a pleasure to drive | Get ready for the shock if you've been in a Civic and getting 35 mpg | Although I do get 21 mpg on the average | This ain't bad | Extemely comfortable ride |

 "words": Bought the Pilot a few months ago | Have been pleased with the comfort and standard reliability of the Honda | I know it is an SUV but the fuel economy is horrible | Averaging about 13 in the city | Might as well have a Hummer | Also rear door does not shut without some force |

 "words": I spent a lot of time looking at all the SUV in the 25-35k price range and went to look at each of them | The Honda Pilot EX-L with Navi has them all beat | The car is extremely solid and is very roomy | So far I have owned it for a week and I love it | It drives like a car but has the functionality of a SUV | To own a fully loaded SUV for under 30000 sticker price 36000 is amazing | It comes with all the cool gadget as Lexus -15000 price tag | It is truly worth the money and will keep its value over the years |
