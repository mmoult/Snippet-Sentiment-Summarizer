REVIEWS
 "words": I originally purchased this car for my wife she really liked the looks | I own a 2007 Dodge quad cab pick-up w hemi you can imagine the gas mileage | I figured the altima hybrid would complement the truck | Ends up I use the altima for everything except towing and payload | I would never have believed it if you said I would love this machine | I do it is great looking good on gas 2 years with no problems and the 200 horses do make a difference | It would be much easier for me to write what I don | t like about the vehicle | 
 "words": I have had the hybrid for over a year and so far have not had any problems and the gas mileage is better than advertised if you take advantage of the car's mechanics | In a Long Island to NYC trip I will average 44 mpg and in highway driving at around 60-62 mph I can get 40 mpg summer time | Accelerating smoothly to 40 mph and then letting the electric motor coast you at 39-40 mph on electric only in afternoon traffic works really well | Putting the cruise control on also improves mileage at highway speeds | But if you need acceleration it is available | 
 "words": Great car consistently returns 32 mpg 600 miles on a tank good pickup and very comfortable | It's the right size too and quite roomy in the front seats at least | It's held up pretty well too although I must admit that dealer service has more expensive than it was for the Hondas Toyotas and Mazdas that I've owned previously | 18 mos 33k mi in I still feel that it's a good value and I still like it | 
 "words": Bought the car new in 2007 and have maintained all oil changes with 0-20w full synth | oil and drive mostly highway miles | Continuous driving on trips of 8 plus hours | Was amazed that the car was producing 40 miles to the gallon on the highway | These trips are on the west coast over mountains and super curved roads | So far the window sticker was right about the MPG except in the reverse | Better on the highway | 
 "words": My family trades cars about every 2 years | This Altima is a KEEPER | Who would have thought you could get great mileage in a roomy car that doesn't look like a cheese wedge | We are averaging between 35 and 36 mpg | It would probably be higher except that I do stop and go driving | We feel so safe with the front side airbags | Acceleration is quick and braking dependable | Beautiful lines quality fit and finish | 
 "words": I traded a 2006 Honda Civic LX 4dr for the Altima Hybrid | The Civic got great MPG and drove well but the seat was just too uncomfortable | I wanted a 4 door with some comfort and about 35 MPG When you look around there are not that many comfortable cars that get 35 | I hope that changes in the future | But for now the Altima Hybrid fits the bill | The car drives great it is hard to keep out of the gas the CVT and engine make this car feel like a V6 but if you drive it like that the mileage suffers | If you drive a little more reserved the car rewards with great mileage | The drivers seat is comfortable so far with 11000 miles on it | 
 "words": I sold my high performance MBZ and became green about 16 months ago | Living on a hill impacts the gas miles I get but I average about 35 mpg on regular gas | The car comfortably seats 5 adults | The design is pleasing to the eye | I got the model without the technology package but has one electric seat and a few minor extras 25K minus the 2300 rebate | The Altima drives better than the Camry hybrid without the clunky shifting from electricity to gas | Since gas prices have doubled since buying the car it was definitely worth the extra dollars over the gas only Altima models | 
 "words": To start I have to say that this is a handsome car | I have gotten a lot of feedback on the way the car looks | I also get asked about mileage 32-33 MPG on average with about 36 MPG city and 30 MPG highway | The navigation system does not have a complete set of data and I have gotten stranded once or twice in an incomplete mapping area | I like the color backup camera and the Bose sound system rocks | The cruise control hesitates at times but you get used to it | Powerful performance feels like a good 6 cylinder at all times | Phone Bluetooth is great too and easy to set-up | In general it is a techno-guy's dream car | 
 "words": The fuel economy is tied to the battery efficiency and the battery efficiency is highly ambient temperature dependent | I found that below 35F I get 35 mpg as rated worse if very cold | However above 70F I can do mid-40 mpg on the same commuting trip | My best record is 49 mgp | That said economically it becomes a gray area to get this hybrid if you live in a cold region and drives mostly highway a plain Altima may come out more economical | Another thing is this car uses synthetic oil | It was such a sticker shock with my first oil change | Factor this extra cost in for a thorough car purchase evaluation | 
 "words": At first I got around 35 MPG like most on here | I learned about hyper milers people who get well above gas mileage by behavior or modifications | I learned by simply accelerating slow coasting to stops rather than braking my mileage stays at 39-40 for city and 36 highway | Simple laws of physics and the laws of energy and motion don't change | I love the style ride interior and going 650 miles between fill ups | I picked this car as well because it still has the 2300 federal tax rebate | It uses the Toyota 2nd gen hybrid system same as camry so I wasn't concerned with new technology When backing out of the garage in the morning the engine starts 1 2 way and can scare you at first
 "words": The Altima Hybrid was more my wife | s insistence than my desire | Was I surprised the style is really nice the room is surprising I can now easily put in the two car seats in the back seat for my grand children | The pickup was very impressive | the hybrid 2 | 5 has approximately 50 more horse power than the standard 2 | 5 | I spend considerable time driving in Boston and Worcester so city driving for me is considerable I average about 34 mpg city and Of course I | m always playing to keep in the EV mode | I own a rather large pickup truck for hauling my boat | I truly feel this vehicle sort of balances out my gas situation | I have owned this vehicle for 8 months and it keeps impressing me | 
 "words": Traded in my 2007 Sentra SE-R Spec V as the ride was getting a bit too harsh for me along with just OK fuel mileage | Liked the style of the car with the twin exhaust outlets and the spoiler certainly makes it a much more appealing car to look at as opposed the Camry in my view | Interesting ride for sure | Have never owned an automatic before 30 years plus of manual transmissions | Pushing the gas pedal gets results but sounds a little strange to begin with and feels like a rubber band is being wound up | Its nippy and no slouch though | A little jerky at constant highway speeds | Feels like I'm driving an amusement arcade what with all the lights and gadgets but very pleased with the purchase | 
 "words": Nissan has done it's homework on designing this vehile | It is sipping gas and has the power when required to pass like it had a large 6 cyl | engine under the hood | The ride is comfortable and positive | Gas mileage is between 32 and 55 MPG | It takes a little adjusting to get the peak mileage | The EV mode is the best part of their design | 
 "words": This is an impressive car overall | Nicely styled comfortable to drive good performance and economy | Handling is secure and the front wheel drive performance in snow is good | I'm getting around 32 mpg in the city very hilly here in Pittsburgh and 35-40 mpg on the highway | The car is very quiet and smooth highway cruiser | When pushed it understeers somewhat but the VDC works well at the limit and is quite unobtrusive | I find myself driving differently in this car working to maximize the amount of time I can get it to run in electric vehicle mode only it turns out to be fun | Between all the safety features roomyness of the car looks and overall driving experience I'm very pleased
 "words": Found the Altima Hybrid when doing on line research for a new car | Liked the reviews and comments | Drove it and was very impressed | It is as close to a sports car as I could get with my size | Believe it or not at 6'9 and 280 lbs I am as comfortable in this car as any vehicle I have ever been in | We live in the California foothills and so don't get much of the city driving | However on the windy country roads I am on EV more than I expected | 
 "words": Replaced my 1997 Audi A4 Quattro and I find driving this to be as fun as the Audi | Have only been averaging 34 MPG which is disappoinging based on the EPA ratings but is nearly twice what I was getting with the Audi | 
 "words": I saw an Altima and liked the looks but it was when I drove the car that I fell in love | The cherry on the sundae was the gas mileage of the hybrid | I live in the hills and get 34 mpg or more and on the freeway I averaged 39 mpg | Pretty awesome to say the least | 
 "words": I drove 9 hrs to purchase the car as it is not available in my state sadly | I look forward to driving it daily simply said | I am getting 37mpg it seems either in city or hwy | The trunk is small but I can live with that | I was filling up weekly now I fill up 1 | 5 times a month | That has made the cost and the 9 hr trip to PA more than worth it | 
 "words": I just recently purchased the Nissan Hybrid and got a great deal | I got the Precision Grey which I was happy about | The car drives really smooth and defenitly has the power of a small block v-6 | The one thing that is going to take getting used to is the engine going on and off | Even though I have only had it for a couple days the fuel efficiency seem to be doing well | It says I'm getting about 38 mpg average right now which I'm happy about and this is a range 65 hwy 35 city driving | The only thing that is giving me problems is the tire pressuring monitoring system which won't go off | Other than that I am very pleased with the vehicle | 
 "words": The gas mileage is excellent | So far I am getting 42 miles per gallon 75 hwy 25 local | I had my son drive the car | He could not achieve the high gas mileage but he has really enjoyed the performance of Altima Hybrid | The vehicle dynamics in my opinion is more European than Japanese | My son and I agree that its behavior is closer to my Audi than my Honda Accord | The Altima's new chassis which has an European origin definitely gives this planted and secure feeling | Finally not having a unique shape of Prius is a plus | 
 "words": I've been so happy with this car | My only comment is that it takes some getting used to when the car switches from electric to gas as it feels a little bit like when spark plugs misfire | I was assured that this was normal however for most hybrids | Also if you live in a hilly mountainous area I live in California don't expect to get the gas mileage advertised but that's to be expected | Great buy | 
 "words": After driving the car for only 30 miles it died on me it would not start at all | Had it towed to nearest dealer | It took them 3 days to find out that the only thing wrong with it is its regular 12V battery that would not hold the charge | It took many calls to Nissan and the dealership and 3 weeks to get the car back | Apparently there is a national back-order on this item and finally they took the battery from another car to replace mine while they are waiting for the factory battery | But I am very apprehensive that I am going to get stuck somewhere | I should have gone with a more reputable manufacturer | 
 "words": Great combination of power economy and style for a very reasonable price | Very quiet comfortable ride | Just put almost a 1000 miles in less than 2 weeks | 
 "words": This car is fantastic much better looking than the Prius although not as good of gas mileage | We have always owned Nissans and always will | I just wish they would sell them in Oregon so we didn't have to go out of state to buy one | 
 "words": I decided that it was time to reduce my greenhouse gases and spend also bit less on fuel | At the same time I didn't want to have to give up my enthusiastic driving habits | To be sure the Altima has delivered on all three fronts | In mixed driving I get 33 mpg | I can do a little better on the highway pushing 36 or so | But between the August heat air conditioning required and living in the Worcester foothills I doubt I'd see anything over 33 mpg even if I babied it | 
 "words": I love this car | I had a 2001 Altima GLE and traded it in for the hybrid | Purchased 10 days ago and traveled almost 1500 miles traveling from NYC to North Carolina and back | I averaged 41 MPG at highway speeds of 60-70 | Coming home we hit a tremendous amount of traffic on US 95 and in the bumper-to-bumper traffic the car averaged 47 MPG | Besides the great gas mileage the car rides quiet and smooth | After driving over 500 miles in a day I still say I love this car | I have the basic model with no frills and with the 2 | 9 financing and the 2350 tax credit the purchase was a no- brainer | 
 "words": Small trunk space | That's the only thing I've found not to like about this car | Everything else is awesome | Straight 10s | 
 "words": First the good test drove plenty of cars even in class above the Altima and kept coming back to this car | I went back and forth between the performance of the V6 and sensibility of the hybrid | Finally chose the hybrid and while it is certainly no V6 this car has plenty of spunk and still fun to drive | Live in San Diego and drive 50 50 city highway | The on board message center says I am getting 38 mpg but based on mileage and gallons I am putting in it is more like 32 | The bad I have had the car 2 months 2900 miles | It has been in the shop over 20 days as of now and still is there | 
 "words": We've had our hybrid for about a month now | It is a very well-designed comfortable car | We get exactly the EPA estimates on the freeway 36 MPG but around town we're only in the low 30s | The dealer tells us this will get better as the engine breaks in we HAVE noticed a slight increase | We have the full package with nav XM and all the right stuff | The owner's manuals stack up to over an inch thick not exaggerating | Lots of things to play with | Everything is designed with typical Japanese attention to detail | I'm 6'1 and fit in both front and back seats with no problems at all | The new body is very rigid and quiet and attracts a lot of looks from other drivers | 
 "words": I love this car | The car is awesome to drive | Must get the tech package | The tech package include leather seat nav sat radio rear cam bose system mp3 ready 6 disc changer moon roof | Comes standard with dual temp push start smart key heated seats and other awesome stuff | The interior is amazing | I love the dash board esp at night | Looks very cool | I compared with other hybrid such as the camry prius civic and accord | So far the Altima is the best with speed and cool gizmo | 
 "words": I bought the tech package taking advantage of the 2 | 9 apr Nissan is currently running | Overall I'm very pleased with the car | It's a enjoyable ride | Test drove Camry hybrid and came down to two | Gas mileage has been up to expectations and was surprised with amount of kick it has no trouble climbing the Angeles mountains | With hybrid you have to get used to the 'shudder' when it switches between gas and electric | Overall I'm very pleased and look forward to claiming the tax credit as well | 
 "words": I've had my Altima for a month now | To date I'm very pleased with everything about it | Most important for me was comfort | I'm 5-9 200 Leg hip and shoulder room are excellent | On a recent long trip I never felt uncomfortable or fatigued | The driving position is great especially thanks to the tilt telescoping steering wheel | Gas mileage so far has been 29 | 5 combinedwith the AC running | 
 "words": I picked up my 2007 Altima Hybrid exactly 1 week ago | I had to wait almost 2 months for one to be located up here in the northeast | Finally one was located with full options including moonroof and nav package with leather | Extremely happy so far | Still on first tank of gas after driving 355 miles of both mixed some city and rural driving 30 city and 70 rural and averaging 38 mpg | I have been able to drive distances of over 2 | 5 miles in EV mode only as long as the speed is kept at or below 40 mph | Interior is nice but could be set up a bit more sophisticated | Had a couple of workmanship issues | 
 "words": I bought the Altima Hybrid with the Technology Package | In my first 1000 miles I averaged 39 | 7 miles per gallon | Since then I have improved the mileage up to 40 | 9 miles per gallon | If you use the energy flow information correctly on the big screen you can really boost your mileage | I still drive 60 70 mph but on declines I back off the accelerator and let the electric motor take over even at 65 mph | When I get tired of driving for the mileage I kick in the 198 combined hp | It has 8 more hp than my 1996 Maxima did | However if you only want the power choose the 270 hp Altima instead | I am enjoying going for 750 miles between fill ups | I am looking forward to my 2350 tax credit | 
 "words": I traded in my 2005 Toyota Highlander SUV V6 4WD as its mileage was only 17 to 19 | The change is dramatic in relation to gas mileage but not to the level I desired | I get average 33 MPG 2500 miles so far | EV works for few miles but then if you need a sudden boost mileage drops down V6 to I4 is a big change but not missing in this Altima | Feels like a luxury sedan | 
 "words": My base Altima Hybrid is a fantastic car that feels like a 40000 car | I just filled up the tank for the first time after 26 days and 615 miles of use | My first tankful worked out to 37 | 7 MPG | I feel great about saving money at each fill-up the 2350 tax credit and reducing my carbon dioxide emissions | The car is very smooth and quiet especially in EV mode | Even with the base model the radio is quite respectable with 18 presets CD player and auxiliary audio to plug in your iPod | The intelligent key is great no more fumbling for keys | There is a good amount of information on the trip computer including MPG hours of usage range to empty outside temperature | 
 "words": I've had the car for 3 months and have over 4000 miles on it | I am tall 6'6 and I have plenty of head and legroom and an adult can fit comfortably behind me | Gas mileage is less than the EPA rating by quite a bit but it's still very good | Average mileage has been 32 mpg | On a level freeway at 65-70 mph I get around 36-38 mpg approx | equal to EPA | With hills the highway mileage drops to about 30 mpg | On city streets with lots of stop and go the mileage is in the low 30s much less than EPA | The best mileage is achieved in slow moving or stop and go commute traffic where I have gotten above 50 mpg | I don't regularly commute with the car but anyone who does should have a hybrid | 
 "words": I love looking out the window just to get a glimpse of the parked Altima hybrid | It is a fine work of art | Rides smooth and handles very well | Decent stereo and A C works well | Intelligent key is a very nice feature but I still go to take the key out of the ignition when I stop sometimes | We did the convenience package in the metallic jade | sweet looking car | Gas mileage is about 34 mpg not quite what we were hoping for but still pretty good | 
 "words": Just bought the Altima hybrid a few days ago | 
 "words": Great car for the money | I purchased the base model only option was the floor mats and the only thing I miss from the Passat I traded in is the heated seats | Drives smoothly accelerates well stops are controlled and handles OK considreing the extra weight | I like the idea of having the tested Toyota hybrid system in the stylish Altima best of both worlds | 
 "words": The Altima Hybrid is a very good car | In my first 600 miles of mixed freeway and local driving I got 34 | 1 mpg | This is less than I hoped but much better than non-hybrid cars of similar size and performance | There are a few problems | The gas engine is rough and the ecu has the engine running too much in local driving | The placement of the big battery creates a small trunk that is tall but short front to back | Long items cannot be carried | I have the base model with strange and limited instruments | The speedometer goes to 160 mph so only the first half is usable with hard to read gradations | There is no tachometer and no temp guage | 
 "words": So far so good after a bit less than a week and all is well | So after reviewing both the Camry Hybrid and the Altima Hybrid I thought that for the price the Altima Hybrid the better deal and several days ago I bought one | Engine has a timing chain and not the belt that has to be replaces so often | My one concern is that the trunk is small and and will just barely fit all of my golf stuff clubs handcart etc | Love the bells and whistles moonroof and nav unit | I don't use the nav unit frequently and leave it off but love it when it turns on whenever I back up | 
 "words": Mostly on 101 Fwy PCH and LA City driving averaging 34 | 5 mpg | This car is amazing | Fun performs well roomy inside trunk not too small comfortable after a 2 hour drive looks good and doesn't scream HYBRID | Purchased purely for utilitarian purposes commuting and business travel | It is a very pleasant surprise after a month of heavy use | The CVT and hybrid system take some getting used to but they lead to strategic driving | One is challenged by the kW meter not to stomp on the pedal to attain and maintain speed carefully and to drive farther ahead down the road | I purchased without tech package anticipating adding portable gps and iPod media | 
 "words": I bought my first Altima in 2005 before the hybrid model came out | I loved that car | It was stylish roomy and fun to drive | I had heard then that the Altima hybrid would be out in late 2006 or 2007 so I have been waiting all this time | I went to the dealer for service on my 2005 Altima and decided to test drive the Altima hybrid | It was an easy decision to make the trade | The hybrid has all the familiar comforts of my old Altima but with the benefits of a hybrid | and the extras that come with the Convenience Package | 
 "words": After owning an 07 Camry se for about a year I decided to trade it in for the hybrid altima | What a great decision that was | Sure the Camry had good v6 power but it lacked in features | For 30k I was able to get a hybrid Altima with every available feature | Which by the way was what I paid for the Camry with no real fun features | 
 "words": I traded in a 2004 Acura TSX for this car | The TSX was almost perfect except for mpg | This one has great styling better mpg more bells and whistles like remote start etc | The interior finish though acceptable is not good | The edges around flaps knobs etc have some gaps | Already some severe rattles coming from closed sunroof | The trip computer needs an improved interface | No complains about performance or handling for this size car in its category | Cycling through information display in the console is tedious | Should do better for model with navi | The music system is good but not stellar | The tweeter was a notch above in the TSX | 20 gallon tank means 700 mile range so 1 fillup month | 
 "words": I love this car | It's really nice to get about 35 mpg and have room to seat 5 adults | The interior fit and finish is nice better then the Camry and Accord in my opinion | The car is really easy to drive and responsive | Getting used to the hybrid system does take a few sessions but once you do you wonder to yourself why all cars aren't electric | 
 "words": I purchased a Toyota Highlander for my wife a few years back and felt the only new car for me was Toyota | I was so close to buying the Camry Hybrid but after reading reviews here I tested the Altima | Sold | I | m a big guy at 6 | 4 | 230 lbs and the comfort in the Altima is far superior to the Camry | Gas mileage is great at 38 | And I think it looks much better than the Camry | 
 "words": Having searched for a car that would not only look sporty but also be practical and economical I chose the Altima Hybrid with the Convenience Package | Despite the thought that the 150 hp engine may not provide enough pickup this vehicle has more than enough power with the combined electric motor | The car is extremely quiet handles very well and has plenty of room in the interior | The stereo is surprisingly strong and the AUX input is convenient | The intelligent key feature is amazing | Overall if you are looking for a sedan that combines a great look roomy interior and gas economy you will not find a better deal than the new Altima Hybrid | 
 "words": After recently purchasing my altima hybrid i knew i had made a great investment | Not only does it drive fantastic but i know it is also a good looking car unlike other hybrids | Most powerful hybrid i drove | 
 "words": i feel like i won the lottery | i am constantly looking at every altima that i see to see if it is a hybrid | and when i see that it is not | i just smile | it is nice being one of very few that actually know about this fabulous car | i love it | it is beautiful sexy quiet powerful roomy sophisticated etc | i am a proud owner | i gave her a name | bought her a duster | covered her seats | the drive is superb | i have had several cars in my life | but it is different once you purchase the 2007 nissan altima | it is truly unexplainable | i am glad that i went car shopping when i did | i have no regrets | 
 "words": Beautiful car that is fun to drive | Lots of interior room and high quality finish outside and inside | Love the keyless function | Never have to take keys out of pocket | The trunk is however 1 3 smaller than the non- hybrid model | Great acceleration with the combined almost 200 hp | Also a very quiet and smooth ride with the CVT transmission | Fuel economy a little less than I had hoped for 31 mpg combined driving in sunny San Diego | 
 "words": I was hesitant to write a review since I feel like I've stumbled onto a great secret | however good work deserves to be recognized | This car drives and feels like a luxury sedan | I purchased the technology package which increased the msrp but I still feel its well worth the price | I am surprised I haven't seen more reviews or people talking about this car online | I always wanted a Hybrid but wasn't a big fan of the Prius' or Civic's design | For me the Altima had the whole package |
