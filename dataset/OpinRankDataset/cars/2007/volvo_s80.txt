REVIEWS
 "words": Just returned from a 3000 mile road trip | Odometer just rolled over 30000 as we returned | Last leg of trip 1400 miles got 31 | 4 mpg with average speed of 65 mph | Best ever | It was comfortable responsive easy to drive at up to the 90 mph we cruised on some Utah Idaho roads where posted speed limit was 80 | High winds didn't bother it | Neither did some sharp mountainous turns | Good job Volvo | MUCH more responsive and comfortable than our 1999 XC-70 | 
 "words": After driving an SUV I was looking for a great sedan that could still transport the family and all of our stuff | This is truly a luxury vehicle and I love it | I plan to keep this vehicle for 200000 miles | 
 "words": I have been extremely pleased with this car | I had never owned a Volvo before but the experience has been great | It drives very well it's comfortable and has been extremely reliable | I get 25-28 MPG driving mostly highways | I would recommend this car | 
 "words": I've now driven almost 7000 miles with my S80 V8 | No mechanical or other problems | Sound of the V8 is great very civil background roar without getting obnoxious | Mileage isn't so bad with average driving city and commute I get 24mpg highway and 18mpg real average | Don't agree the body styling is boring | The old S80 was pretty boring but the 2007 up model has a nice refined look to my taste | 
 "words": My fifth Volvo the best yet | At 23500 miles I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway at 75 MPH with and average of 25 MPG city highway | My car is loaded less rear seat intertainment system | 
 "words": This is now my fourth Volvo with my wife's fifth | I started with 850 then to the S80 2 | 9 the S80 AWD 5cl turbo and now the all powerful S80 V8 | What a machine | Loaded to the gills | Only hiccup guzzles gas like crazy | But if you want power from a Volvo | This is the one to get | Plenty satisfied and sharp design also | 
 "words": this is my first volvo i am impressed at volvo stepping it up this year with a nice s80 | the car drives nicely and is on the fast side | looks great and catching to the eye | ppl are shocked thats it a volvo when they see it | 
 "words": This may be the ultimate Volvo | I now have 3000 miles on it and like it even more than when I bought it | I most seriously considered the Infiniti M35 as I wanted to try something other than a Volvo I have owned 5 | However safety concerns gas mileage and the way features are packaged individually led me back to the Volvo | A test drive of both cars sealed the deal | The Volvo seems to have a better feel for the road | It is smooth yet extremely responsive both in handling and acceleration | It is the best Volvo yet and may have already sold me on Volvo the next time as well | 
 "words": Traded in a 2006 Infiniti M35X for the V-8 S80 | In my opinion the S80 is a nice blend of the BMW 5 and the Lexus GS | 
 "words": Used Volvo's superb overseas delivery program | Drove car in Europe for two months from Sweden through France to Monaco and back through Italy Austria Germany and Denmark back to factory for home shipment | Excellent performance including almost 25 mpg fuel economy | Car was a joy to drive in the Alps as well as the Autobahns | In small towns and crowded metro areas this is definitely a big car | But its size gets respect on the Autobahn as smaller cars yield to this big Swede | 
 "words": This is my second S80 | This car is very quiet handles great super turning radius fun to drive | 
 "words": Picked up a new S80 3 | 2 on June 4 | Over a 2 month period drove to the Riviera back north through Italy Austria Germany and Scandinavia for home shipment | Lots of driving in crowded cities like Paris winding back roads as in Provence Austrian mountain roads and German Autobahns | the car performed flawlessly | We averaged over 23 mpg in what I would consider some extremely demanding driving conditions and speeds think Autobahn with cruise set at 150 KPH | On European roads this is definitely a large car | But it drove nimbly and had no trouble running with the little guys | My Austrian German relatives and friends thought the Big Swede is a veritable Rocket | 
 "words": I bought the S80 because it had better styling luxury fuel economy and safety than the competition | Three months later I'm still very pleased | A recent 300 mile trip got me 31 | 3 mpg at an average 64 mph with air conditioning | That's better than many so-called economy cars | It feels solid as a bank-vault and definitely has that luxurious ambience | 
 "words": This is my second S80 first was a 2000 | The 2007 is a great car and very comfortable | No one beats Volvo seats friends even comment on it | Love the way it rides handles style | Still have the first S80 | I hope this is as good as the first car has been | 
 "words": Wow is all I keep telling myself | I picked up a loaded S80 3 | 2L on a 24 month lease and LOVE IT | I had a 1999 S80 and after many issues with that car I looked to Lexus BMW and Mercedes | After test driving the 2007 S80 and comparing it to the competition the S80 was the best car for the money | It drives like a dream and the amenities are endless | It is simple elegant easy to use and sooo sexy | Only wish she was a bit faster but dealership says there will be a software upgrade for the lag | Simply the best | Already have 3000 miles no problems | 
 "words": I have had a 240 740 850 S70 and prior generation S80 | This is the best so far | V8 AWD Audio package and you feel like you are in a different world | Quiet and agile | 
 "words": Was going to buy another BMW 5 series but wanted something a little different | Drove a few cars but came back to the S80 because of price and the fact that I haven't seen any on the road | While nothing handles quite like a BMW I've been pleasantly surprised with this car | It's super comfortable has all the bells and whistles air conditioned seats nav keyless ignition and is a joy to drive | Plus the stereo system rocks | I plan to put on some 19 or 20 rims | Very cool car with some very cool features | 
 "words": This car is fun to drive gets great gas mileage and is by far the safest car i have ever owned which has become very important to me with a new baby | I have owned both Mercedes and BMW's in the recent past and this car is more exciting and has more cool features than either one of those | there is this thing call the BLIS blind spot information system that tells you if someone is in your blind with a light on the front A pillar | Very cool and useful |
