 "words": I am an avid Ford owner but am extremely disappointed to learn that at 54000 miles I am being told that yes they know there is a problem with the transmission CVT and they recognize the risk it poses to citizens but they are not willing to repair at their expense | I really don't want another car but cannot justify repairing this one |

 "words": I always wanted a Freestyle and found a real bargain in the local area | I've had the vehicle about 6 weeks | Brakes had been repaired before I bought it | Otherwise the vehicle has been perfect | Wife's car and I was a little skeptical as she traded a 2002 Lincoln Continental | It's not a Continental but she loves the high seating and comfort the vehicle offers |

 "words": My fiancee wanted another Explorer even though she had numerous mechanical problems with her previous Explorer | She was talked into buying the Freestyle partly because of the CVT | The car is noisy sluggish and cramped | The capper | The vaunted CVT failed after 50000 miles | The price tag | 7000 | Ford disavows the possibility that it was a defect | Have you driven a Ford lately | Good Luck brother | 
 "words": This is the first long road trip we've taken with our new-bought used Ford Freestyle automatic 3 | 0 liter engine | We loaded the car with 6 adults an 18 cubic foot cartop luggage carrier and filled the somewhat cramped luggage space in the back | This car worked flawless | A smooth effortless ride up the mountain passes and well controlled ride with plenty of brake reserve on the downhill runs | The ride for all passengers was smooth and comfortable | When we did hit those few rough road conditions the car absorbed all but the deepest ruts and bumps | In heavy traffic we were able to accelerate brake and move with ease in spite of our heavy load | A breeze to park and maneuver |

 "words": I traded an 05 Freestyle w only 30000 mi in order to get the CVT which was phased out in the Taurus X | Usually drive machine to 100000 to 150000 mi | An hr of expressway driving with the six spd AT after getting used to the small efficient 6 w CVT made me take the depreciation hit | My 07 has had no issues mechanically and the fit finish is excellent | I enjoy getting away from the stoplites faster than most and no hunting for gears as the RPM's stay up and then come down to cruise | Very comfortable vehicle for 6 adults | 
 "words": I bought this car new and it now has 30000 miles | It has been 100 trouble free and everything works like new | Other than oil changes and tire rotations the car has not needed any repairs of adjustments | It gets great mileage even better than on the EPA sticker | I get 21 to 22 MPG in town and 28 to 29 on trips | The car is extremely plesant to drive and is very comfortable even for tall drivers | The fit and finish are superb rivaling the Mercedes and Infinity cars I have owned before | The leather seats have very good lumbar support and adjust to very comfortable positions | It will haul large loads with the seats folded down and will pull my 16' boat with ease at 75 mph | A great car
 "words": Bought the Ford About a year ago traded a gas lovin 00 Durango for it | Pretty skeptical at first never bought a Ford before but I tell you it's the best for room looks and CVT tranny for nice smooth acceleration | Third row seat is easy accessible for my kids | The AWD drive and traction control is very nice in snow and ice | All in All it's perfect for family of six just can't take anyone else with us | 
 "words": I've owned my Freestyle for just about a year | It has met my needs nicely- providing easy access and egress for my elderly mother with severe arthritis on our many errands to doctors and social functions | Cargo space very satisfactory for road trips and for the possible need to evacuate in advance of hurricanes | I've got the same or greater cargo capacity as I had in my Chevy Trailblazer but with more comfort for my aging mother and much better gas mileage | I also have better visibility in all directions with this vehicle | One thing I am not pleased with is the seemingly light weight construction of the ext | door panels | Very minor bumps in parking lots create very visible dimples | 
 "words": I was a little concerned buying domestic over import had been a Previa driver for years but what an awesome replacement | This baby has power comfort and hugs the road in all conditions including our Canadian winters which are a mixed bag | Biggest test came during 'superstorm' last June | I hadn't realized how bad the road conditions were that night but the Freestyle slogged through everything that storm threw at us and then some | My Previa would never have made it and we passed several others pulled off too | Only thing that could be improved is my city gas mileage but I love the power on the highway and when set to cruise the highway mileage is great for that size engine | 
 "words": Just turned 49900 miles on my 2007 Freestyle Limited AWD | This is the best 7 passenger vehicle AWD out there | It has been through mud sand and snow and is unstoppable | Consistently gets 20-22 mpg in combined driving in New Jersey | Back and forth Florida to New Jersey a couple of times and the vehicle is very easy to handle | Much better in crosswinds than any SUV and just as comfortable inside | The AWD drive system from Volvo in this thing is the best and at a much lower price than a Volvo | 
 "words": Bought a Freestyle limited June 2007 and almost a year later had to trade it in | From day one we had a constant gas smell | Took it in and half a tank of gas later could find no problem | Kept driving it and smell got worse | Mpg highway was around 18 City was 15 at best | Winter was terrible because it would get stuck in 1 2 inch of snow | We had the pebble leather and it reflected in the front window very badly | 
 "words": We have put almost 15000 miles on our Freestyle in less than a year | We just returned from a trip to Florida with 7 passengers 6 adult sized people plus a toddler and luggage | Maybe it is because I don't test drive sports cars but the pro reviewers missed the boat on the CVT and power | 25-27 mpg fully loaded and passing other cars going up the mountains | Too bad Ford dropped this powertrain for more horsepower and poorer mileage | The only problems I have heard about are the premature tire wear and rear brakes | Our tires are ok so far and we'll see on the brakes | I think the writers did a disservice to this car | The Freestyle is not flashy but does what it is meant to do | 
 "words": My car drove very good in the mountains while on vacation | It is very good in the snow | It is a comfortable ride | 
 "words": I have 19050 miles and been enjoying my FS | The cvt is a pleasure | The ride feels tight and secure alot better than my 2001 Explorer or Windstar | I would recommend this CUV | 
 "words":  We went from an Excursion to a Freestyle | We were aprehensive at first but it is roomy and I dont knock my head getting the seats | We have put 7 good sized people in the unit and every on was comfortable we probablt topped the 1125 cargo limit but it showed no adverse signs of handling | On vacation we took the Rocky Mountain passes with again a load close to 1k Berthond Rabbit ears and on the way bak from Oregon and Califonia The Syskius Donner and Vale pass aagain very comfortably | For the passengers there is pleny of knee room fro those in the rear seat has more knee room than Volvo or Passatt and more seating area as well 
 "words": Best kept secret by those dummies at Ford | Why promote one of the best vehicles out there | I'm glad they don't because I would have had to pay a lot more supply demand for mine | Paid 19200 12k miles from a dealer | No question the best vehicle I have ever purchased | Put almost 14k miles on it | Had rear brake warranty work done but other than that it is flat out the best crossover vehicle out there | 28 mpg on highway | My wife gets 19 mpg in city driving and she likes to go fast | More than acceptable acceleration | If I wanted to go faster I would have bought a Mustang | Plenty of room inside | Very comfortable to drive | There are deals out there on these | You will not be sorry | 
 "words": Bought it used with 13400 miles on it | Have run two fuel tanks through it now in two weeks | Great handling for a big car | Much better than the '06 Taurus it replaced | Comfort handling and space utilization is outstanding | 2nd and 3rd row seats don't have any legroom issues | Taller people 5'11 can't use the 3rd row headrests as they hit the headliner first if they lean back | No issues with upright seating position | Worst issue is that with an 80 20 city highway mix I'm getting about 16 | 5 mpg | Worse than I'd expected | Don't think AWD is worth the mileage hit | Engine does get a bit noisy above 2500 rpm | A friend bought an '07 explorer same weekend | He likes mine better | 
 "words": I've had my car since April 07 have gone across country and back driven in the pouring rain I don't worry as much about hydroplanin and love my car | It's big enough for my 6'4-15 yr old son my daughter and our 4 dogs | So many bells and whistles for a price you can't beat | Ford just doesn't know a good thing when they have it | 
 "words": I really searched and researched before I bought this car | I wanted a car that would do everything and I got it | It carries people and cargo like a champ | Even my mountain bike without having to take off the front wheel | It handles great and I love the CVT really great on hills stop and go traffic whatever you hand it | Plenty of Power | I love the cargo well in the back and the way I can flip and realign everything in a flash on the go no matter whatever or whomever comes up | The versatility is the best I have seen | This car replaces a full sized van and a Taurus and does it with style | We still have the Explorer but more and more we keep taking the Freebie | I love this car | 
 "words": I bought the dealership owner's demo model and from the first time I rode in one I knew I had to have one | Dealership uses the Freestyle for their courtesy cars and I thought I might try to buy one of those but this became available and knowing it had the best of care I said Yes | Smooth transmission | so very comfortable | and beautiful inside and out | I've only had it a week but wouldn't part with it | 
 "words": I have had the Freestyle only a couple of weeks but I can already see that I made the right choice | It drives good in torrential downpours it handles well on very curvy roads it hauls 6 family members ages 5-81 nicely and goes onward through the fog without any trouble | The fuel economy hasn't dropped below 20 mpg in city highway driving which is a plus considering it hasn't hit 1000 miles yet | This crossover should have stayed on the market longer | I really think Ford made a bad decision by dropping it after just 3 years | 
 "words": Love the AWD | The varable transmission took some getting used to | Really like how it handles
 "words": I did quite a bit of research before buying my new car | In fact I used Edmunds and the consumer reports as my guide | I liked the Freestyle right away | It had everything I was looking for and then some | 
 "words": Some say Freestyle is Fords best kept secret and it is | Volvo Chassis and structure Volvo AWD mechanism | 5stars crash protection all categories | Highlight is the CVT Transmission silky smooth adequate acceleration with no shifting points | CVT provide great real world fuel economy better than EPA the best fuel efficient V6 crossover in its class | Interior is so quiet like a luxury car so is the engine | Theater seats in 3 rows the rear passengers got great views of the road ahead | All seats are 1st class spacious comfortable | Dash and interior fit and finish look good the grains and soft surfaces felt fine | Exterior style slowly grew on me Go anywhere look | Smooth over bumps etc | 
 "words": We have five children under the age of 9 | This car is fantastic | It has more usable space than our Expedition it drives like a luxury sedan and gets better mileage than a minivan | Why Ford does not promote this car more is beyond me | 
 "words": Really like the AWD | The CVT transmission took some getting used to but satisfied with its performance | The mpg is actually better than estimates
 "words": The Freestyle was a practical choice because rebate plus 0 | 9 financing saved us thousands over the Odyssey or the Sienna and we got AWD to boot | Wasn't expecting a great car but that's what I got | Handles like a dream smooth ride hugs the road on curves fun to drive | Lots of interior room third row comfortable even with long legs | Getting 18-19 MPG in town and 24- 25 MPG on the road | Deep well in back gives lots of room for day to day cargo and adequate space for a week's worth of luggage for 6 of us | Has the best temp | control I have ever had in a car both heat and AC | Set the temp you want and that's where it stays | Plenty of power for my needs even up the mountains of central PA | 
 "words": I just got back from a LONG trip through many states including going through the Appalacian mountains | The trip with my family totaled over 2200 miles | The Freestyle was a great vehicle offering plenty of room for a family of four with lots of luggage | My experience was that it had PLENTY of passing power | The CVT would ramp up to 5 | 8K RPM and the car would FLY by anything on the road | Of course it sounded like the world was coming to an end | Overall there was not much to complain about | The computer said I averaged 23 MPG over each tank which is not bad for a car full of people and luggage | 
 "words": I have found this car to be a joy | The gas mileage is about 5-6 miles more per gallon than my last 2 Explorers | The car rides very well and is much quieter | I expect it to do well in the New Hampshire winters with the AWD too | 
 "words": Just bought the Freestyle after looking at minivans | No real competitors to this vehicle | Decided to go with the Freestyle after other minivans felt too bulky while driving and the comfort was not as good | Took a 500 mile trip over the weekend love the ride very smooth and very comfortable | Also have an Expedition Freestyle is more comfortrable | Replaced a Honda CRV because it was too noisy a stiff ride and fuel useage was no better than 25mpg | Freestyle got 25 on trip very good for a heavier vehicle with V6 | When compared to CRV it's outstanding | 
 "words": Our Freestyle is a great family car as it adapts very quickly and easily | My nine year old son has no problem flipping the back seats when extra cargo room is needed but it is also great to have seating for six when needed | Car handles very well and is easy to drive | I wanted to get my wife a nSUV but not a large one | The Freestyle is a perfect choice for us | 
 "words": I bought this car a week ago and I already love it | It isn't too big and it still has a third row seat and a lot of room | I like the styling because it's not too soccermomish | 
 "words": On a 700 mile trip across WA to Idaho and back we observed 27 | 4 and 28 | 3 average mpg with 60 set on the cruise control | This includes mountain driving passes | Best observed cumulative average was 31 | 2 mpg on level ground west of Spokane to central WA | Exceeds expectations since EPA highway is just 24 mpg for AWD | Freestyle allows chains that are required to be carried here in NW going over mountasin passes in winter with AWD 4WD even if you don't have to put them on | One reason we bought the car was because of needing to drive over the mountains in the winter | The GM Acadia owner's manual says no to chains probably the same for the Outlook and Enclave | 
 "words": A Little noisy when driving the AC is giving me a lot of problems the interior is kinda noisy as well
 "words": Our Freestyle is the 19th Ford we've owned | Started with a '60 Falcon wagon | Still own 7 Fords including our '66 Mustang convertible | Took the Freestyle on a 4100 mile road trip five days after purchase | Went through two major snow storms in Colorado | When a F350 4WD was stuck we drove around it | Went up on over the Rockies without hesitation | CVT is the best thing ever seen on a mountain pass | The added AWD can't be beat | Interior is comfortable beyond compare | A 7 hour day behind the wheel is hardly noticeable | Everyone who rides in it including the 3rd row comments on roominess and visibility being outstanding | Too bad Ford is dropping it | 
 "words": When I first saw the car I did not like it | Once I drove it and looked at all the safety features and options for my family I fell in love | 
 "words": The Freestyle has been the most pleasing vehicle I have ever owned | I can not find anything to complain about | I have been congratulated by other Freestyle owners for purchasing a vehicle they also love to drive | I feel like I belong to an exclusive club | 
 "words": We bought this for my wife to drive around town | She loves the way it drives and is very easy for her to park | I appreciate the amount of room in the passenger seat for when I go with her | We have an Expedition that we use for long road trips so it's great for her and her local use | 
 "words": Was looking for a SUV crossover type vehicle for my dogs and to move furniture etc | with ease | My final two choices came down to the Ford Freestyle and the Mazda CX-9 | Both vehicles stacked up pretty comparably but Ford tagged at about 10K less than Mazda with the same features at the dealer | LOVE the responsiveness of the Ford in handling and braking | Drives better than many sedan models | Wish it had a little more kick taking off but glad to sacrifice that for the MPG | The features are great but the driveability is OUTSTANDING | Keep it up Ford 
 "words": My wife and I planned to buy a SUV since our small Corolla did not work | We went to the nearby Ford dealer | Tested Escape first then Explorer at last Freestyle | Escape is kind of noisy Explorer is perfect at that aspect however it is kind of big for my wife | Freestyle is just perfect | It is also quiet although it is not as good as Explorer | It is easy to drive this Crossover | 
 "words": Very happy with this car | I have two kids a Great Dane and we often take other kids with us so the Freestyle is just perfect | I find the engine transmission to be just great and we take this thing up to the mountains to ski so I think the critics are wrong the powertrain is a strength not a weakness | 
 "words": Had a Windstar van wife wanted something more manageable yet with room enough for the grandkids | This was the ideal choice | Love the heated seats backup sensors and heated rearview mirrors | Interior roomy and fun to drive | Overall a great auto | It has ample pick up despite the bad ratings it got | I like the cvt trans | Only have 2000 miles on it getting about 18 | 5 MPG city | Don't know highway miles yet | Good stable ride and I feel safe with the full array of side airbags | 
 "words": I bought the Freestyle after owning several Mercedes Infiniti and other expensive cars that always were broken and expensive to fix | This Freestyle is wonderful | It is a very user friendly and comfortable design | Everything works and it is comfortable on long trips | I love the silky smooth CV transmission | The car is a nice size | It gets exceptional gas mileage 28 on trips and 21 | 5 in town on regular gas | I am very impressed with the quality of this vehicle and like its excellent safety ratings | Ford is building a great car and the 5 year 60000 warranty is also nice to have | An excellent vehicle and a pleasant surprise | 
 "words": Great ride | Wanted an SUV but not the mileage | Freestyle gives the space of an SUV but has sedan-like mileage | While aesthetics are not the greatest this is a practical vehicle for people who need the space | Would recommend to anyone considering an SUV | 
 "words": This is a great car | I got the base model with 4wd and this car is loaded with very nice features | Ford put a lot of thought into how the driver uses the car and the interior works great | Bose stereo is great | The interior is better designed than most Japanese cars | This car is deceptive in how much room there is inside | It has more room than my minivan | It rides great and handles well | Great brakes | Engine is low on horsepower | Got a great deal | Comes with 3 year bumper to bumper and 5 year engine warranty which is great | 
 "words": I have found the Freestyle to be practical roomy and fun to drive | It handles like a sport vehicle and gives a nice ride at the same time | It is very flexible in that I can quickly convert from a roomy carry all to a practical 7 passenger vehicle | 
 "words": Traded in my 03 Yukon XL lemon and looked for a more fuel efficient wagon with 3 rows | Volvo too expensive | Pacifica close but price features no match | Pilot great vehicle but mileage like other SUV's | Since it's a Ford there is no reason why you can't get invoice pricing | Don't believe ads it's a lie you'll get about 20 to 25 mpg and there is no way you'll get 500 miles to the tank unless you're coasting downhill for that many miles | Overall if you are looking for non SUV non-minivan decent room with 3 row seating fuel economy feature content and price this probably is about the only option | Too bad Toyota Honda Nissan had no viable option | May want to check out Mazda CX9 | 
 "words": Freestyle even better than expected | Mileage really kicking in after about 4000 miles | 19-20 around Town and 26- 27 on highway trips | Love the Nav system | Very comfortable even for over 6 foot person | Cargo room has been great | 
 "words": Not the greatest mileage yet | Hopefully better to come | Ok pickup and pretty smooth ride | 
 "words": After a summer of driving the kids around I have to say that the Freestyle is the great family hauler | Have a 2001 Windstar and decided to see if the Freestyle would as good a hauler as a minivan but with a better ride and comfort | Well the answer is YES | There is not as much interior space as a minivan but I am over it | The Freesytle is great | 
 "words": Purchased this vehicle after having a Mercury Monterey minivan | Wife thought she would like something a little smaller so we drove the Freestyle Limited and we both agreed that this was the car for us | We like everything about this vehicle with one exception | we had heated cooled seats on the minivan and have only heated seats on the Freestyle | Dealer advised me that cooled seats are not an available option | Living in Arizona cooled seats do make a difference | 
 "words": I previously owned a minivan and was not expecting much when I bought into the crossover market | However this car is incredibly fun to drive and comfortable for everyone | After everything I read about the CVT transmission and the horsepower I was initially worried it would not have sufficient power | well the critics are wrong this car has more than ample power | The CVT transmission allows a continuous acceleration until your cruising speed is met | I would recommend this car to anyone needing storage or with a family |
