REVIEWS
 "words": Good looks and convienient very useful cargo space or 3rd seat kids love it too small for adults but this is a crossover anyway not a minivan | front looks outdated it should have been more like 07 cts just a minor facelift could have been a tremendous benefit | Full of anoying electrical glitches sunroof backs up when rear windoes are closing can't be fixed seat belt jammed and replaced twice | Don't buy this car w o a warranty | Very good handling and performance for its size but slow compare to 2010 RSX | Electric rear seats are a slow it should have been manual like acura- MDX | Need better care to built and fix minor problems | Poor mileage | I would buy another one if improved | 
 "words": Steering wheel can not be adjusted towards driver | If you like to have steering wheel close to you and you are tall knees will push against the dashboard and keys | Seating is rather sports car than SUV legs will be very high | TERRIBLE leg room for the front passenger check the narrowing on the left | Navigation system is lousy touch screen is very non-responsive route pink is colored almost the same as the other roads red very frustrating trying to find something on map manually with assisting windows popping up w o need and making the search area narrow | 3rd row seating only suits small kids | 2nd row mid seat tall passenger bumps head against switches | Resale value disaster | 
 "words": I had not bought an American car since the late 1980s and was afraid to try it again | But this car was such a looker drove so well and was priced so attractively that I couldn't turn it up | I have been very happy with the car with the exception of the gas mileage | I do a mix of about half city half highway driving and I manage to average 15-16 mpg | On the freeway I get 21-23 mpg depending on road weather conditions | I think the car could probably benefit from a slightly larger wheel size but as that would only decrease MPG I am happy enough with what it came with | 
 "words": We've owned Cadillacs over 30 years but this is first crossover vehicle | It is exceptionally efficient on ice and snow | Would I buy another SRX | Probably not | When I have passengers in the SRX there is no place for my purse except in cargo area which is very inconvenient | Mileage per gallon is poor and the small gas tank requires frequent stops to buy gasoline | Rear entry door is exceedingly slow opening and closing | Aluminum trim on heat vents on dash reflect and glare badly in both outside rear view windows a serious problem | Lacks interior dash control for rear entry door very inconvenient | 
 "words": After being with Audi Mercedes and Infiniti for the last 16 years the SRX is a great find | We picked up a slightly used SRX4 with just under 1600 miles for 11K under list | We also opted for the Cadillac certification so we have 5 years of 0- decuctible bumper-to-bumper warranty on it | I have already brought it in to address a couple of items like the sunroof being slow stuck and the clock being noisy sunroof motor and clock replaced w o questions | The interior is just about as luxurious as the germans my 12 year old likes curling up in the 3rd row after tiring sports and the V8 performs | If it only got 25 mpg it would be perfect | 
 "words": This car reminds me of the NY Yankees | On paper it just can't be beat | On the road and day to day there are some glaring misses | Unless this is fixed in the next model year I will not buy again | Now my detail A great handler | Excellent solid feel of the road | Beautful look and touch | Quiet and smooth ride | Now the problem | 1 Terrible heat and air control for back seats | 2 No button to open the hatch you have to use the remote and that takes practice | 3 with the rear ent system you only get 1 cd dvd | Just one what's the deal with that | 43rd row electric seat is a death march and not simple either | Nothing like waiting 3 minutes in the rain for a seat | 
 "words": December 30th will be 1 year since we leased this car | Since then we have replaced 1 battery 6 tires all locations 2 front wheels a timing chain a steering rack and a CV joint | While the servicing dealer has been great the fact remains that we still have a vibration or rumble at various speeds | Since filing lemon law papers and bringing back car for last chance repair we are now informed that this is typical usual to this car | They didn't say that the first 4 times car was in they replaced wheels and tires | Otherwise we love the car | 
 "words": I've never written a review before but I felt this car deserves one | I can't say enough nice things about this car | great ride easy to handle sharp styling | Lots of fun to drive and very roomy | 
 "words": I just bought an SRX | It rides so good | We have 2 kids And they do not like to sit in the same seat so the thrid row comes handy | We put in a DVD player | I love the sunroof and the one in the thrid row | 
 "words": Cadillac is unable to resolve a problem with hesitation when going up hills | Otherwise car handles well and is essentially a large station wagon | Gas mileage is poorer than window sticker | 
 "words": I love this car with a few minor exceptions | With the sport package the 20 inch wheels and all black outside there are not very many better looking SUVs on the road | With the V8 it's just plain fast | But I am only getting 13 | 5 MPG less than in the Escalade I traded in | And the Escalade took regular gas | Seats could be a bit more comfortable but not bad | 
 "words": The Cadillac SRX is a nice crossover SUV that is often overlooked by people shopping in this price range who often buy the Acura MDX | I really didn't want an MDX becuase it is considered a mommy- Mobile so I chose the SRX | I am very impressed with it so far it has great handling a nice ride and a very luxurious interior | The only demerits are a couple of squeaks from the cargo area and some occasional wind noise
 "words": Run over curbs and your only clue will be the sound and the bump | The high beltline and the huge poorly placed and conceived sideview mirrors make manuvering an athletic stretching event | It has great handling on the road but my wife and I much prefered her S-10 Blazers for everyday driving and drive thru windows | We have had great service for the very few issues we've had | 
 "words": I am so impressed with my 2007 SRX | The interior is wonderful and very driver friendly | The leather and wood- grain look great | I looked at a lot of mid-sized SUV's and sedans | this is the best of both worlds | We got the 3rd row seating because we have 5 grandkids | Even the older kids love the very back seat | When they are not with us it folds down to a full size storage area | The sunroof is incredible | I will never be without OnStar or hands-free phone service | Both are great security features | The car's phone has worked in areas where my regular cell phone would not | It cost more per minute | but when needed it is well worth it | It is funny to have a car with its own phone | 
 "words": I purchased a V8 AWD with the sport package | The V6 SRX is more than adequate but for a little less gas mileage the V8 makes the SRX that much more enjoyable | Here is a first for me after owning German American and Japanese luxury cars this is the first time I did not need to go back to the dealer to correct a minor or major problem | You heard right no issues at all for the first 4 month and 4000 miles | The SRX drives extremely well very responsive controlled ride very fast and the six speed shifts at the right times even w o electing to shift yourself | Workmanship and the new interior are world class | I am not easy to please but this is the best crossover out there and blows Lexus away
 "words": Large crossover | Handles and drives like a car not a truck | Magnaride suspension really helps with that and is well worth the 1650 | 3rd seat mostly for kids but for the rare occaisions I need it it is perfect | It stores in the floor at the push of a button | 
 "words": The V8 engine works well on flat straight roads | With the mountain driving I do the 6 speed is geared too high and it continously losses powers and shifts even in the S mode | In a 25 mile stretch of mountain driving the engine shifted 40 times in regular drive and 33 times in the s mode | Very dissappointed in the performance of this car | The back up warning is useless the is only a audio warning when you are within 12 to 18 inches of an object and only if your reverse speed is 3 to 5 mph | Otherwise you are required to look about the back window for lights to determine if there is something behind you | 
 "words": I absolutely love my SRX | I looked at these for two years before finally taking the plunge with a 2007 V6 with the third row power folding seat | I wasn't sure I really wanted an SUV since I had driven a luxury sedan for years but the transition was effortless | My husband wanted me to get the Ecalade but I felt that was just too big but the SRX is perfect | The ride is wonderful and I have no problem parking and turning like you can have with other large SUV's | 
 "words": Had an '05 SRX and thought I needed a bigger rig to hall the kids so I got the Yukon XL Denali and then I knew I missed the fun exillerating drive of the SRX | So I'm back | Got the fully loaded V8 all the toys | Rides like a dream corners like a sports car hauls the kids with fun | Open sky with both roofs and AWD for the NH snow | Black on Black | head turning | I think Cadillac missed the call to market this exciting crossover | Fun to drive quality build upscale materials power to spare | You'll love driving the V8 | Now go out and get your Caddy SRX and take to the highway | It's a fun sporty crossover | 
 "words": I replaced my BMW 325xi with the SRX V8 fairly fully loaded | I wanted something fun sporty to drive yet that would have the space for both passengers and stuff for the growing family plus that I could use for visiting business customers | The SRX which we recently got has really blown us away on all fronts | Outstanding interior comfort and the driving experience for a car of this size is just a hair less dynamic than the BMW quite amazing really | Fuel economy is so-so but I expected that | At least it takes regular fuel so there is savings versus premium on most comparable vehicles | This vehicle has the best of all worlds comfort performance fun luxury and utility | 
 "words": We traded in an '04 CTS and opted for the larger SRX | It really is an awesome vehicle | The power is strong throughout all the gears | If you didn't know it was a 6 cylinder you would think it was an 8 | Great ride supportive seats The roof is fantastic | Quiet ride | Paint is top quality | Anyone thinking of a mid size SUV ought to give this one a look | Congrats to Cadillac | Mileage is mediocre 4300 pounds is the reason | 
 "words": I love our new AWD V6 SRX | It has the Luxury Premium seat packages power pedals and is Silver with an Ebony interior | It drives great and handles excellently when tossed through the corners | Having driven it near it's limits at a CD ride and drive last year left the feeling that it could be our new vehicle when our Envoy went back | Who can beat the deal with the great finance rates and rebates I got this one for 500 under invoice with just a phone call | The fact that I bought from the biggest Cadillac dealer in the country might have had something to do with it | I too am hitting mid-15 mpg area in the city but on the highway straight cruising at 75 mph I was seeing 25-27 mpg which is not bad for an AWD 4300 lb | vehicle | The hidden compartment above the glove box is terrific | 
 "words": One day after we got the SRX a snow storm hit | The SRX got around in 6 snow without any problems | The vehicle is very comfortable to drive | It has much more interior room than the CTS we traded in | Its gas mileage is not anywhere near the sticker numbers but it is improving | 
 "words": This is a great crossover | We moved from a larger SUV to the SRX | It drives like a car and still has most of the space of our larger SUV | It is fun to drive | 
 "words": This is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned and the visibility is great | The interior upgrade for this year is very evident | I'm only getting about 16 mpg but the model is the AWD version so I expect it to be less | Early on it leaked oil due to a faulty galley plug which was replaced under warranty | Two rear fender well pieces became delaminated discolored and had to be replaced under warranty but I don't think the color Gold Mist was matched properly | I'm taking it to an independent body shop for a second opinion | If I am wrong that will be the end of it | If not it will be going back to the dealership |

 "words": This is my first Cadillac | I always thought of it as an older person's vehicle | I have one child who plays hockey and so I felt the SRX was a great size for room and comfort on road trips | I am only getting 15 miles to the gallon with a V6 but so far that is the only disappointing feature | 
 "words": We love this vehicle and can really find nothing about which to complain | The power is super the ride is comfortable it looks great | It uses a bit more fuel than I would like but if you can afford a Cadillac you can afford the fuel | Nothing about this car is 'cheap' | The Bose radio and XM satellite radio are the best | My wife and I often just turn into the garage and listen to what's playing | My one complaint is the manual could explain some of the buttons more thoroughly | This car is the very best anyone could want |
