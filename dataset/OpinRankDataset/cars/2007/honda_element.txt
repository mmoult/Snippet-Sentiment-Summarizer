REVIEWS
 "words": We just bought our Element after many hours reviewing the vehicle | So far it has been a lot of fun for our family to drive | We wish the gas mileage was better but we are looking into that | It is just a great car and everyone loves it | We did have to put two baby sun shades side by side over the skylight works great | 
 "words": So like everyone else | my car is my toaster | I love my toaster but I would like to say it rides very rough | It's also much noisier than my hubby's truck | but it's spacey and really fun to drive | My friends love the back seat b c they can see what's going on with the theater style seating plus it is really roomy in the back seat | easy to haul stuff too with the size and versatility | I love it just wish it was less bumpy of a ride | 
 "words": This is one incredible vehicle | Perfect for my needs and one monster beast in the snow and ice | Great interior room looks great from outside and I can easily haul just about anything | Love the fact no carpet to contend with sweep and wipe and it's clean | Outstanding reliability | I have over 35000 miles and have had no issues whatsoever | But then it is a Honda I expected nothing less | 
 "words": I fell in love with the Element when the very first one came out with the exception of the panel on the vehicle | In '07 when I saw the SC I fell in love all over again | This car may look like a toaster but from the inside out it is an exceptional vehicle | I love the room it provides on the inside to how there's no panel on the outside | I've had my SC since Nov | '06 and still have it today with over 37000 miles on it and I haven't had to this day any problems with my SC except taking it in for regular maintenance | I feel it's one of the best investments u'll ever make and u wont regret it one bit | For everyone else who's had problems I think it's the driver not the car | 
 "words": Cons The Element is my first Honda and probably the last | Reliability and build quality was surprisingly poor with subpar components | Tires wore out at 24000 miles all new brakes rotors pads at 30000 speedometer broke at 5000 miles windshield replaced twice with mystery cracking drivers seat cushioning compressed and wrinkled and scheduled services are over priced | The ride of the SC model is very harsh if the road is less than perfect I had to stop drinking coffee in the car due to it too easily splashing | Brakes are noisy even shortly after replacement | Very uncomfortable for long drives due to no dead pedal | 
 "words": I love my Honda element | This is my second one | Only issue i have is that this is the second time that the master brake cylinder went out after about 29000 miles | It was under warranty | I also had a 2004 element and the same thing happened | Kinda odd that it would go out in my 2007 element | I think Honda should check into a internal leap problem in the master brake cylinder | Other wise I love my element | thanks | 
 "words": Okay when my Dad owned one in Silver I totally thought it looked like a toaster | He raved about it so when the lease on my 2004 Grand Cherokee was up I thought what the heck always been a Jeep girl Test drove the Element and the CR-V and to be honest the CR-V was teeny inside my husband is 6'5 and he has plenty of room so do my two boys | I love the ease of a rubber floor with two kids and the special order stain proof fabric on my EX | But most of all Mommy loves cranking up the tunes on the killer stereo system | Super fun to drive own | Better than any Jeep I have ever had more fun to drive better gas mileage and AWD if I ever need it | 
 "words": I love my Honda Element but the blinds spots are annoying when backing up | I have had to replace the brakes on the rear after only 17000 miles | Honda Corp | has not followed up on my complain either to resolve the issue | I have owned many vehicles and have never had to service calipers or replace brakes with so little miles | Very disappointed in Honda in how they handled the issue | 
 "words": I was in love with the element from day one it took me until 2006 to finally take a look inside | I was hooked | In dec | 2006 my dealer found a 2007 kiwi lx manual I ordered and bought it on the spot no test drive needed | I read different reviews for people wanting carpet different shifter location etc | For them I say get a normal car | the Element is not for everyone but good for children pets hauling things and having fun | 
 "words": OK I confess I did convince the dealership to put carpet floor mats and the SC wheels on my E | There I said it | Notwithstanding I really love this vehicle | With the 18s it corners better than my 2007 Camry SE manual did | I am really amazed | True it is not the most aerodynamic vehicle on the road but it'll pass | I love the versatility of cargo space usage | I can get a lot of stuff inside like 6 foot trees etc | It makes trips to home improvement stores a breeze | I like that it takes up less floor space in my garage too | It's odd that a vehicle with so much interior room is shorter than a Corolla | I enjoy my E | 
 "words": I drive a lot of miles each day and enjoy them all | After back surgery I needed something roomy and easy to get in and out of not to mention good gas mileage | My wife now wants one of her own | 
 "words": When I first saw this vehicle I thought it was one of the ugliest vehicles on the road I nicknamed it the toaster | My son and I went shopping with my husband for a Ridgeline | While my husband was discussing the terms for the Ridgeline my son and I checked out the Element | Once we sat inside of it we fell in love with it | We went for a test drive that day within two weeks I had my Element | I love it and now I find it quite cute | It's fun to drive very utilitarian | We've carted everything from a flag pole gardening tools plants baseball equipment fishing poles to our Springer Spaniel with ease | The car makes everyday rides fun adventures |

 "words": We bought a 2007 Honda element sc model silver 18 inch mags sc package right now it has a little under 6000 miles on it and its been in the Honda shop a total of 4 times | First it had a noise underneath the driver side so they said it was a strut assembly | The replaced under warranty which is good still the noise was there | We take it back the second time for another kind of noise on the driver side doors they adjusted them fixed for a while again back in the shop now said they hooked up some microphones all over it and found out the noise underneath is the steering rack | So in the shop again oh yea this thing gets very poor gas mileage the power is lackluster and the windows are noisy
 "words": I bought this car to replace a truck and a mini-van | It did that and more | Drives like a car has the utility of a truck and the comfort has surprised me | I have used it for family vacations football tailgating commuting hauling large items to the dump taking the dog swimming and kayak fishing | I plan to go camping in it this spring | It is without a doubt the most useful and fun vehicle to drive and own that I have ever had |

 "words": I was drawn to the Element by the interior flexibility and suicide doors and it doesn't look like a mini-van | My previous car however was a Subaru Forester and I think Honda could take some lessons from Subaru on building AWD drive trains | This car has torque steer on hard acceleration and there is a lot of wheel spin on wet pavement | Once you get the element going it's a hoot to drive | I am interested though to see how this car will perform in snow a little worried | The ABS works well which will be good for snow driving | I miss not having the headlights turn off when I turn the ignition off although the warning bell has kept me out of trouble so far | I could do without sunroof
 "words": I was first concerned about the location of the stick shift lever | However the location is in a suitable place and this is not an issue | The manual transmission aids the driver to control the vehicle and requires little effort to employ | Both the suspension and transmission handles very well | I preferred the manual over the automatic after test driving both vehicles | The Element | s large interior dwarfs my 1997 Grand Cherokee | Very large or older adults can enter and exit the rear seat of the Element with ease | The rear seats can be configured to carry various loads | This is important to both home owners and active individuals that participate in outdoor activities |
