REVIEWS
 "words": We purchased the 2007 model in 2006 | It was between the RAV4 and the CRV | We chose the CRV and the 4WD for the snow | We had a big snow storm the first year and it did as good as my Toyota T100 4x4 truck | We had the rear Diff problem and had it replaced got free 100k 7 year warrant for our trouble and the fact that the dealer didn't believe us the diff was grinding | We now have about 45k miles on it the tires are still ok one is making noise probably the one that ran over an nail and was repaired | It seems the seats were wearing out quick at first but seem ok | We got the big rubber Honda floor mats that really do keep the car clean | So far so good after over 2 years we love it | 
 "words": We have about 65 km's on it | First off paint quality is garbage the hatch has been repainted once already because of rust around the license plate trim | The car is full of rock chips my sister's '05 Civic had the same paint issues | Had the rear diff fluid changed 3 times at 3 diff Honda dealerships as a 'precautionary service' | They refuse to admit there is a problem | RIDICULOUS | Still makes a noise | Rear pads and rotors replaced at 45km's | Sometimes the car won't even crank over on the first try | My 94 Accord winter beater has 300km's and has never had any serious issues | Honda better wake up and do something fast because they are losing very loyal customers | They lost us | Time for a Subaru | 
 "words": I bought my V new in 07' | It's been a good car with it's versatility roominess and comfortable on trips and great road manners | But it has had some problems | engine replaced drive pulley replaced constant high pitched squeal with AC on at low fan speed found TSB for- let's see if dealer will honor and several squeaks and rattles | I've owned other Honda's including a V which is still in the family w 189K miles but I don't think this one will last as long | I'm def | looking to trade it in already | I'm not saying people shouldn't buy the CR-V but I would advise not to expect the same longevity as previous Honda models | 
 "words": I bought this car for the long haul | What Honda fails to tell anyone is they installed a faulty rear differential and rear suspension and that is why the tires wear out by 20000 miles | Dealerships and main office refuse to fix this problem and your complaints fall on deaf ears | I'm sorry to say the problem still exists in the newer models as well | I'm dumping this car asap and will NEVER own another Honda again | 
 "words": I have driven the CR-V 55000 in a little over 2 years | This included about 3000 miles of towing a trailer a max load | Other than routine maintenance Oil new tires etc | I haven't had any problems | MPG is about 28 highway 21 in town | I wash and maintain the car regularly and it looks new | I use a leather conditioner on the seats every month | The leather in the driver seat is showing some minor wear | This car has been outstanding | 
 "words": Overall I've been happy | Amazing cargo space comfortable fun zippy and good hwy ok city mileage | My beefs 1 This thing goes out of alignment too easily although Chicagoland roads are horrible | 12K miles and four alignments | I take the train and my wife works 4 miles from house | 2 Body trim panels are flimsy | Spending 280 to replace poorly designed liftgate trim | Why so flimsy on a rugged vehicle | I look at prior models and curse the designer | 3 Paint chips and scratches too easily | I have a 2002 Outback that is wearing like iron and this car replaced a Legacy wagon that I sold for top dollar with 110K in it | I do hope this beast goes the distance like my last Honda Accord | 
 "words": Great little SUV looks could be improved with front fairing wrap-around bumper available in Europe | Not good if you need instant response from engine one time I stepped on the gas and it seemed to take a second or two before it responded if that is a safety feature it's the most dangerous safety feature on any car but you get a lot of stuff for the money | 
 "words": I had a 97 CRV and I really liked it a lot | When the new version came out I was stunned at how beautiful it was | Nonetheless I had to shop around because that'd be crazy to buy the same car again | After looking at everything else on the market I went back to the 07 CRV and bought it | I couldn't be happier | I love it | And The green tea color is gorgeous | 
 "words": I had a 2004 Honda CR-V loved it but it rode rough | Bought a 2007 and it was a much better ride but I have had problems with it | Initially I was having problems with it starting | The worst thing is it keeps wearing the tires out | I was told by Honda it was in the rear differential | I am on my 3rd set of tires at 50 000 miles | Honda's solution -pay them almost 1000 for new tires | The main customer service representative was very rude and discourteous | I will never buy another Honda car and will never recommend it to any of my friends again | 
 "words": Less than 10000 miles I had to to have the rear differential worked on twice had to replace tire pressure and master tire pressure sensors at this time the back Windows squeak like finger nails on a chark board when rolling down the rear hatch has to be slammed shut causing the plastic cover above the license plate to fall off the brakes didn't even last up to 20000 miles I am now on my second set of pads I can not drive at a steady speed between the shifts of the because the car vibrates sensor that has controls the cooling fan had to be replaced the plastic splash gaurd under to car came apart the drivers seat is already wearing down sad to say but I hate to drive this car don't buy one | 
 "words": I traded my 2001 for this and the change is like night and day | the new model is much less truck-y looking and feeling and has a much quieter more car-like ride | The gas mileage over my old 5 speed standard is better | with not quite a month of very mixed driving the mpg is around 27 and an early highway trip hit 29 mpg | The CR-V hugs the road better and feels less skittish than the old model in sharp turns | there is a fair amount of thump and bump over uneven pavement but still a big improvement | I was waiting for the new model to come out before trading and it was well worth the wait | 
 "words": I too did a whole lot of research before I bought this car | I bought a 1996 Honda Accord brand new and I have always been very happy with it | I would have bought the CR-V sooner but I wasn't that fond of the color selections | I have never wanted a red car but purchased the Tango Red Pearl | It is gorgeous | I love the way it rides and handles | The short turning radius the back up camera | I just can't say enough good things about this car | So far the gas mileage just around town is in the high 20s I wasn't even expecting that | 
 "words": It is almost 6 months and 10000 miles since I bought this vehicle and just had my first oil change as recomended by the computer at 15 oil life | I get 29 overall mileage 80 highway and 20 city and am extremely pleased with my choice | The vehicle has not given me any problems and I have not even had to check the tire pressure due to its own tire pressure monitoring system | The leather seats are nice and the XM radio is a nice way to kill time on longer drives | The air-conditioner is very efficient | During the winter the CR-V was great in 12 inch snow and the heated seats and mirror were very useful | All in all a great vehicle and plan to get for my wife too | 
 "words": Overall I do like the car | It is fun to drive and has surprisingly good visibility except on backing up | I like the look of the car both interior and exterior | In terms of pts for improvement car has mediocre pickup | Seats aren't comfortable | I find my back hurts after just 20-25 minutes of driving | I've also encountered a number of problems that should have been worked out prior to release | If not they should at least be flexible in dealing with the issue but they're not | We bought 2 Hondas at the same time the CR-V and a Civic | Really wishing we just got 2 Civics | The Civic drives far better and so far has no issues | And it's significantly cheaper | 
 "words": Terrific | No problems after 4 months looking forward to driving it every day | Great ride getting 26 mpg non-highway naviation system is fantastic backup camera is extremely convenient | My first Honda and will not be my last | 
 "words": Just got my new 2007 Honda CR-V EX after having an Accord and a Civic in past years | I love it | It's about time they got rid of that ugly wheel on the back door | I'm 60-something and thought it would be too big to handle boy was I wrong | It handles very well | It is so comfortable and roomy | I can haul anything now from Home Depot stuff to furniture | Honda has always been reliable for me | My Accord went to 180000 miles before I traded it in and I got good trade-in so I expect my CR-V to do the same | Good job Honda | especially for getting rid of that wheel 8 | 
 "words": I absolutely love my CR-V EX but I drive around town all the time and my gas mileage has only been between 15-16 mpg | I expected it to be lower then the EPA estimate but not 7 mpg | I've had this car for about a month now and the gas mileage has not improved | I had a 1992 Nissan Maxima and got better gas mileage 17-18 mpg | I'll give it a little more time to break in and if it doesn't improve Honda will hear from me | I do love the way it handles and the looks are great | Other then the gas mileage I love my CRV | 
 "words": My first crossover SUV and I'm lovin the view | Gas mileage is good average 22 26-28 city hwy of course depends on how you drive | Freeway pickup is noticably lacking it is a 4 cyl | but once you get past initial on-ramp speed CR-V drives awesome even going 70-80 mph | Smooth feels sturdy and the handling is excellent | Stiffer handling of Hondas is great gives more control of auto | Surprised at the power going uphill | Rear hatch is so easy to open close | Road wind noise w closed windows is becoming apparent | Not sure about the automatic maintenance reminders yet | Overall fun to drive and love the features | 
 "words": Just let me say Honda has a winner | Build quality is excellent the ride is smooth and comfortable | I have been buying Hondas since 1982 | I am sure this model will have an excellent resale | 
 "words": After 364 days my 2006 CR-V was totalled in an accident | I got my 2007 CR-V a few days ago | There are some marked differences between the old model CR-V and the redesigned 2007 one | The 2007 has a much softer more car- like ride than the 2006 the seats are more comfortable and the engine is more responsive | On the down side there is almost no practical storage in the vehicle the the cargo nets on the rear of the front seats is gone the shift knob had been moved to the middle leaving a couple of usless holes where there once was a drawer and box big enough to hold CDs | The passenger underseat drawer is useless to the driver | The flip down center console holds nothing but drinks | 
 "words": I bought 2007 CR-V LX after driving a Ford Explorer 2-door sport for 10 years | What an improvement | The Explorer handled and rode like a pick- up truck | Parking wasn't very fun with wide-turning radius | The CR-V is smooth zippy and easy to park | It's also easier to view out the back window than my Explorer | Gas mileage is better by 10 mpg | 
 "words": Traded in my 8 year Lexus RX 300 for a CR-V hard to let go of the Lexus quality and luxury but I felt that the CR-V was a more economical SUV and was in the price range I need to be in with a daughter starting college in the fall | Was impressed with the 2nd row legroom as myself and daughter are 5'10 | The rear hatch is the easiest SUV to open and close on the market | The drive is fine unfortunately just too used to my Lexus to be impressed | The price was impressive for the features | Overall I think that this will be a good car buy for the next several years and that my teen drivers will be safe | 
 "words": My wife and I chose the CRV based on it's balance of safety ratings interior space fuel economy looks and Honda brand loyalty | The fit and finish are amazing mine is 100 made in Japan even compared to my 2004 Civic | The step-in height is perfect for my wife and I and there's plenty of room for car seats in the back seat even with a family visit worth of cargo pack and play stroller suitcase etc | The 166 HP 4-cyl engine has plenty of juice even with the A C on for a combination of aggressive city freeway commute and 2-lane country driving | All of the key driving climate and audio controls are well placed from the driver's position | The ride and handling are superb | 
 "words": Being new to Hondas wasn't sure what to expect | I have the most fun driving my CR-V | Like the exterior design very cute and compares easily to higher end models | Find the interior to be very roomy | Gas mileage is not quite what I had expected for a Honda but still very acceptable 24 hwy city 30 trip | Would like to have more power though mpg would be sacrificed | Find that it shifts to a lower gear more often than I'd like when going on hills | Would still buy it again | 
 "words": I traded in a Dodge gas hog truck | I love the new larger 2007 CR-V | I am six feet tall and I have plenty of room | I am averaging 23 mpg with 90 city 10 freeway | It drives sooo easy | Parks easy | I bought the EX | I believe the little extra money for the EX was worth it | I am adding the iPod music link this week | I tried the Kias | No comparison | Honda's quality is awesome | 
 "words": EPA 23 to 27 | Was that measured while going straight down hill | Combined freeway and street driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control while on the freeway | Hitting reset after tanking up then driving 10 miles in town displayed 15 MPG about the same as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the freeway | This reminds me it did get 27 mpg on the freeway but that ended when the first hill was approached then engine shifted and spun up to 5000 rpm and the MPG display crashed to the low teens | Sorry Honda but this is no gas miser it guzzles | 
 "words": First off it's an ugly car but it's a great car | Function over form is how this car was built | It gets good gas mileage | For those who complain about bad gas mileage you need to learn how to maximize your mileage | Learning when and how to press the gas and brakes is the difference between 20 mpg and 25 mpg from my experience | Lots of features for the money | Nice interior design | Handling is good but this causes the ride to be stiffer than normal cars | As a consequence the car stays planted and doesn't float | This is not a car for people who like a sofa ride | 
 "words": I went from a 1999 CR-V awd to a 2007 CR-V 2wd 1 month ago | The 2wd was difficult to purchase in nw ohio but they found me one | I've gone from 26-27 mpg to 29 1500 miles warm weather conditions | The ride is much quieter and smoother | The power is much improved and more than adequate | Car runs 2000 rpm at 65 | The gas meter 2 trip meters with mpg and and instant mileage gage is great and accurate | LX basic stereo bass is remarkable way better the the 99 |

 "words": Having a great time with this vehicle | It is such a pleasure to drive and the ride and handling are excellent | Not to mention all you get for the price | 
 "words": I have only had the car for less than a month and I have filled up at 40 5 times so far | My R T to and from work miles is 60 per day I filled up on a Sunday night drove to work commuter lot 27 miles away and return on Monday missed Tuesday and Wednesday and I am already at 1 2 tank | I must go back to the dealer | I am not getting even 16 miles to the gallon something must be wrong | Tested with no air windows closed sunroof closed and at about 60 miles per hour and it's like the gas is just leaking out somewhere | Don't buy this car if you have to commute | 
 "words": I purchased this crossover after exhausting research | The CR-V has redesigned itself to look and feel like a high end luxury crossover | Lots of leg room | I purchased the EX-L and love the look inside and out | My best friend also has one and we compete to see who can get the highest mileage on the highway | You cannot go wrong with Honda | Resell and reliability are the main reasons that I purchase one |

 "words": The car is quiet smooth and handles corners and hilly roads well | Love the upscale stylish exterior | Gas mileage is as advertised | And adequate acceleration for city driving | My only concern is the quality of interior fabric for seats and plastic | Scratches easily | Recommend buying the car with leather seats for durability |

 "words": Love my 2007 CR-V it's a major improvement over the 2003 EX model I also own | This CR-V ride is more comfortable controlled and quieter | The interior design layout is much nicer | Bought the EX-L model the leather seats are nice but could be a little more comfortable | The 2 | 4 4-cyl | engine is fine for most driving though trying to accelerate in highway traffic to pass other cars is sacrificed | I'm averaging about 25 MPG in mixed driving which is not bad for this class of vehicle | For all highway driving I am getting 28-29 MPG | So far very pleased with vehicle and would recommend to anyone wanting a compact SUV | 
 "words": Having never owned an SUV before I truly enjoy the driving experience of the new 2007 CR-V | To go from an 03 Civic to the 07 CR-V is nice and I love the higher view of the road | 
 "words": I traded in a 2001 Subaru Outback for the CRV | The CRV is a wonderful midsize SUV | Styling performance and handling are first rate | Standard features and the quality of the materials and build would have you think you were in a 35000 vehicle | Only real negative is that rear seats do not fold flat | Other than that flawless |

 "words": I have been extremely happy with my new CRV however I am disapointed with my actual gas mileage | I purchased the CRV over the Pilot because I believed I would receive better gas mileage | I only average about 21 | 4 | If I would have known that I would have bought the bigger SUV | 
 "words": Just bought it a couple of weeks ago | And so far it is a really nice ride | We traded in our Civic for it | One thing I did notice and always gave low marks to is cabin noise in a Honda | This one has really low cabin noise and is peppy to boot | The overall design is appealing to the eye and that is why we chose it over the large Pilot | 
 "words": Most of our driving is in a suburban area of Florida | We get about 24mpg compared to the Honda van that we traded in that got 15-16 mpg | Our highway mileage is about 30 mpg | The engine makes a buzzing sound when driving around town but it disappears at higher speeds on the interstates | We wanted a 4 cyl | for economy and did not like the Toyota RAV with a spare tire mounted on the back | The Hyundai Santa Fe does not get as many mpg and we did not like the red color choice | We added backup sensors and an auto dimming rear view mirror | Dashboard is attractive with instant mpg readout and other info | However the CRV is not as comfortable as our van was on long trips | 
 "words": When compared to other SUVs and crossover vehicles the CR-V ends up a better value and cheaper than other brands | I am a returning Honda customer purchased for the reliability and ended up getting decent fuel economy roomy interior pleasant ride and the ability to haul around things that won't fit in a traditional car |

 "words": I bought my CR-V about a week ago and I absolutely love it | Everyone raves about how nice this car looks | I got it in Glacier Blue and it's so beautiful in my opinion the best color this car comes in | I'm already averaging 27 mpg with highway city driving | I love sitting up high and the visibility is so much better than my old sedan | This SUV handles and corners like a car going down ramps with tight turns is no problem however it does lack in acceleration but I've gotten used to that | I'm not out racing anyone but getting up to speed on the highways is tricky | Other than that I love it | 
 "words": I have had my 2007 Honda CRV-EX for about a month now | I really enjoy how it handles on the road | The road noise is minimal and the interior design is great | The only issue I have is with the seats as most have said they are not the most comfortable in the world | The new hatchback opening makes it so easy to put stuff in the back | I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a small SUV that is fun to drive and gets good gas mileage | 
 "words": Well my girlfriend and I were all excited to drive the new CRV | It looked so cool with the new design | Of course we expected the reliability and all the nice interior amenities | We were sadly disappointed and we did not let our original anticipation blind us as some have | Cardboard thin and awkward captain's chairs in the front | Skinny bench seats in the back | Hated the missing middle console and combined with the captain's chairs made us feel like we were floating around | No powerseat adjustments in any trim level | Really small gauges and a noisy and wimpy 4cyl | engine sealed it's fate | 
 "words": I purchased the CR-V less than a month ago and I love it | The car is very roomy especially in the back row | I had three of my guy friends in there and they were pretty comfortable | I used to have a Corolla and parking was easy but the CR-V can be pretty tough on small parallel parking if you have the extra 2000 get the back up system with nav | The heated seats are pretty nice | Gas from the three weeks we had it mileage is so so but not bad just don't rev the car too much because it kills the mileage | 
 "words": Got the CRV LX 4WD for my wife and the baby | Nice little car easy to drive enough space for 2 car seats plus a small adult in the back | The car has some great little touches inside like the reclining rear seats folding center console and rear doors that open almost 90 degrees | The conversation mirror is kind of a worthless gimmick however | Two things surprised me one good one bad | First the ride is rougher than I expected especially in the back seat | However the little 4 banger they put in this thing was adequate for city driving and a short trip on the highway | With two babies and 3 adults in the car I had no problem getting up to highway speed and merging safely | 
 "words": Space size and gas mileage | Wow | I get a whopping 28MPG in mixed city hwy driving | This SUV is smart sexy and smooth | Love the XM radio | My first Honda and I am sure not my last | 
 "words": I was looking to purchase a car for the last 6 months I read reviews studied test drove etc | I spent so much time looking to find perfect car as I took such a hit on depreciation on my last car I didn't want it to happen again | After studying and comparing the Toyota Camry Saturn Aura and Jeep Patriot I ran into this car | It swept me off my feet | With all the stuff I got it is pretty much the same price as the Patriot but you get the durability of this car and the great fuel economy | Right now mostly freeway I'm avg 28 | 2 mpg | Black on black is fantastic looking plus the Navigation | You can change color of navigation | 
 "words": Got the '07 CRV AWD as a commuter work horse and it serves its purpose | But after reading other reviews I wonder if our CR-V is just off | Even after 5000 miles best I have ever gotten is 22-24 mpg on pure freeway driving with no stop and go | I expected much better gas mileage | Really needs a 6 cyl particularly given the extra weight the AWD puts on the vehicle | Really struggles to maintain freeway speeds 70 mph on inclines | Overall it's a decent little SUV | I guess I can't expect it to drive or perform like a 50K SUV | Wish I could tell when the AWD engages | 
 "words": This is my first ownership experience with a Honda and so far I love it | What appealed to us the most other than gas mileage and reputation was the ground clearance and seat height adjustment | Both of us have some back troubles and most sedans sit too low to the ground | You literally have to pull yourself up of those low seats | But not with the CR-V | It is easy to get in and out of | It is probably the most practical vehicle we have ever owned | I did much research on the internet and compared CR-V with many competitors | None of them matched the CR-V in quality standard options or price | Love my Honda CR-V | 
 "words": Handles and accelerates well while still being more economical than V-6 alternatives | Two wheel drive is more than adequate in northern urban areas | AWD would be better for rural commutes in winter or in heavy snow belt areas | Excellent heater and heated mirrors appreciated in Canada | Many thoughtful and functional items in the standard LX model | Our choice was between the Accord or the CRV | Both had nearly identical MSRP | The CRV is much more useful and has Vehicle Stability Assist included | Exceptional feeling of spaciousness for the driver and passenger | Residual value of the CRV has been excellent for many years I never truly understood the whole CRV thing until I bought one | 
 "words": Loved this car when we first picked it up after driving a couple of 10 year plus old cars | But with some time behind the wheel the CRV does have some faults | Seats are uncomfortable very noisy cheap interior materials tire monitor light that comes on when it's cold out and try rolling down the back windows at highway speed terrible wind rumble noise | Performance and reliability should be good and of course the safety factor | All in all a good car but not one to fall in love with | 
 "words": I love driving this car | It is very classy yet practical | The exterior is very sleek and attractive | I have the royal blue pearl exterior with black leather interior | It has a lot of kick for a 4 cylinder | I have gotten a lot of compliments especially from a current 2002 CR-V owner who now wants to upgrade | I was contemplating buying the RAV-4 but the features available on the CR-V along with the appearance far outway any other SUV in its class | The safety features are amazing and got me a low insurance rate | I previously owned a Civic and I now only pay 60 more a year which is quite reasonable | Overall I highly recommend this car to anyone considering buying a mid-size SUV | 
 "words": I loved the CRV | It was the best car I had ever gotten | I wish it came in a manual shiftstick though | I would have loved it more | 
 "words": We puchased this SUV to replace my wife's Passat Wagon | We weren't sure which we wanted another wagon Volvo XC70 or an SUV | We saw this on the road one day and the wife loved it | It has just enough cargo space spacious passenger cabin fun and easy to drive very safe the award winning VTEC Honda engine and great fuel economy for a decent sized SUV | Nicely equipped excellent build quality and famed Honda reliability | The engine is responsive and quiet | We were sold on the CR-V after the test drive | 
 "words": Pros Ride handling navigation and fuel economy | Before buying car I thought power is not enough on the highway but with little bit of acceleration you have the power you want | I am not a sort of fast driver so power is more than enough for me | The car handles very smoothly and it is comfortable | Road noise is like other good car | I can't understand why some people are talking about it | Interier is really nice all the buttons on the steering lightup when head lights on | 
 "words": This SUV has great style both inside and out | This a a great car if you have one or two kids and the dog | It's actually less than advertised in the city and pertty good in the hwy | I just think it really lacks on pick up | It needs more power | Would have been great in a V6 | 
 "words": Hondas are great cars | I'll probably always buy Honda | I traded in my 1999 Honda Odyssey EX121000 mi | pretty impressive | in for the 2007 ex 4dr awd CRV 6 months ago | I love it | Darn good get up and go for a 4 banger | I have only one complaint Honda next time use the same fabric the the CRV that you put the Odysseys | 
 "words": Excellent vehicle | I put 240000 on my 99 CR-V | Im getting 28 MPG on the highway | The new model rides a little rougher but it's more comfortable | The 2007 has a lot more horsepower nice handling | 
 "words": This is the most efficient vehicle i've yet owned | Great MPG and requires only regular gas and is an SUV at that | Nice turning radius and maneuverablilty but a little too much braking pressure is needed to stop | Pick up is adequate | Love the nitro gas tires | Wish the armrests were independently adjustible as I recline more than most others do while driving don't worry- not so much that I'll sleep | The armrest is stationary so it rises to a more obtuse angle which means more awkward contact with the steering wheel despite wheel telescoping and tilting | Love the car so far and my only wish other than the above is that the driver seat be multi-powered the EX-L be powered | 
 "words": I am not a big fan of SUVs | I test drove this after reading the rave reviews and bought it after extensive research and test driving of cars | The 4 cyl is extremely refined and has adequate power and a decent fuel economy for an SUV | The CRV is extremely athletic and very car like in its handling felt sportier than the 07 Camry RAV4 but not as much fun as CX-7 | There is some wind noise at highway speeds but it is not very significant | Extremely well finished interior Camry had uneven gaps in the plastic and I love the display | Definitely sexier than the boxy 06 CRV | Wanted the Honda reliability and this car has a decent gas mileage | Overall a great value | Will get Z4 G37 in a few years |
