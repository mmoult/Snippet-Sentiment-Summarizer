REVIEWS
 "words": This is my wife's car and she loves it as much as me | Strong engine great ride handles like a car and she loves the no touch AWD | I know she and my boys are safe in any situation | Did I mention it is fun to drive especially with the auto stick shift | 
 "words": I previously owned a Mitsubishi Montero Sport which I drove for 10 years | Hated to get rid of it so I thought another Mitsubishi would be a good purchase | Gas mileage has been 18 mpg consistently less than what I got in my MS which was 19-20 mpg | It it a bigger SUV | Seats are comfortable and great room inside | I have used the back for moving large items and have taken several trips with dog crates so if you need cargo storage this vehicle can handle the load | Because I loved my Montero Sport so much I do compare the two vehicles | 
 "words": We bought our Endeavor after owning a 2004 Lancer Ralliart to have more room and cargo space | We absolutely love it | It's comfortable rides great and has plenty of power | We have also only run 87 octane and have not had any problems or noticeable loss in gas mileage | 
 "words": I shopped around for about a month or so for a few Ford Trucks | I went by accident by the Mitsubishi lot because I was driving around the auto mall and saw the Endeavor and there was only two left I drove it and was like WOW this drives just like a car I do go on occasional trips and its great | It has every thing I could ask for great sound great ride | beautiful interior and decent gas mileage for the size | I would recommend this car to anyone and if i ever get another car it will be a Mitsubishi for sure | 
 "words": Traded in a Buick SUV that did not make it past 85K miles | Test drove the Honda Pilot and Outlander prior to buying my Endeavor | The Endeavor outperformed the Pilot had much smoother ride and comfort | The Outlander was in the running but was just a bit to small | After rebates got the Endeavor for the same price as the Outlander | This SUV rides like a car | Very stable and lots of room | Averaging 18 | 5 MPG with 50 city 50 highway with 6k on the engine | Hoping it gets a little better | I only used premium gas for the first fill up from the dealer | Runs fine on regular | 
 "words": I test drove a lot of midsize suv's before deciding on the endeavor | I had a 2004 Tahoe z71 and traded it because I wanted better gas mileage and a better warranty | This vehicle is so nice to drive feels stable great gas mileage my kids and all their gear fits comfortably in this car | And it can tow our four wheelers without a problem | The sound system is awesome with the subwoofer | By far better than the others for the price | We got the dvd system and the kids love it when we are on road trips | Great investment | 
 "words": We have had the Endeavor for 1 year and is very pleased | We use REGULAR GAS in it without any ill effects | Averages 19-20 MPG | which is better than My Honda Pilot EX | Build quality is not yet up to Honda standards | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle after painstaking research and test drives of so many others similar in this class | I have to say that have no regrets with my decision for many reasons | I had used this forum as the basis for my final decision and most of the other reviewers and I are in agreement | Overall one of the best deals out there | I live in a snow region and my first driving experience was during a blizzard | While other SUVs and 4WD vehicles where busy with low speed flashers I cruised along effortlessly among the pack | Smooth ride lots of midrange power very roomy and excellent driver response | Did I mention my insurance rates dropped lower than another vehicle I own a 1997 Passport | 
 "words": LOVE THIS CAR | Handles great and fun to drive | Never had any trouble with my 2004 or my new one | Will buy another in the future | Lou Fusz made it so simple and were very nice | 
 "words": 1- It needs PREMIUM gas or it runs very poorly weak and low MPG 2- Engine has good power but only with PREMIUM fuel 3- PREMIUM fuel is very expensive | 4- Cheap tacky plastic fittings in the interior 5- Good interior room | Comfortable seats 6- Exterior styling is hard to get used to | I bought this SUV and now I regret it | Before you buy an Endeavor be sure you know that PREMIUM fuel is required | It gets VERY expensive to operate this along with the poor gas milage 15 city 20-21 hwy that's with the expensive Premium gas I know other people like this SUV but I can't afford PREMIUM gas all the time | 
 "words": I LOVED my Endeavor | until I got into a 6 car pile up caused by MY endeavor | The car ran perfectly was SO much fun to drive and it looked and felt brand new even after a year of driving | In a snow storm I was moving 15 mph and a simply tapped on my brakes slightly the brakes locked instantly caused me to slide across the divider into oncoming traffic | There was NO reason the brakes should have locked | The insurance adjustor agreed with me | The body structure allowed for my survival but it wouldn't have happened in the first place if my brakes didn't lock | Don't go for looks alone and be careful if you purchase it | 
 "words": The vehicle handles like a car | Needed a vehicle big enough to ride a family with two big kids | The kid | s first comment was wow they love the leg room | Everyone sits good | Not clunky like other SUV | s I owned | 
 "words": This has got to be my fav car to own so far | I have owned many I also test drove many SUVs before buying this one | I love it it is roomy yet not to large | There is enough room in the back for the kids and there uncle | and they are comfortable | The kids don't complain that there is no room | There is also great leg room in the back for taller people | My brother is 6ft and he fits back there just fine | Never have a complaint | 
 "words": I traded a Lexus for this vehicle and it is one of the smoothest riding SUV that I have ever owned | Gas mileage is outstanding and it has so much leg room and head clearance that it is the perfect SUV that a person can and will ever drive | 
 "words": My wife and I have driven ours over 3000 trouble free mostly highway miles | We're more pleased with our purchase now then when we rolled it off the dealer's lot | This is a very good highway vehicle | One of my biggest concerns about a vehicle of this type was how well it would handle cross-winds and truck wash | Well it is no longer a concern | It's the most stable vehicle I've owned in those conditions | This SUV should not be the well kept secret that it is | The Endeavor is a must drive for those in the market for a mid-size crossover that don't require a third seat | 
 "words": About 1000 miles now really great overall product | Responsive fun to drive peppy really nice ergonomics and fuel efficiency has been surprisingly strong at over 22mpg consistently | Drove everything on the market 4runner LR2 you name it this is really the best overall package for the best price | 
 "words": I tried a bunch of SUVs and did my homework before buying my Endeavor SE two months ago | I made the right choice | I just couldn't find a better deal for the money | It's got great looks ride terrific stereo room for everything torque and performance not to mention a great warranty | I got just about every option available I plan to keep it a long time | Navigation system could be better by mentioning street names like the Gremlin and not talking so much | I got a 2005 DVD navigation disc instead of a 2007 or 2008 version | Going to have to call | Folding the back seats I had enough room for several 6 foot long picnic tables inside and I could close the hatch | My girlfriend loves it | 
 "words": If you drive this truck it is impossible not to buy one | Every thing about this SUV is great the looks the interior performance warranty and safety | I bought this truck for my wife and I end up driving it more then her because it is so much fun to drive | 
 "words": I am comparing this vehicle directly to my 2006 Honda Pilot EX | The Endeavor SE with Navigation is very easy to drive | I love the 360 watt sound system | It is heads and shoulders above the 6 disc sound system that is available in the Honda Pilot EX | 
 "words": I have test driven all of the competition and found that the Endeavor is unparalleled in comfort and ergonomics | If you are searching for an SUV that is an all around great bargain search no further | I still can't believe all the standard features and 10yr 100k warranty at this price | It is definitely worth your time to test drive one | 
 "words": This is my second Endeavor | I've test driven several other comparable SUVs and nothing compares | It's reliable comfortable and most important fun to drive | I love it | Cindy
 "words": The Mitsubishi Outlander is fun fast roomy and affordable | I've owned numerous cars and SUVs | The Endeavor is the best riding and most ergonomic vehicle I have ever owned |
