 "words": I test drove all the compact SUVs on the market and finally decided on the Tucson | I never would have considered a Hyundai didn't know anything about them as they are not widely driven in my area but was suggested by a friend in another state because of the warranty | I read every review out there and liked what I read | I loved the car when I drove it and it had all the options I wanted standard that I would pay thousands extra for in my other choices Subaru Forester and Jeep Patriot were my top 2 | I prefered the gas mileage and styling of the Patriot and reliabilty of the Forester but when it came down to it the Tucson won out overall | It is a very stylish car and fun to drive | 
 "words": I started out looking at the Ford Edge the Honda CRV and the Mazda CX-7 | The Tucson wasn't even on my radar | The need for premium gas nixed the Mazda and 34000 plus change for an Edge with the sunroof gave me pause but I was ready to buy | The warranty and standard saftey features of the Tucson made me take a look | I expected to be underwhelmed during the test drive but was pleasantly surprised | After driving a Jeep Wrangler for 11 yrs the Tucson had the soft quiet ride I was looking for | The Limited offered a lot of bang for the buck and I bought one for 24650 OTD | The 10000 dollar savings sealed the deal | Very pleased after 1100 miles | Still in love |

 "words": I am so in love with this car If I could marry it I would | I got the Desert Sage Base level model but even with that the SUV comes loaded with lots of things standard | I had an Elantra two of them actually so the fact that this is built on an Elantra carriage is great | It rides like a car but I am ever mindful to not take corners like Speed Racer | I have the 4 cyl so there isn't a lot of pep per se and it feels sluggish on accleration but I just plan accordingly | Sound system is great in the interior cabin | I like the fold down seats and the lumbar support but it would be nice if the passenger side front seat had lumbar support as well | Overall it's a GREAT car for the price |
