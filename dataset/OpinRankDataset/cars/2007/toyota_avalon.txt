REVIEWS
 "words": This is my 2nd Avalon first was a '98 XLS and have been disappointed in quality | AC hose clogged at 35k miles soaked ruined the carpeting | oil line broke 28k miles and I lost all engine oil on the road | Added oil to limp into the dealership | Engine noise ticking exhaust makes it sound like an old Chevy | Paint quality is average | I want my '98 Avalon back | 
 "words": The gps system is effectively inoperative | You can't get the enter key to hit a letter or other item with any sort of reliability | Entering a street name could take twenty minutes | The dealer here in Newark De said that this is typical and fixing would cost a small fortune | So I use a 150 garmin | Pathetic don't you think | I have about 50k miles on the car | Also the seat heaters stay on all the time so I had to disconnect the fuses so I lost that function | I am a little disappointed in the car for these reasons | Other than that it has a beautiful ride with excellent mileage | My next car will not be an Avalon I may go to a Buick or a Lexus | 
 "words": This is a beautiful car | I previously owned a Nissan Quest so the transition to a car was tough | But the handling and styling on this car made up for the loss of space | I'm surprised more people don't spend the extra money and upgrade from the Camry to the Avalon | It looks like a Lexus | 
 "words": First of all I am 6' 6 and 320 lb's and find it very comfortable | I took a trip out to the west coast and doing 80 mph I was getting 34 mpg | The engine is quiet and smooth transmission shifts just fine maybe I'm lucky but I never needed any kind of service except for oil and filters | Its a great car and I'm just waiting for the new model year to get another one | I now have 39000 miles | 
 "words": I purchased a 2007 Avalon after my 2006 was declared a total loss | My car was trouble free until 55000 miles when the check engine light went on | The AC was broken O2 sensor gas tank and a list of other items brought the repair bill to 4500 | If it were not for CA emissions warranty I'd have to pay the entire thing | I'm still on the hook for 2000 | The dealer was fine but I'll never buy a Toyota again- my Chrysler was more reliable | 
 "words": Talked to some Avalon owners before making purchase | Have had the car for two years putting 15k on per year | Overall we are pleased | It has great design size ride performance and comfort expected | Replaced the OEM Michelin tires at about 27K with some Yokahama | The OEM still had tread but not enough for winter driving | Problem to date is what appears to be a gap missing bushing or poorly fitting parts somewhere in the steering assembly | After stopping there is a slight drop in the steering wheel of about 1 8 inch with a little klunk when we start again | Dealer replaced steering assemble shaft but problem still exists | Having hard time replicating when we take it in | 
 "words": Before buying this car I heard great things about Toyota vehicles from friends and family so I decided hey I have to get one for myself | What a joke this car makes me sick | It has a very loud noise in the engine | I have taken it in too many times only to be told by the mechanic that he does not hear the noise | These guys must be deaf | The last mechanic told me that the noise is normal that the sound was in other cars he tested | Transmission horrible to say the least not smooth at all | Sound system cannot be heard over noisy engine brakes are terrible problem with wipers in all one of the worse vehicles I have ever owned | I can't wait to get rid of it | 
 "words": Best car I've ever owned and first non-USA model although was mfd in KY | Brakes are fantastic economy much better than anticipated usually 30 on hwy if driven around speed limit | I don't agree with the raps on the seat comfort I'm pretty big and it's fine | Handles great | Have had many of the minor problems reported by others Tranny shifting improved by TSB re-calib | Just encountered famous windshield washer hose problem | Paint issues like everyone else | Lack of fold-in mirrors inexplicable | Strongly recommend dealer installed side molding | But I still love this car |

 "words": At first I wasn't very impressed with the car until I drove it | It was great | My husband is over 6'6 he actually picked out the car first he was very comfortable seated in it | Both my kids are over 5 feet all and they are between the age of 9 and 11 | I am 5' 9 I am sure the son will enjoy this car when he is 16 | I hope | Thanks to my husband for introducing the Avalon | It's great |

 "words": Bought the Limited and was sold on the smooth almost silent ride super engine and trans performance great looks and the luxurious interior | For us in Florida the perforated and ventilated leather seats sold us on this trim level | No more sweaty back | Worried about door dings in the beautiful white pearl paint so bought the factory color matched bodyside moldings for 150 and installed them myself in about 20 minutes | They enhance the appearance | I hope the mileage is as rated | Advantage w the Avalon over much of the competition is regular fuel | 
 "words": We've had our XLS since August 1700mi and love it | Bought it at 400 under invoice | Tough decision between the Lucerne and the Avalon as I've always bought GM but don't regret it in the least | The Buick is nice nearly identical feature to feature and had a larger trunk but the 3 | 8L engine and 4-spd transmission did not compare to the Toyota's 3 | 5hp and 5-spd in power and smoothness | 3 | 8L was the same setup as my '97 Bonneville bulletproof but not as refined as one would expect in the Lucerne | The Avalon handles well has oodles of power is very comfortable on long trips has plenty of room for the family and great looks to boot | I'd recommend it to anyone |

 "words": Had a I-30 Infinity not interested in competing with BMW more interested in a smooth driving and riding machine | Which is what you get with a Avalon | Limited has all the bells and whistles that Infinity offers plus more at a much better price | Love the room inside the smart key the great gas mileage the memory outside mirrors the rain activated windshield wipers etc | I think the interior looks great | I love the attention to details when you spritz your windshield to clean it the wiper makes several passes pauses for about 10 seconds and makes a final pass to clear any drips | If the rear sunshield is up it automatically goes down when you put the car in reverse | Cool | 
 "words": I have owned my Avalon for about three weeks now and it is absolutely amazing | First look it seems like a grandma car that wouldn't be fun to drive but it is just the opposite | I love the way it accelerates 0-60 in 6 | 6 secs | and it is so easy to drive | I purchased an '07 for 1200 below invoice | Toyota designed the Avalon very well and made it very practical | Every button serves a purpose | Dealership was fast nice and easy to work with | I love my car and think that for the money no other car compares | 
 "words": For 30 years i've owned nothing by GM products | My wife talked me into buying the 07 Toyota Avalon and I'm glad she did | I was about to buy a Buick Lucerne but after driving the Avalon it was no contest | I do think the Lucerne has more of a plush ride but the Avalon rides very well also | Other that no comparison | Avalon blows the Lucerne away in every other dept | More power better gas mileage much much nicer inside and in my opinion the Toyota is a very well made vehicle | You can tell that just by closing the door | Solid | And of course there's Toyota's reputation on dependability | My only dissappointment is that I waited so long to swith over to a Toyota | So far I love this car

 "words": Toyota's flagship is a great car of course there are some bugs | The heated and ventilated seats sacrifice comfort for a little cool air on your bottom | Using synthetic oil I can get 33 mpg on flat interstate | Around the mountains I average 24-28 mpg | I convinced my dealer to put some extra padding in the drivers seat and the service manager only did this because the leather had a crease in it | They refused to fix the passenger seat so it's like sitting on a block of wood well maybe not that bad but compared to other seats it's pretty bad | I am going for a Lexus ES 350 next time |

 "words": The seats in this Avalon are terrible more uncomfortable than you can imagine | Why would a designer put all kinds of seams in a car seat | The steering is also hard not smooth like in our 2003 Avalon | It feels like I'm driving a Mack truck | The radio sounds like an old transistor AM radio tinny and poor quality | I've also had major problems with merging onto interstates from entrance ramps | sometimes I wonder if I'll make it without being rear ended by a car 1 4 mile behind me | The pick-up is not reliable | Cabin noise is very loud on interstates mostly from moonroof | Overall if you are a small woman who is looking for comfort and a great car for road trips the 2007 Avalon is not it | 
 "words": Just about everything about this car is great at the price paid it should be | It does have a few shortcomings the trunk lid closes like a piece of tin | The dealer said nothing can be done about it and the back bumper where it fits along the side is a poor fit | Overall the car is joy to drive | 
 "words": This is the second Avalon that I've owned and the 2007 is much nicer than the 2004 I traded | Test drove Volvo S80 Saab 9-5 and Lexus ES 350 | The Avalon while not having the panache of the other brands is by far the best value for the money | Beautiful interior contemporary exterior and the powertrain is responsive |

 "words": We are very disappointed in this vehicle for many problems | First the air bag light came on and it took the dealer 5 mos to get repaired | The car tracks to the right and the dealer took 7 mos to repair after repeated denials of a problem | The problem apparently was caused by being lashed down too tightly while being transported | The transmission is jerky slips and clunks at times | The engine is loud apparently w o adequate padding | Visibility while backing is poor | There is a glare on the ample dash | The remote start must be operated perfectly for it to work | Don't hold the push start button or else it will crank down just tap it | You have to slam the trunk to close | Good luck |
