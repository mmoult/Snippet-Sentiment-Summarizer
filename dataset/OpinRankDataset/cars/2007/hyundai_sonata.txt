REVIEWS
 "words": I have had the car since 2007 | A great car to drive but I have had many problems | Check light comes on for no reason sometimes | Trunk would not close one day | Visor would not stay up | Drink holder broke | Car jumps a bit when I change from 1st to 2nd sometimes | About 2 of the time | Electrics are been faulty and I have had to replace 4-5 bulbs | I think that is about it | Quite alot though | The warranty is great and they have repaired everything but I am tired of taking it into the shop for repairs | Nice car but just too many problems for me to consider buying another Hyundai | 
 "words": Overall I have been pretty happy with my 07 Sonata GLS | No technical or mechanical issues yet after 20000 miles | My biggest problem has been the suspension which is designed for a light bicycle | Bumpy roads provides very strong feedback into steering wheel | Bottoming out is donw easily | So you Hyundai engineer lear from Honda Accord | 
 "words": I have owned my Sonata for 3 years now and the only thing I have done besides the usual oil changes and tire rotation is purchased tires | It has been better then I could have hoped for | Like most people I shopped around and was saying to myself Are you sure you want a Hyundai | I'm pleased I took the chance | I paid 17500March of 07 | It as sun roof XM AM FM Radio CD alloy wheels automatic all the controls on the steering wheel well it's loaded for a GLS model | Any other brand with the same options was 28000 for the cheapest | I want mention brands but it was the standard companies | Way more BANG for the BUCK | 
 "words": The car has 40k on it | The car has run flawless but the gas mileage is only about 27 28 on the highway | My 2002 accord would get 32mpg | Early on I was displeased with the dealer oil changes | The oil always looked dark gray after changes | I do it myself now and it looks fine | My wife took the car in for a brake switch recall | She gets the normal hard sell on the dealer maintenance | Hyundais have very expensive 40k checks | 298-598 | The rear brakes are totally worn out at 40k | They said that was very good | I have never replaced rear pads with less than 80k | Tires needed replacing at 35k | I will not by another Hyundai | Cost to own is too expensive | I will stick with my Hondas | 
 "words": From the time I drive my sonata off the lot the air has never worked properly and when I go to the dealer to have them look at it they want to charge me Nice I bought it that way why should I have to pay | Every time I touch something it breaks | sun visor broke after 1 week | My mother-in-law has one and when it rains she was getting soaked | My check engine light came on for two days | 
 "words": I am a former car dealer and thought I would never buy a Hyundai | I absolutely love this car | Great gas mileage cold air nice performance smooth ride nice horse power and very stylish | I like it so much that I am now looking at a Genesis for my wife | She deserves it | To say the least I am impressed with the Sonata | Also it is easy to maintain and the fact that I get the performance with 87 octane is a big plus | I have driven 4500 miles and the mpg was still at 31 to 32 mpg | Great Car | 
 "words": I have had my car for 2 years and have replaced the a c in it 3 times now | It is currently in the shop for the third a c | I bought the extended warranty and it is a joke | They want to do things the cheapest way possible and dont care if it fixes the car | hence 3 a c's in 2 years | I love my car otherwise but hate these issues | 
 "words": I bought this car as it seemed to present a good value for money | I liked its V6 performance interior design and very nice exterior | Considering how hard I drive this car I'm content with its reliability so far after 23k miles | A real problem surfaced at around 20k miles when I noticed brake noise | I thought it was the wear indicator on the brake pads but as it turned out it was my rotors | Initially I got pretty upset at the dealership as they suggested rotor replacements thought they were trying to milk me but as it turned out it's a common issue with the 2007 model | Yes I too live in the New England area and see a lot of road salt | You get what you pay for car was cheap
 "words": Bouncy ride and poor quality | Rear brake pads worn to rotors at 21000 miles | Hyundai said rust caused this problem | I have never had a car with rear pads worn to rotors with 21000 miles | I bought an extended bumper to bumper warranty for 10 years 100000 miles but hope I never have to use it because I'm sure they will find some excuse not to honor it | 
 "words": My rear brakes need replaced at 21000 miles | Dealer said it was from rust on rotors and caliper pins sticking | Also they said it was because of driving in bad weather | My wife drives this car and very seldom when roads are bad | Replacing pads and resurfacing rotors at 21000 miles is ridiculous | 
 "words": The Sonata has been a great car to drive | I drive it as a second car and it has become a sort-of utility vehicle | The room in it is fantastic great for the trips to Home Depot or Lowes | The seats are somewhat uncomfortable on a long trip but the gas milage makes up a little for the comfort | I think Hyundai needs to make a change on the front seats | All in all a super car | Having owned 2 Lexus' I would consider an Azera next trip around | 
 "words": We have driven Hondas and Toyotas for years but when it came time to replace a 1993 Accord we drove the 97 Accord several Toyotas but kept going back to look at the Sonata | In the end we went for the Sonata because of the value for the dollar | Warranty options and it just feels like a secure car | Fit and finish are on par with Honda and Toyota | The 4 cylinder is more than adequate for day-to-day driving and road trips with a family of four | Our first trip on the interstate with 3k on the engine still averaged 30 mpg | Not bad for a fresh engine | The final test will be to see how it handles a winter in the upper-midwest | 
 "words": My father owns a Mercedes and owned Lincolns before that | but he's been so impressed by my Hyundai that he's going to get the Sonata | He's tired of his Mercedes being in the shop and the standard luxury features in the Sonata Ltd can hold its own with any luxury car and it has been just as reliable as my brother's Honda's and Acura | I'm sold on the brand | 
 "words": I'm not one to make rash decisions so it took many months almost 3 to finally decide on the 07 Sonata | I looked at the Big 3 Japanese competitors Accord Camry Altima and I have to tell you for the money features and warranty none of them even came close to giving me what Hyundai did at the price I paid | I have owned my car for over a month now and am so glad I made this purchase | The V6 engine is so smooth and can definitely pop your neck if you have a heavy foot | I continue to get nothing but compliments telling me what a beautiful car it is | If Hyundai continues on this pace I will definitely buy new one in a couple of years | 
 "words": I researched more than 10 cars over the last 8 months comparing gas mileage saftey features reliablity price and looks | The 2007 Hyundai Sonato won hands down over the other makes models | There is simply more car for your dollar | It is safe gets very good gas mileage for the V-6 and it's size in SW Pa | 24 miles gal it looks feels and drives like a luxury sedan | I am impressed thus far with the feel of the car it is also fun to drive | And there is lots and lots of room in this car | 
 "words": I have now owned my 07' GLS for a little over a year with zero problems | After 13500 miles it drives like the day I bought it | Great mileage I get between 28 and 31mpg on every fill up mixed driving | Hyundai's commitment to quality for an excellent price with a great warranty is almost too good to be true | Plenty of power for a 4 cylinder smooth ride and all the safety and features you need | No wonder it is a top 10 best selling car in America | 
 "words": Feels powerful and quiet on the road | 
 "words": It's no-more good for the money Hyundai I would get this car even without the rebate | The build quality and the design is amazing | It has fast yet smooth acceleration unlike other competitors | Very comfortable interior largest among other similar car's tested | I'm very happy that I made the choice to buy this car | 
 "words": Sonata is by far the best value for the money | I started out looking for everything else but a Hyundai but on a whim I test drove the Sonata | It is hard to believe that the Sonata is built by the same company that sold the Excel | The 4 cyl is a bit weak but for an everyday commuter it works well | 
 "words": I have owned both Toyota and Honda vehicles over the years but tried the Sonata this time because my co-worker got one and he likes to run cars till the wheels fall off | I told him I was thinking about a new car and he let me try his Sonata Limited | Whoah- I was surprised- it was better than what I expected from a Hyundai | The Sonata had Side curtain airbags Stability control XM radio roadside assistance and a 10 year warranty- ALL STANDARD | If you try it you | ll rethink paying more for a Toyota and Honda with far less features | For me the Sonata GLS had everything I wanted except in- dash NAV | I never had satellite radio in a car before and this XM radio rocks | 
 "words": So far the car is running great | I initially had some clanking noise when putting in drive but this has gone away now | Car is roomy and the interior does not look cheesy | The automatic air quality system is great | the trunk is roomy too | So far I am satisfied with the car | 
 "words": So far I've been happy with this car | It has a nice ride and a lot of interior room espescially in the back | The trunk is very nice as well | There are a ton of standard features | in comparison to many of the competitor cars the Sonata drives just as nicely costs a few thousand less and comes with a 100k 60k powertrain bumper to bumper warranty | The car does NOT get as good gas mileage as the sticker would indicate | I drive on the highway about 85 of the time and tend to get around 26 miles to the gallon sticker read 24-33 | I expected a little more than that | 
 "words": We've been driving this vehicle for almost 10 months and have been quite happy with the ride and quality of the vehicle | I traded up from a 2005 Elantra for the simple reason that I needed a larger door opening due to recent knee replacement and mobility problems | The car is comfortable and quiet especially compared to my daughter's 2005 Camry which I consider a comparable car | I think I purchased the safest most quiet riding and best performing vehicle I could find in the price range give or take 3- 4K | I would definetly buy another or possibly the Sonata Hybrid when it becomes available | My only problem was with a dealer installed remote starting system that has to be reprogrammed | 
 "words": Nice car for the price but still a lot of space to improve on design aspect without real additional cost e | g | suspension | Engine is nice and powerful but not as quiet and fuel efficient as competition | Brakes are excellent but no way in comparing handling or refinements of this car with BMW 5-seires as advertised | I believe it has better value for money than 3 | 3L Azeras | You are not really upgraded with a Toyota or Honda | Next step is a BMW Luxus or Mercedes | Engine noise when you look at it at ilde with hood open seems more than one expects from such a beautiful piece of engineering | Can't feel the difference Solar Glass is supposed to make | Functional but not beautiful dashboard | 
 "words": even if the sonata where the price of the ford i would pick it any way | as far as beung advance ford is not far ahead at all | and thay have ben around a lot longer | and i just traded my 04 maxima for the 07 sonata and for some reason i think the sonata is a lot more fun
 "words": Almost 12 months oldnot back to dealer except for oil changes | 
 "words": The fit and finish of this vehicle is every bit as good as its Japanese competitors | Hyundai makes great vehicles at an affordable price | This car is reliable fun to drive and an amazing bargain | The 4-cylinder is a nice engine with good horsepower | Safety and standard features are the best in the business | 
 "words": I have nothing but praise for this car | Despite it being a 2 | 4L it drives close to a V6 with great pickup and acceleration which is great with today's gas prices | It is well built comfortable looks good and has many interior features for which one usually has to pay extra | Also important to me is good peripheral vision and the roominess it provides which is one of the biggest reasons I traded in my 2004 Honda Accord coupe with only 9K | I am very glad I did | That is one sweet driving car | 
 "words": I'm in love with my new 2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited Platinum Edition | The value I got for this car is amazing | I paid 23 | 3 including taxes and fees | I was in the market for a Toyota Camry but I saved about 5000 going with the Hyundai | Toyota wouldn't offer much on my trade in Hyundai did | And I got a V6 in addition to leather heated seats and a great warranty for the same price as the Camry SE with the sunroof spoiler packagethat was my first choice | 
 "words": I put 2500 miles in the first month of owning this car | I love this car | It handles very well has the power when you need it | Great on gas who can beat the 10yr 100000 mile warranty | Great sound system | Give it a test driveyou won't be sorry | 
 "words": After recommending a 2006 Sonata to my father-in-law last year he purchased a GLS instead of a Civic or Accord | He loves his Sonata and averages 23 mpg in town | I just traded my 2004 Envoy SLT XL for a new 2007 Sonata Limited with XM | It rides very smooth is very quiet and gets very good gas mileage | I really got a super deal from Hyundai of Decatur | I paid less than 19000 for my 2007 Sonata Limited | I got over 5000 off of the sticker and they are one of the easiest dealers that I have ever dealt with | 
 "words": Just bought my 2007 Sonata SE and so far am very pleased | My family likes the space and comfort | I went for the 6cyl and am glad | So far the gas mileage is showing about 25mpg in mixed driving which is very good | Mine was one of the last 07 Sonatas on the lot and the dealership gave me a great deal I've never had a more painless experience and I've bought a lot of cars | 
 "words": I was shopping for a replacement for a '98 Accord EX V6 and read Edmunds review of the Sonata shootout with the Accord and Camry so decided to check this out | I had been aware of Hyundai's dismal reviews for earlier models and was very surprised after a drive in the Sonata | The handling of the car is composed and feels secure for family driving I drive an '03 Infiniti G35 coupe so I can't call it sporty power is more than adequate better than the Honda and quietness of ride at 75 mph is better than the mentioned Accord or Infiniti | Fit and finish easily match the Accord | MPG thus far with 3000 miles 20 city 27 highway | Thus far I'm very impressed with the Sonata SE | 
 "words": I purchased my Sonata 2007 SE v6 about 23 months ago | It's deep blue | So far I'm HAPPY with my money | It looks great performance is great | I love everything about this car except gas mileage | I'm getting around 20 mpg over all | Besides that no problem | 
 "words": This is a great car comparable to upscale toyota camry or honda accord but about 10K less | My model is the limited nicely appointed in leather etc | Has advanced features very peppy 3 | 3 246 HP litre engine and in fact is a large car compared to its class has great legroom and trunk space | Sound system is Infinity 6 CD changer premium speakers etc | Have 2000 miles on it now gets a true 25 MPG combined city and highway | It is a great value compared to vehicles in this segment costing thousands more | 
 "words": This car looks good and runs great | Very spacious and well worth the money | I would recommend this car to anyone | I have a honda accord and paid 5000 | 00 more than the Sonata | I find the sonata drives smoother than the honda | I never thought I would want a Hyundai but I must say the Sonata changed my mind | 
 "words": I must say that Hyundai really did it with this one | I needed a reliable car that was comfortable and classy and the sonata was a natural choice | The car has been treating me well 
 "words": I had a 96 Honda Accord and was totalled in an accident | I've been eyeing on Hyundai Sonata ever since this new designed Sonata came out | After considering its style lots of standard features best warranty price | I decided to buy this Sonata | And I am loving it more than ever after owning it | Car has so many safety features like front side knee airbags Traction control Electronic stablity control ABS etc | Engine is real strong yet quiet but very fuel efficient | Ride is very comfortable and nice too | 
 "words": So far I am very satisfied | It looks great in silver blue with grey int | I can't think of anything it doesn't do well | Fuel mileage is just OK but should improve with time | And the light interior color will take a little more care to keep clean | With the warranty and MANY more safety features than the competition I feel good about my purchase | 
 "words": I don't like my new Sonata Limited Platinum What a huge mistake | The main problem I have with the car is the outrageously over-sensative electronic throttle | After 3 weeks of driving it I have a horrible ache in my foot because I'm always holding it in a wierd position up off the throttle | I'm unable to rest my foot on the throttle at all there is no swivel arm action either the gas pedal is just a hunk of plastic | The vehicle is also VERY slow to upshift on full acceleration | I've had to adjust my driving to allow for a second or two before the car actually takes off however when it finally does decide to go it really get's up and goes | it is fast and safe I will give it that | 
 "words": This has proved to be an excellent car excellent build quality tight and quiet with plenty of power and good fuel economy 24 mpg | The only negative comment I have relates to the radio controls on the steering wheel | There is a control called mode which changes the radio from AM to FM to CD but ther is no control to move between stations | A small thing but annoying | 
 "words": 1 month into a 24 lease on a bare bones Sonata GLS | Only extras mine came with are carpeted floormats | That's fine b c my lease payment is peanuts | This car is surprisingly powerful for a 4cyl | It's decent off the line but on the highway it's really superb | It's cruises at 80 effortlessly with more power to spare | I've only got 1300 miles on it but my mileage has been around 24mpg overall but I floor it most of the time | Comfort is decent | Car drives very well has good road manners and feels well composed | Car certainly isn't flashy but I like it's clean looks and I really enjoy driving it regardless | For the money I think the Sonata is unbeatable | 
 "words": This is not your 80 | s Hyundai any more | It may take some time for this manufacturer to recover from prejudiced assumption that Hyundai cars are | Casio | of automotive industry but those people who had a chance to drive recent models and then check specs and workmanship should know better already | The price is reasonable by comparison warranty is excellent quality of drive and comfort is a pleasant surprise and gas mileage is real nice | After buying mid-grade Honda and Toyota for many years almost religiously and since in last 2 years I did not like what I see so I started turning towards Nissan yet it appears that I just discovered Hyundai to be very interesting and quite logical choice | 
 "words": This is a very good car for the money that you pay | I love everything except that i am noticing a lot of squeaky noise from multiple areas inside | This is very annoying to me | But i think it will be difficult to convince dealer to fix it | 
 "words": I traded in a CX7 for a 07 Sonata SE and me and my wife love it | It is so quite inside and drives really smooth | With all of the safety features included this is tough to beat for the price | The 3 | 3 v6 has all the power you could ever want in a family car and has decent gas mileage as well | We are getting around 22 city and 28-31 Highway | Overall I would recommend this car | 
 "words": I have been driving a 1988 BMW 735i since 1988 | Also own 1987 Toyota Supra wife drives Cadillac CTS sometimes I get to drive | The last American brand car I owned was a 1986 Mercury Capri with 5 litre V8 | I do not buy or drive ordinary cars | The car is made in my home state of Alabama in the worlds most advanced assembly plant | I was sold on the car immediately after a test drive | I tried out most of it's competition Hyundai beat them all | If it was a rear wheel drive it would be a world class car | If and when Hyundai assembles a rear wheel drive in the Montgomery Alabama factory I will trade in my front wheel drive Sonata | Best buy on the market | Price was reasonable | 
 "words": My choices were not too many | Camry I4 and Sonata V6 about same price but feature-wise Hyundai was far ahead | The car is not my ideal of course as I am more tuned to European styles and this one is mde for Americans | If with replacing shock ansorbers I could acheive a stiffer suspension I would have done so but I am not sure where to find this | Maybe in Hyundai Germany | Otherwise everything else is just about Perfect | Maybe too early to say as I am drivingthis only for 2 weeks and sill in break in period till 2000km | Seats are comfortable Audio system excellent very silent indeed in idling you need to look at RPM to see if engine is running | I'll update this in 2-3 months
 "words":  I traded a 2002 Elentra for the Sonata | I had 160000 miles on the Elentra and never had any issues with the car | So my natural choice was Hyundai and I wanted to upgrade | I commute 125 miles a day and after a month I am averaging 32 MPG in mixed city hiway driving | With a commute of so much distance comfort is important and the Sonata is very comfortable and I am 6'2 | I was worried about the cost of my insurance going up but with all of the standard safety features my cost actually dropped by almost 150 a year from the Elantra | The bottom line is buy a Hyundai Sonata you won't be sorry | Great gas mileage comfortable and it turns heads | I may buy Hyundai's forever | 
 "words": It offers a lot more than what I expected | It drives really smooth and quite and spacious room front and back gives less tried for a long trip and everyday track with my kids or friends | I usually paying 28 | 5mpg an average but I've got once for 30 | 8mpg it's a awesome mpg for the size of the car | Wonderful design of interior and exterior it look as much as sharp enough and storng | It has a great acceleration on highway one of my friends says it drives better than Lexus ES330 | I like the stereo sound system it's dynamic sound | Sonata got 1 crash test from NHSTA too | I totally satisfied with this Sonata and truly truly recommand to everyone | 
 "words": I put a lot of hiway miles on my Hyundai Sonata 150-200 mi day and I must say for it's size it's very comfortable miliage is about 30-31 at hiway speed with air on but it only has 3700 miles on it not really broken in yet | Sound system is great car is exceptionally quite except road noise which is a minimum considering | The trunk is suprisingly large and the back seat is roomy and comfortable | Some friends have a 05' model and theirs is what sold me on the care | So faryes I would buy another | 
 "words": Well I have owned my Sonata gls 4cyl auto with sports package for two months now | I had shopped cars in this class from all of the manufacturers | I can say I am very pleased with the car | I haven't found a single defect that makes me want to return to the dealership for a fix | They did a fine job of manufacturing in Alabama | So far the fuel economy has averaged city hwy at 23 mpg and there are a lot of hills around here | The 4cyl has demonstrated plenty of power when entering the beltway from a ramp or when climbing hills around town | Hyundai resale values will be climbing higher with this kind of craftmanship | A strong buy from me on a great car | 
 "words":  I traded in a 2006 Chevy Uplander Minivan as the gas mileage was horrible | I checked out the Camry Impala and others and nothing compared to the value of the Sonata | I had to get a car that would allow three Child seats in the rear seat | The seats fit fine as the vehicle is classified as a large car it has plenty of room inside | The vehicle rides smoothly and the 4 cylinder has provided plenty of power | I also have the premium package and the floor mats | I would say that this is the best car in its class for themoney and possibly not even considering the cost | The five year warranty also puts the vehicle at the head of its class | I would recomend this car and the dealership to everyone | 
 "words": well we just got our new car about 3 weeks ago and i could not have asked for a better vehicle | i have had two other vehicles in the past and this car rocks compared to the other ones | it has a huge trunk roomy inside | 
 "words": This is a very nice car | It moves very well | It sits comfortably | Power when you need it and a nice growl on acceleration | Quiet with great Infinity music setup inside | Major problem I was hit by a Saturn turning right from a left turn lane in front of me at an intersection | The driver's front headlight area took the hit | The bumper popped loose the fender was pushed back against the tire and driver's door which wouldn't open and the hood was bent beyond repair | Normal fender bender speed of less than 20mph | normal repair cost 2500 | this one 5000 | Now the worst part Depreciation in 8 months and 8500 miles was 54 | Even Without an accident Hyundai said it would be the same | 
 "words": I had driven most of the sedans in this class before I was exhausted with inequities in the american car market | The Hyundai is by far the best deal on the road | Bigger than the Altima Accordand Camry all foreign but better than the Malibu or the Ford Fusion | Handles the best of all that I drove | Only Nissan was close to the ride but for the money you will not beat it | The one I bought is the SE model fully loaded with sunroofv-6 all electric seats and windows cruise tiltwith alarm | All for 21900 | Five star crash rating which is the best on the marketand that is what makes this much improved HYUNDAI a key player and the KING OF THE ROAD
 "words": We looked tested many different cars | Serious about a Camry when we tested this one | Great car for the money | We have not gotten the promised MPG though and that is disappointing | We purchased for fuel economy | Our larger heavier Buick LeSabre V6 gets as good of mileage as the Sonata and it is loaded to the gills | 
 "words": Favorite Features
 "words":  I test drove Camry Accord Galant and Sonata | In terms of performance and comfort I think there is no significant difference among these competitors | Sonata however is 5000 less than the comparably equipped Accord Camry and 3000 cheaper than Mitsubishi Galant | According to JDPower and Consumers Report in terms of overall quality and reliability Hyundai cars rank third or fourth just behind Toyota and Honda but ahead of Nissen Mazda Mitsubishi and other second-rated Japanese cars | Knowing that the quality of Hyundai cars has improved tremendously in recent years I wanted to give the benefit of doubt to the Korean underdog just as I extended the same to Toyota 25 years | 
 "words": The Hyundai engineering department needs to pay more attention to the drive train to truly make this an outstanding car | The interior exterior suspension and handling are all fine on my 2007 Sonata | The engine and transmission is where this car falls on it's face | The transmission shifts entirely to lazy and slips with the engine revving in to the next gear this shows lack of refinement | The drive by wire system allows the engine to rev slightly while coming to a stop and then rev slightly again when lifting your foot off the brake very annoying to drive with this revving | I am putting up with these problems for now and trying to get used them as the dealer say's it's normal | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Sonata | It is fun and exhilarating to drive | Performance is definitely there comfort is top notch and the features are second to none for the price that you pay for this wonderful machine | Not too mention it is the best looking sedan on the road today | If you are thinking about the Sonata and comparing it to other sedans then stop and buy right now because no other sedan even compares | 
 "words": Very nice ride quick quiet comfy | MPG could be better but might improve with more miles | Light grey interior looks great but is hard to keep clean | No problems at 3000 miles | Many safety features and standard features that are options on other makes plus the warranty sold me on this car | I also think it looks better than the competition | I just hope gas mileage improves to EPA ratings especially with fuel prices going sky-high | 
 "words": Really nice ride quiet quick comfy | Seems to me a better value than all the others | Many standard features with many of them safety features the insurance institute really likes | I hope it's as good as it's warranty | 
 "words": Toyota and Honda move over there is a new sheriff in town | Love it | great price and as the commercial says more interior space than a BMW 5 Series great warranty and outstanding ride | I am very pleased and highly recommend the Sonta | 
 "words": Excellent vehicle plenty of power tons of space fun to drive and it looks good too | 
 "words": For business I rented several of the competing mid-sized vheicles that were available from Hertz Avis and National | I put them all through some rigous perfomance testing with the idea of purchasing the best | The Sonata was the clear winner | A great bonus was that the Sonata was also cheapest car with the best warranty | Money is tight so spend it wisely and buy the Sonata | 
 "words": The car is clearly not under-powered by any means in fact the V6 is quite fast | The styling and the comfort of the car are amazing | This car stacks up VERY favorably versus the Camry and Accord | Hyundai has truly become a quality auto manufacturer | 
 "words": I am a bit mystified by the disappointing mileage achieved by the in-house reviewer | I have taken three road trips in exess of 2000 mi | in my Sonata each with two adults and luggage sometime golf clubs too | The worst overall mileage I've gotten on these trips which includes city driving idling in parking lots one hour delays on the interstate for accidents etc | is 28 | 7 mpg and the worst was 31 | 4 | I don't think the onboard computer would lie to me | In everyday driving it never has gone below 25 mpg | Anyway the V6 is really powerful it corners like a bat stops on a dime is roomy comfortable and has never had a single thing go wrong | what more could you ask for | 
 "words": All I can say is this thing is freakin awesome | I have been looking for 10 months and have test drove everything under the sun | Car handle better than the Maxima and Altima I drove | Looks better than the Camry I looked at | Out performed the Accord | Blew the doors of of Sebring and was better built that the Fusion or Milan | All I can say is the Sonata is awesome and Hyundai has come a long way | 
 "words": We are very happy with our Sonata having put 25000 miles on it in the last 7 months | It's very comfortable to drivethe engine has plenty of power the fuel economy is great | We have had 3 problems with it 2 have been self induced that have been handled quickly by our dealers service department | 
 "words": It doesn't feel like a 4 cylinder | It's very peppy | I love the interior | Very luxurious feel to it | The trunk space is incredible and the options it came with was unbeatable | Feel very secure with the excellent warranty too | 
 "words": Let me start by saying that I researched and test drove about every car under 23K prior to picking the Sonata | In doing my research I made price the least important so I could be sure that I got the car I wanted without price being the driving force for my decision | I needed a car that I could put 3 kids in sometimes but got good gas mileage since I travel a lot | I found that the Sonata had more interior room in every aspect and trunk space than any other car in its class and got comparable mpg | The build quality is easily equal to that of its Japanese rivals | I was going to buy the V6 but opted for the 4 banger | It has tons of torque and adequate acceleration | Best car I've ever had | 
 "words": I looked at the Accord and test drove it and then looked at the Sonata and the choice was easy to me Hyundai was a no brainer buy for me hands down got the Platinum edition and you just can't beat the price |
