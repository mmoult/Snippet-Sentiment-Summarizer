 "words": I rented a 2007 Kia Spectra EX and a 2007 Ford Fusion for two weeks each before deciding to purchase a Kia | The Kia interior is ultra modern while the Fusion is dated and cumbersome | As a musician I was impressed by the Fusion's great sound system that's about all | I upgraded the sound system of my Kia and now my car is almost perfect | The car handles beautifully and the transmission is excellent | My Kia is fun to drive and I look forward to each trip whether short or long |

 "words": This was my first Kia I had known a lot about Kia before and was waiting for the lease on the current vehicle at the time to run out | When it did I went straight to the dealership | It was February and it was COLD Michigan so I took the red EX on the showroom floor with a spoiler | It was an '06 model | It was a great car loved the gas mileage and very comfy | Handled the snowy icy roads surprisingly well got many good looks | Couldn't believe the power for a 4 cyl | Took it to Florida a year later 3000 mile round trip and drove mostly 90 all the way there and back the spedometer doesn't lie it goes 140 | It was very solid very little wind noise | Faster you go the less wind noise | 
 "words": I did a thorough search when looking for a new car Mazda Ford Hyundai Toyota and decided on a Kia Spectra | This car came standard with everything I needed | Some options like air and six airbags came at extra price on the other cars I looked at | I was amazed at how quiet the ride was and what a zippy little car it is | So far in mixed driving I have been averaging 32 mpg | The sound system is fine and the car hugs the road even in a heavy downpour | This car came with 4 wheel disc brakes that work so well I think anti-lock brakes would be overkill | 
 "words": Although this may be considered a practical car it's still fun to drive | The vehicle is as composed at 90 mph as it is at 55 mph | The radio and climate controls are large and easily laid out | Noise isolation and a weak engine are the cars only real vices | Engine and road noise will have you speaking louder or turning up the radio a few notches | Off the line acceleration is feeble at best |
