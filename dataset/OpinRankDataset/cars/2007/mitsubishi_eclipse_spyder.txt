 "words": I bought my Spyder back in July and have loved it ever since | I live in the mountains and on the days I can't be on my motorcycle this substitutes pretty well | The only draw back is my wife slid into a curb at 15 miles an hour on ice and let's just say that was on 12 01 and I might see it again next year | 
 "words": Everything about this car is a joy | I am proud of the looks the quality and the comfort | 
 "words": I have owned three convertibles prior to this one and it is by far the best value and hottest looking one I have owned | It is gorgeous fun-to-drive and and very spacious inside | The top stowage system is superb and works flawlessly | The brakes are great | However I am not happy that this is such a heavy car with the same horsepower as a Pontiac Solstice which is half as big | What gives | My engine should have another 100 horsepower to really move | All-in-all there is no other car to compare at this price | I drove the Miata Solstice BMW Z4 300Z and none have the roomy interior killer sound system awesome top and drool appeal |

 "words": When looking for a new vehicle I wanted a convertible with front-wheel drive that fit my golf clubs for a reasonable price | This car fits all four criteria | My son always saidDad get a fun car | Well that's what I got | This car is just a joy to drive-comfortable quiet and great sound system with fingertip controls | Personally my complaint is that now when I need a car to fit four I don't have one | The complaint about the car itself though is the blind spot | It IS difficult to see out the back and side of this car-no doubt | But my criteria was met and if I concern myself with just that then I made a great choice | I get about 18 mpg locally and 27 highway | And don't forget it takes premium gas | I get nothing but oohs and ahhs with this car and I love it | 
 "words": I've owned my Spyder for two weeks and I'm in love | I find it hard to keep my hands off her leather-wrapped steering wheel | This car is very fun to drive with very responsive steering amazing acceleration for a 4-cyl | a satin smooth suspension and a stereo system so AWESOME that my friend described it as wearing top quality headphones | With the top down wind noise is no problem for the stereo system | Can anyone find the 9- speakers | I've only found 7 of the 9 | Everyone teases me about the basically unusable back seats but I call it the dedicated sub-woofer space | Everybody thinks this car cost twice what it cost me in other words this convertible is a fantastic value too | I'm lovin' It | 
 "words": This is my second Spyder I currently have a 1999 Red Convertable Spyder which is still in excellent condition and still gets the looks | We saw the 2007 and needed a second updated Spyder | They both sit in my driveway and I always get comments about the two | The 2007 is much larger and they look cute together | My husband now drives the 1999 and I drive the 2007 | He has to ask me to switch every so often | I told him I get enough stares as it is but with this car it is amazing how many comments I get about me and the car | Ladies this is a great pickup car if your interested | I love the quick takeoff and the sporttronics is fantastic | 
 "words": We test drove the 350Z | It had no interior room | Then we tried the Soltice | Nope it needs a bigger engine | The Mustang nice but it uses old technology and gets poor gas mileage | The Mini Cooper is to yuppy | The Honda 2000 is a faster Miata but it is too small The Mazda RX-8 is very unconfortable | Its arm rest is too high it has a quirky engine and the air didn't work very well | The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas | The Corvette is too common | At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider | It is a fun sporty car that my wife and I love | It's our weekend cruiser | It's fast comfortable sporty and I love how the top is buried | 
 "words": I bought my '07 Eclipse Spyder in June and it was great until the first incident in September | One rear Bridgstone tire separated the tread at 2400 miles | Had it been on the front I would have been injured | This also damaged the rim | I went back to the dealer who stated not our problem it's not covered under the warranty | They directed me to Bridgestone who did me a favor by replacing the tire | No one wants to cover the damaged rim due to Mitsubishi putting defective tires on their new car | After only 2400 miles I think the dealer could have been more receptive to this dangerous condition | I still love the vehicle but don't trust my life to the tires | I'll use my own money to replace all four tires now | 
 "words": This car is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well | I get stopped by neighbors every day telling me how nice my car is | The car drives very smoothly | As far as the power goes I stepped into this car from owning a V8 truck and with the manual transmission and I don't feel the difference except for in my wallet at the gas pump | I love my 2007 Mitsubishi Spyder | 
 "words": My wife has always said she loved spyders and pushed me to get one until I finally gave up | I was driving by when I saw the 2007 Eclipse and decided to stop | I fell in love with this car as soon as I sat in it | I took it home to the wife and she was in complete shock that I broke down and got it | Riding around town with the top down is just great and this car will turn heads | 
 "words": I was looking for a convertable and was interested in the Saturn Sky since I was not able to get one of those I started looking at other cars | I happened to test drive the '07 Eclipse day while looking at options and I fell in love | This car is awesome | I have gotten more looks in this car and the way it rides is unbelievable | I would highly recommend getting this car to anyone who want a 4 seat convertable | I have kids so that is also what helped me decide | 
 "words": Even the 2 | 4L four cyl | is fun but the power band does not even start untill 3500 RPM | This car gets great gas milage which is the only reason not to get the 3 | 6L | Maybe a cold air intake and a new chip will wake up the engine | It also has a lot of torque steer | 
 "words": I looked at several convertibles before going with the Spyder | At the end it the Spyder vs | the MINI S | The tonneau top superior AC and vastly more comfortable seats gave the nod to the Spyder | The MINI S although a quicker and tighter ride was left to someone else willing to pay a hefty premium | The GT has plenty of power although it does not really kick in until the RPMs hit 4000 | Because of this I prefer that the TAC is on the left where I can see it | This comes in handy when playing with the Sportronic AT whilst driving with the top down and Rockford system UP | Go leather and get the heated seats | My dealer loaned me a cloth overnight and the heat was sorely missed | 
 "words": I have only had my '07 Eclipse for a little over a month | But so far | WOW | The design is nice | The back end looks great | The front end could use a little spicing up | The inteior design is nothing short of great | The sound system is dynamic | The top is easy to open and close and the it tucks away semlessly | The 4-cylinder leaves a little to be desired on power in takeoffs BUT | again I bought it for fuel economy | So the trade off is OK | The bottom line is as a motorcycle rider this is just as much fun and I don't have to put my feet down at a stop sign | 
 "words": I purchased the new Eclipse after looking at several other choices in the convertible area namely the 350Z and the Solara | After test-driving the three cars I chose the Eclipse mainly because the bang for the buck factor | The Solara was just as expensive but bland slow and ugly | The Z was great but too much money it was a tough choice between the two | The eclipse has tons of power and torque a great sound system and IMO unique but great styling | 
 "words": This is my third Eclipse Spyder | I had an '01 and '03 and by far this is the best one ever | From the inside to the out I am in love with the new style | At 48 years old I feel like a school kid again | And the comments that I'm getting on this car are remarkable | It is more soild than the past Spyders and it is great to drive | This car is a keeper in my book | 
 "words": I hated the Eclipse Spyder from 2000-2005 I had a 1999 one that I loved but traded it in when my son was born | I saw the 2007 and drooled when I test drove it | I can't stop driving it and I live in Vegas so I have the top down a lot | With all my driving I'm spending too much money on gas | The stereo system is awesome and I love the blue back lit dashboard at night | 
 "words": The Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder GT Convertible is fast reliable and most of all FUN | It handles well and has a great look | It's a very smooth comfortable ride | It is definitely worth the reasonable investment | 
 "words": I must say I may be biased as it took one 10 minute test drive to win my heart | Acually to be fair I think I fell in love with this car from the moment I first laid eyes on it's sleek lines and daunting 18 wheels | Driving the car just renewed my faith in the ability of an attainable car bringing a smile to my face on all levels | From the well built interior to the formidable performace this car will not disappoint | 
 "words": So far so good This is my second Eclipse Spyder from Mitsubishi | It has a nice appearance | I get compliments from all who see it even strangers in parking lots | Hopefully the interior will hold up better then the '01 model | I wasn't going to buy anoher one I waited over a year for the new Pontiac G6 convertible | what a disappointment | I left the Pontiac dealer and drove back to Mitsubishi | I went down to a 4-cyl | from the V6 I was used to driving but the power was great | The V6 felt great | This car does not have a lot of people room but it has plenty of shopping room | It has very sensitive controls | I am glad they got rid of the Infinity sound system | Overall I give this car a 9 | 5 | 
 "words": The all new 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse is fun to drive | I like the new sound system | 
 "words": The 2007 Eclipse Spyder is fun to drive | Yes it's not a pure sports car at the same time it is more functional for everyday use more than the pure sports car | 
 "words": After looking at many others we love this vehicle | It is appropriately powered allowing its acceleration to be smooth and consistent while the handling is precise and effortless all adding up to an outstanding driving experience | Its updated styling inside and out appeals to all age groups including this 50ish couple who love to drive lots of different vehicles | Its gas mileage is good even considering the need to use premium fuel | I appreciate the attention to detail and ease of maintenance | 
 "words": Heads are turning as my new 2007 Mitsubishi GT Eclipse Sypder rolls down the road | This new model year vehicle seems to draw a lot of interest from the public and with good reason the car is very attractive | I purchased the GT 6-speed manual and have thoroughly enjoyed the power and smooth shifting-ability | It has a nice growl to it as well | This car makes sense for all convertible seekers but value may be the key | While the back seat is smaller one can easily fit two small kids comfortably two small ladies for a drive around town or extra luggage on a trip | The trunk will fit two golf mini bags | Excellent | finally the stereo It rocks | Grab some music flip the top and drive | 
 "words": I traded in my 6-speed auto 2006 Corvette Coupe for the 6-speed manual Eclipse Spyder GT | I found the car much more responsive and easier to live with on a daily basis and I've owned numerous sports cars including 3 Vettes | After only 200 miles the care gets 21 MPG in city driving | It is a real sleeper | and great has quality for the price | 
 "words": I purchased my 2007 Eclipse Spyder just 10 days ago and I'm still in love | It's so much fun to drive turns corners really well and I love driving a 5 speed | My only complaint is that the A C knobs and temperature dial are not available to the passenger if the driver is shifting | The stereo is also amazing | Putting the top up down is not only easy but fun | I don't drive very many miles to from work however it appears that I'm getting pretty good gas mileage | In a few months I'll write another review once the honeymoon is over | 
 "words": This is my second Eclipse Spyder | I bought a new 2001 in 2000 | I had to get another one | Mitsubishi has made many improvements | The new one is longer wider and taller | It rides great | If you can afford it stretch and get the GT | The top is great | I have gotten many comments on it | It handles great rides great and looks great | It comes with many standard features | 
 "words": The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder is a very nice car | It's one of the nicest cars I have owned | I have been told by some people that I work with that the car is for girls but no way in heck | The only way I would say that it is a female car if it is painted a color like purple or pink |
