 "words": Ridiculous good looks attract a crowd everywhere I go | Flip off the traction control and make Corvette-like tire smoke | Enduraflex panels make parking lots non-scary | The Eco-Tech Turbo motor is impressive and pulls hard at virtually all RPMs | Very neutral handling posture especially at the limits impressive brakes | In the final analysis think of this car as a 7 8-scale Corvette | It's sexy overt a little louder and ready to eat GT Mustangs at the next stoplight | Despite the bravado it is civil enough my wife can drive it and enjoy the car's appeal | Would like to see a few more exterior visual cues to differentiate the GXP from the normally aspirated model | 
 "words": I just want to drive this car all of the time | Sadly I will store it for the long Michigan winter soon | I have owned quite a few sports cars and this one takes the cake | This is a roadster in the purist form of the word | I do not care if the top takes me 2 minutes to put up or down | I don't care that it has little storage or some of the swithes are a little hard to get to | I understand and appreciate the car for what it is | And quite frankly I feel Pontiac and GM nailed it with the GXP | I have owned a BMW M-3 and I think the cars manual 5 speed transmissions feel the same | I wonder if the writers for car mags just don't like to admit GM did it better than anyone else | I love this car |

 "words": I have had this car for a good month | Is way too much fun to drive and I am getting 24 | 0 miles per gallon city 5 speed manual | I usually get 3 or 4 questions comments a day on the car especially with the top down | I would do nothing but recommend the Solstice GXP | 
 "words": I own the car and I really enjoy it | It's quick fast and strong but still averages 25 mpg in the city and 32 on the highway | I have the automatic and it's pretty darned quick itself | If you can find the GXP for MSRP or close you'll be in for a treat | It's not a great primary car due to lack of storage but it has more than enough for groceries and typical shopping | If you buy a large boxed item make sure you don't have a large passenger | it will go in their lap | As for the top | you've all heard horror stories about reviewers having a hard time | sorry but I feel they are cry babies | The top is easy to operate | it just requires you to get out of the car | Get one | Have fun | 
 "words": I've been a Nissan owner for years but I loved the look and performance offered by the Solstice | I have been very pleased with the cars handling braking and performance | I'm not happy with the lack of change holders the difficulty of viewing the speedometer and the seat controls | Also it's hard to see traffic lights or go through a drive-thru with the top up |

 "words": A stable fun to drive car with lots of good features and only a few not so good | I enjoy it much more with the top down than up due to the poor visibility with the top up | Gauges are hard to read and the seats are odd but as soon as the turbo kicks in it brings a smile to my face |

 "words": Fun to drive both with the top up and down | The interior design makes it easy to use all aspects of the electronics with minimal effort | 
 "words": The looks drew me to the Solstice but the looks reflect the racing design the wheels far out at the corners the low frame and seating the aerodynamics the huge tires and disc brakes | all components of a true race car | I have been surprised at how well it drives much better than I thought it would | Cornering is a joy | The visibility from the cockpit is a little restricted but I quickly learned how to anticipate visual angles for quick maneuvers i | e | headchecks and headtilts for mirror views | Now I feel safe except I have to do a double check for right rear corner views a good practice with any car | This doesn't feel like a well-engineered Japanese car | It's looser and wilder | 
 "words": I love my 07 Solstice it is by far the funnest and best car ever | I hear people are complaining there is no place for a cell phone | What the | I am in it to drive not to chat on the phone | Also that the cup holders are behind you is a complaint there is one on the passenger side of the consol just have to look for it | Fun car and if your biggest concerns are a place for your phone and starbucks latte maybe you should stick to an SUV | 
 "words": I had a 1990 Mazda Miata | I had a 2006 Solstice | Comparing the GXP to either of these cars is a mistake | Do not be misled this is a car built for fun and high performance | I took the 2006 on a long road trip and could not even put a duffel bag in the trunk | I had to put my clothes sans suitcase where I could shoving them into nooks and crannies everywhere | 5 cubic feet of storage space ain't much especially when divided into small segments here and there | The 2006 reminded me a lot of my Miata but I got a lot more compliments questions and stares | The 2007 however is a muscle car and a roadster | It is FAST | If only they could find a way to put a suitcase in it it would rate a 10

 "words": I picked up my standard Solstice even though the GXP has now arrived | At first drive I felt the acceleration was a little less than what I wanted but it does actually have good thrust when you need it and step on the pedal to tell it you mean business | I also owned a GTO so it is not in that league but after a few hundred miles in traffic as this is my daily commuter I am more than satisfied with the car's performance | The styling also has created a lot of whiplash around it with craning necks to see what just went by | Nice ego boost | I will keep it |
