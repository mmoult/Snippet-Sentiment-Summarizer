REVIEWS
 "words": This is my 3rd or 4th Cadillac lost count but it is surely my last one | This little STS has had one annoying problem after another | and NO MILES ON IT | This evening it has shut down completely and doesn't recognize fobs won't open the trunk or move out of PARK | Road Side Assistance sent a tow truck out to carry the car back to the dealer but the tow driver couldn't budge the car out of PARK | Thankfully we are home and have a second vehicle Toyota so we aren't stranded | Now if this was happening at a mall or anywhere on the road this incident would be more than infuriating | I would not advise anyone to buy a Cadillac | 
 "words": I inherited my like new '07 STS this year and it is a pleasure to drive | There are only a few squawks programming without the nav screen is complex and the drivers seat appears loose there's a TSB that addresses it and nitrogen-filled tires are a bit overboard | Aside from those minor criticisms the car is an excellent performing car | It's rakish looks are complemented by its terrific handling | 
 "words": I leased this car and within the first year the car was in the shop for over 30 days | It was first a recall then rattles in the trunk that took three tries to fix then a blown speaker then Homelink failures | Unbelievable | I was never offered anything for my troubles by the dealer or GM | Bottom line I traded for a 2008 335i BMW sedan and could not be happier | BMW offers so much more for the money | Imagine that a BMW more affordable and a better value than a Cadillac | The original list on the Caddy was 65000 and it wholesaled after I traded it in for 25000 and only after 13 months | 
 "words": Like most people on this forum are stating this car looks great rides great preforms great stops great etc | Mechanically this car looks and performs head and shoulders above its competition | Where the STS falls short of everyone else is in the creature comforts that make a luxury car a luxury car | GM went cheap and misses the mark on these items | Bluetooth only certified to work on phones older then 2007 | May work with newer ones but they are not 100 Bluetooth compliant | See Suggested improvements below for more | 
 "words": I leased this car almost a year ago because I could get a great lease deal and liked the styling | The engine and transmission are the best features on this car | It rides extremely well and has lots of power | The problem is in the details | The Bluetooth is a joke | Our BMW works light years better | The navigation system interface was poorly designed | It is confusing much harder to use than any other I have tried | There has already been one recall plus a loose metal piece that had to replaced in the trunk plus a non- working Homelink garage opener plus lack of good steering wheel controls | For the same price you could get a BMW that is MUCH better | 
 "words": This is the first Caddy I've ever ownedand I am truly impressed with everything about it I love the way it handles and the comfort of the ride | I am spoiled now and will always look at Cadillacs when I need to buy my next car | 
 "words": Had this STS for a month now and have to say it an awesome car | Living in the north the AWD has shown that it can handle the winters here | This car handles great and is very quiet and comfortable to drive | Seems to be built solid and the V6 has enough power to keep you intrested and still provides an average of 18 mpg | The 5 | 1 Bose stereo is the best I have ever heard in a car | 
 "words": I have only had my STS for less than a month but so far I fall in love all over again every day | I have had an H- 2 for two years which I thought was luxurious until this Cadillac | This car is easilly the favorite of anything I have or ever will have | The ride is incredibly smooth like butter I can't imagine how the V-8 STS could accelerate much faster than my V-6 because it is FAST and the overall handling is to die for | The XM radio and the OnStar are things I don't need but use often | I think the pearl white White Diamond paint was the final selling point for me as it is stunning | I bought my '07 brand new in '08 saved quite a bit doing it this way would definately reccomend | 
 "words": I picked up my 2007 STS with 5K miles about 3 weeks ago | After owning a Lexus Infiniti Mercedes and BMW I think the STS presented the most value for the car | This was my first American car in over 20 years | What an improvement in design and quality | I love the technolgy and comfort | Finally nice job
 "words": This is my first American car in over 20 years | I trade in cars every 3 years due to my business | Driven Nissan Lexus Infiniti Jaguar and Mercedes | I have to say this is STS was the best value for my money | I got a lot more than what I get with any of the others including the Certified 6- year 100K warranty as my STS was a demo with 5K miles | Finally nice job Cadillac with all the refinements technology ride etc | 
 "words": After some very expensive minor repairs and service to our Mercedes E320 My wife and I started researching alternatives | We have owned mostly German and Honda cars for many years | Except for my jewel- like '94 Vett | She thought the CTS was too edgy but was totally taken by the STS | I was a little skeptical until we took it for a test drive | It was really impressive and comfortable | The first 1000 mile trip yielded 25 mpg on regular gas | Some of the controls are a little unfriendly but well worth the time to master | Last night I started the STS from inside a restaurant which turned on the heater seat heaters during a snowstorm | The warrenty and OnStar are great | 
 "words": I have now driven this car for a sold year | The car looks great and handles well | There are some problems that you should not have with this price range | I have noises in the power stearing | The gas cover is cheap and is just spring loaded | I get less than 14 | 5 miles a gallon in the city | I do like the style and handleing | There is somthing about a caddy that has a dual exhaust that is streamlined | All n All this is not a 54000 car | This is more like a 40000 car | If you were to compare this to the Lexus or Benz in the same price range you might sway away from the Caddy but the Caddy have much better lease deals | I was able to lease this luxury car for nothing down and 599 a month | 
 "words": My search for a leftover 2007 STS V8 took some effort but it was definitely worth it | I prefer the 2007 grill to the more enhanced 2008 version clearly a matter of taste | Previous car was a 2000 E320 | I would say that the STS is in another league in terms of overall refinement | The interior is absolutely beautiful particularly in Cashmire | I have not taken the time to figure out the navigation system but all other controls are user friendly | The quality of materials is on par or superior to the Mercedes | Aside from a Corvette this is the best American car on the road today | 
 "words": This is my 2nd STS | I expected a lot of my new '07 STS and have been very pleased so far | Cars I considered before buying my STS all very nice but either too small or offered less value 1 | Acura TL and RL 2 | Lexus GS and IS 3 | Infinity M35 4 | Subaru Tribeca 5 | Audi A6 6 | Mercedes E Class 7 | BMW 5 Series 8 | Volvo S70 The '07 STS handles like a sports car with luxury feel | exacly what I was looking for | It's quick for a V6 I test drove the V6 and V8 and there was not a huge difference to justify the incremental cost | I looked at a bunch of cars and the STS in my opinion gave me by far the best bang for the buck see favorite features below Very pleased so far | 
 "words": Car is an automotive winner | She blows the doors off the Mercedes Benz E class the Infinity M35 or the 535 series BMW | in both performance and and good looks | Full featured for far less | 
 "words": I am 60 years old and a car nut | I have owned 5 BMW cars and a friend said to drive the STS | I have not owned or leased an American car for 40 years | I drove this car and fell in love with it | I received an abundance of rebates and leased this car for 36 months with only paying taxes for 420 | 00 month | GM sent me a 2000 | 00 off certificate as well | The car handles smoothly I can feel the road | The V6 is plenty powerful and I didn't lease based on the 46000 MSRP | The car is tight beautifully equipped and rides like a dream | I have OnStar my own voice activated phone etc | If GM could get people to drive this car they would buy it | Kudos to General Motors for getting their act together |

 "words": I've enjoyed owning my Cadillac STS I can sum up my experience like this reliable luxury solid head-turning quiet smooth f-a-s-t | beautiful graceful turns on a dime great stability and best of all my 6'6 husband fits comfortably | 
 "words": I just leased a 2007 Cadillac STS V6 all wheel drive | This car is a blend of performance luxury and technology | With the V6 you have enough power and all wheel drive should give me great control in the winter | This is not your Father's Cadilliac | It has a smooth ride with enough power to keep your attention | The interior is luxurious | I chose this car over the BMW 5 series E350 Benz Lexus GS and Infiniti M45 | I chose the STS because its luxury performance and lease incentives | The sticker was 52000 and I leased it for 612 a month with nothing down | This car competes with the others in its class too | When I look at the US cars most of them are not worthy to compete in this class | The STS is | This is the new Caddy | 
 "words": I've owned an Audi a BMW and a Lexus | None of those satisfy me like the STS Northstar | It has lots of power the best handling sedan I've driven PERFECT Audio by Bose great engine tone and luxurious appointments | I drive nearly 80 miles every day so comfort and fun are important to me | None of my previous luxury cars have held up well | My Corvette is still my weekend car though | I am thrilled with this car but when the time comes I'd love to get an XLR-V yeah I just need to save for 2 years -D | I suggest you stop looking after Cadillac | No BMW Audi or Lexus will compare and I have experience with them all | 
 "words": This car is 30 grand cheaper than Mercedes and absolutely runs better | You don't have a service engine light come on everyday like the German vehicles | The 6 cylinder is nailing 19 | 7 mpg combined hard driving and is extremely quick off the line and very quiet | We truly cannot believe how much we enjoy this car | Seats performance Bose Audio and Wood grain are above expectations | 
 "words": The 2007 Cadillac STS is a wonderful car | I see lots of reviews | Until retirement I was a damage appraiser | I know what's underneath and this car is just head and shoulders above the imports |
