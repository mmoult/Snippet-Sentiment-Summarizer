REVIEWS
 "words": Before I purchased this vehicle I drove the matrix and other comparable vehicles also I compared them for saftey and found that caliber was by far the best buy now that I've owned it for 3 years and have friends that have over 100000 miles with no problems I'm convinced that my next vehicle will be another caliber I like the hard quality interior it stands up much better then the soft plastic | All about the car gives it high rating in my books | and unlike the others I feel safer driving it | I'm glad I didn't listen to the so-called experts that judge a vehicle for interior trim | 
 "words": I traded in a very nice 2004 Jeep Liberty for this thing I got it out of the showroom | GOD I wish it were back in there | I've had it at the dealership for fuel smell in the car while driving | They say they can't find anything wrong with it my husbands a mechanic he says their crazy but it's under warranty so they should fix it | I've had to have it lined up because it eats tires up on the inside and I'm fixing to replace tires for the 2nd time it only has 31000 miles on it | I really wish I could trade it in but the Dodge place only offered me 9000 for it and it is in excellent shape they know the cars are junk |

 "words": At 13000 miles had to get a tire rotation | There was a noise coming from the tires and also tires seems to be out of alignment | At 16000 miles had to go back for same reason but this time they found that all 4 tires were out of alignment and the tires were cupping badly enough to warrant new tires already | Dodge refused to replace tires and Firestone refused as well since it was an alignment problem and Dodge's responsibility
 "words": The Dodge Caliber thus far has proven to be a very nice car and a solid contender in the small car bracket | The performance will not blow you away but with average mileage in the 30's one cannot expect Viper stats | The overall quality seems to be good no rattles squeeks or the like | Overall I am very pleased with the car |

 "words": I've been woefully disappointed with the MPG for my SXT | I'm light on the pedal and to date the advertised 31mpg city and 39mpg hwy have amounted to roughly 25mpg city and 31mpg hwy | Also the rear hatch appears to stick in cold weather which isn't good in Canada | With a stuck hatch one finds a hatch open light comes on thereby draining the battery | This happened to me twice |

 "words":  Planned to get another Vibe | Not when I saw this Caliber | Love all the options and at a much lower price than the Vibe | Even got heated seats | Got things you can't even get on a Vibe | So many more safety features too | Really get looks when driving it | This is not just a car for the twentysomethings | 
 "words": Now I'm a fussy car guy and this is the wife's car | I like the smooth CVT | It is a crossover so it's higher with all that that brings to handling | The car feels big on the road which is good and bad | Previous car PT Cruiser | This has a smaller engine more pep and better gas mileage what's not to like | It doesn't have as much storage or clever nooks as the Cruiser | It is very smooth around town and is great for running errands but Firestone tires are noisy can't wait to change them out | Good gas mileage | Overall funky new design | Are there better dynamics out there yes but this is crossover | Is it better than a SUV yes | Bang for the buck excellent | 
 "words": We decided to downsize from a Pacifica | Decided on the R T AWD with a few extras like the driver convenience package which we like compass outside temp etc | Even with the extras a great value | CVT takes a little getting used to but the autostick is kind of fun | We like the exterior styling with a higher stance than most cars its size | Only criticism is that the 6 disc CD changer doesn't have the MP3 mini- jack so I'll have to get an FM modulator | 
 "words": Traded in a Chevy Imapala for a fun change | Really enjoying the ride and the comments from others really positive | Miss a few of the luxury features on the Chevy but think the Caliber is delivering for me | 
 "words": I was looking for a car that was dog friendly but was disappointed with the station wagon and or hatchback look of the autos that were out there | Then along came the Dodge Caliber | Love the design or hate it it's definitely not your grandmother's car | The SXT with CVT2 is the way to go | Add what you like for me it was the aluminum wheels fog lights and speed control | The car feels and looks much larger than it really is | 
 "words": Nice driving and safe car | Lots more room than my 2004 Saturn 4-door especially for the kids in back | Drives much better too | Some recent reviews have overly criticized this car in my opinion | I got this car for less than 1000 more than a 2006 Saturn Ion would have cost me which has less safety features and was not to my liking | For the money I do not think you will find a more attractive safe or versatile vehicle out there | 
 "words": I saw the ad online did my research and knew this was the car for me | I got all the benefits of the SUV I was driving with handling and fuel economy of a car | Selection is still hard to come by at the dealerships
 "words": I have only had my car for a week so far I love it | I also have a Ram 1500 | and to me this is a mini ram | It is fun to drive and turns heads where ever we go | I hope we will have a long relationship | It has great gas mileage | 
 "words": I'm 6 ft tall and even though it looks small on the outside my first trip was for an hour with my wife and 2 kids a vaccuum cleaner 6 bags of soda and chips a case of water and all the stuff that came out of my old vehicle | Plenty of room | Power is acceptable for AWD and a 4 popper | The CVT with autostick is really neat and very smooth | Engine is very quiet | First 4 cyl I've been in that wasn't whiny | Comparing the Civic Mazda 3 Focus and Vibe this rocks for the same price features as the rest | Exterior is very different and Dodgy much better than the others IMHO | 
 "words": Even though I have had my Caliber one week I love the pick up and the smooth and quiet ride | The car certainly turns heads on the road | I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a car with spunk | 
 "words": Just traded my 2005 Jeep Wrangler X on this great little car | Makes the Jeep look like a dinosaur | They put their thinking caps on for this one | I have greatly anticipated its arrival | I have already sold a friend on getting one | My neighbor also | I get looks as if I were in an Aston Martin | Rack one up for the USA and Dodge |

 "words": The interior is very thoughtfully designed and of good quality materials thanks MB | I traded in a 2001 Volvo V70 on this and am happy with the exchange | I can't comment on reliability yet but have high hopes | I have the CVT and must point out that many people hate them thinking they're sluggish | They take an entirely different behavior to drive properly first and foremost being do NOT feather the gas | It gives decent acceleration performance once you understand its behavior | My only complaints are some wind noise above 35 and the seat is a bit high for me I'm 6'7 so anyone can fit in this |

 "words": Welp after being told I was crazy and all the clunking noises I have dumped my Caliber | It actually got good mileage it had to have something good | Frankly I was starting to fear the car was going to fly apart | The dealership service kept telling me it was the tires making the noises and I told them 'You let me drive it off the lot like this' I took it to Firestone and they said the tires were fine numerous times | Come on | If I had needed tires I reckon Firestone would have wanted to make a buck or two | Anywho I wouldn't recommend the Caliber | Too bad I thought it was going to be a pretty good car | 
 "words": This car has great acceleration and a sporty design with tons of room inside | It handles in snow and can pass like a beast | Mine has no problems and its at 65000 as of today | My only complaint is the tiny gas tank | By the time your gas light is on youve usually gone through only 11 or so gallons of gas | I feel like a kid that has to go to the bathroom every ten minutes when I'm stopping for gas every few days |

 "words": Absolutely the worst vehicle I have ever had | I leased an R T and parked it for the last month of the lease not because of high miles but this car was so noisy inside rode like a truck wore out all four OEM tires in 27k miles junked one battery had no handling at all no throttle response and poor mileage for a 2 | 4L | Other owners of the same car agreed with me and family members that had the opportunity to drive my R T could not believe how bad a car is was | 
 "words": Bought new 51 weeks ago | run 27000 miles already mostly my 50-mile daily commute down the I-5 in So | Cal each day plus three trips to Vegas and city errand kids school carpool driving etc | This is the only new car of six I've ownedthat has not had any defects or problems whatsoever | The original Firestone 18 performance tires still have plenty of service life left and surprisingly so do the original brakes | The only service has been oil changes every 5K miles 17 at the Dodge dlr not bad for OEM My 16 yr old daughter thinks this car is cool | Definitely get the R T though as added amenities bigger engine autostick and 4wheel disc brakes are crucial for the enjoyment of this car | 
 "words": This car will not make it to 100k | Electrical problems battery will go dead for no reason | Terrible acceleration due to very poor CVT | Gas mileage suffers | Because of it you need to go deeper on the gas pedal to get up to speed | In shop for numerous repairs only has 30k miles on it | In shop now because a coolant leak from the engine not the radiator or hose but a main pipe that leads to the engine has to be checked out to see if new engine is needed | Terrible blind spots | Check plastic in trunk scratches and scuffs very easy | I won't be surprised at all if people that previously reviewed the car good need to come update it | Now I see why they need a bailout this being one of the reasons | I own 97 Camry with 200k miles less problems than this car at 30k 
 "words": I'm reading the reviews here and getting nervous about the transmission | For the last several fuel fill-ups the car doesn't accelerate properly | It'll go then there's a noticeable loss of power upon acceleration then go while my RPMs are all over the place | Usually after getting gas I'll have to pull over and re-tighten the gas cap it looks like I have OCD at the pump | putting the cap on over and over until I feel like I have a good seal | This morning at 55k my check engine light came on for no reason haven't refueled in days | I'd like nothing more than to get the light to turn off and trade it in before I'm out 4k | 
 "words": I have been driving Chrysler products for many years because I find them more reliable | I chose the 2007 Dodge Caliber after I tried out Matrix and others and notice the structure was much safer looking and it had a 5 star rating and it felt more like a safer car to ride in | After reading of so many being injured and killed in Toyota and other small cars I chose the Caliber and I'm glad I did | The ride is unbelievable performance and economy better than expected | I usually trade every two years but this one's a keeper for another year or two | Compare the structure of this vehicle with Japan's vehicles and you will feel safe in a Caliber 
 "words": If you haven't owned a Big 3 car in years this car will justify that | I like the looks and the mileage is okay but this is the first car that I owned since the early 80's that would not start up on a cold morning | It finally did start after a few trys and pumping the gas | I have the feeling from reading some of the other reviews that I won't be getting I lot of years out of this car |

 "words": If you are considering this vehicle make sure that you check out all of the competition first | My main motive for purchasing this car was price as I was eligible for the employee discount | I got the 1 | 8 with manual trans because I just don't trust CVTs to hold up for the long run | After 28k miles the exterior plastic is fading the mileage is awful and it still has a problem stalling at random not driver induced it often happens in neutral | Perhaps all these problems are due to it being a first run year but either way I would be weary | 
 "words": This car is very comfortable and has a nice feeling to drive but it is extremely unsafe the visibility on this thing is the worst of any car I've ever driven | 
 "words": I am a Volvo man have owned 7 over the years still own a 1994 940 | I recently bought my first Dodge and am extremely happy with it | The reason I looked at the Caliber is I am a wheelchair user manual non-folding ultralight weight and I have found that most new cars on the market are either too small to hold my wheelchair without taking it apart are huge gas guzzlers or are too expensive for my budget | The Caliber will hold my wheelchair gets great gas mileage and is one of the least expensive new cars I have ever bought | It totally satisfies my requirements is fun to drive and the dealer service department is excellent | I highly recommend this vehicle |

 "words": After reading quite a few of these reviews the common theme is tire issues | I too have been told that my tires need to be replaced | I have been told that it could be because of my alignment suspension tire pressure you name it | It just seems odd that a lot of people seem to have this issue | Chrysler won't do anything sent me to Firestone who sent me back to the dealership | Not good | Very poor customer service | When are they going to take the hint and look into what is causing the problem |
