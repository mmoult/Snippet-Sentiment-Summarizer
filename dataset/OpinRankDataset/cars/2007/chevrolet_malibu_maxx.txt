REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased this car used from a dealership with 32k miles on it | I also own a 2005 Malibu sedan | I immediately noticed a clunking sound coming from the steering column when turning the wheel at low speeds | This is a sound I also noticed in my 2005 Malibu | I took it back to the dealer and they had to lubricate the intermediate shaft in the steering column | The shades to the sunroof also broke so they ordered new ones for me as well | The car is comfortable rides well and has good acceleration with the 3 | 5 liter V6 | I don't understand how some people here are getting 29 mpg however because I am getting about 18 mpg in mostly city driving | Disappointing mileage | 
 "words": I bought this car while I was a salesman at the dealer | Knowing the whole product line I knew the best value when I saw it | The car has been great | 33 | 9 mpg on a recent trip to Florida great in snow | Best brakes I've ever had on a car great power and economy cavernous storage space comfortable seating and great stereo | The rear roof window shades could have been designed better and there is a noise in the front end over bumps other than that no complaints I'd buy another one in a minute | I'm on the road a lot in sales and since the maxx is no longer available my next car will probably be an Impala LT with leather | 
 "words": I bought this dark red 'program car' as an ex-rental with 10000 miles on it in December '07 | A certified used LT 2007 for 16000 | Great savings off of new and I don't particularly like the looks of the 2008 | I love it so much more than the other cars I test drove new foreign sub- compacts | Quality is on par and you get so much more for your money | Styling is great | mpg decent for V6 power | comfort | utilitarian design | safety features | 
 "words": I have had my Maxx for 6 months and put 15000 miles on it due to my commute and the Maxxhas impressed me every one of those miles | The seats are comfortable the ride is smooth and quiet and most of the controls are easy to reach and read | and the sterring wheel radio controls are great | Have not been to the garage except for 2 oil changes | The rear wiper is great in the rain and snow to keep clear view out the back | 
 "words": I fell for this car when I found it in the used section of the dealership over a year ago | The XM radio the wood trim although it's fake the zippy way it drives the dvd player the two sun roofs | all so neat | But the Maxx has been plagued with problems mainly electrical | And I have been driving for 10 years with no problems with blowing out the tires but I have gone through 4 different tires on this car apparently due to my driving I was driving trucks before | I'm not sure that I would buy this car again | I think I would go for a Honda or Toyota sorry Detorit | 
 "words": Owned this car for over a year now | I had test driven the LS but the LTZ is a class above | I agreed with Edmunds bland interior for the LS but found the LTZ felt totally different | The leather wrapped steering felt much more comfortable and the rest of interior did not feel cheap | Same with the wheels etc | I never read the manual much so I keep finding new things in the car | When cleaning I found the audio volume control on the steering on the underside of other audio buttons | Recently I found out I could do tap-shift | I could not figure how to operate the buttons earlier till I put the car in L coming downhill it was so much fun | 
 "words": I replaced a 2004 Maxx with this 2007 Maxx SS | I was and am totally satisfied with the car | Finally a great eye-appealing sport sedan from GM and Chevy decides not to build this model for the 2008 Line-up | To limit production of this model to 3 years is questionable | 
 "words": The Malibu Maxx came out of no where while searching car lots oddly enough it had every feature I wanted and for a very reasonable price | Don't believe the in-dash MPG rating instead calculate it out yourself | I've found the computer is off by a large margin including waiting at a light in the MPG calculation | I average with city and highway around 26-28 MPG | Great car for a college student like myself or a family just starting out | 
 "words": After driving foreign built vehicles for the last 18 years I came across this car at 3000 below blue book and bought it | Had I bothered to check that this garbage can had depreciated 15000 in 3 years I would have passed | But alas I didn't and now I have the pleasure of fixing all the KNOWN GM design problems in the steering column brake rotors steering rack and struts | I have had 1960 era cars with better steering and suspension systems | Of course because GMC is an American company it is based on greed and not customer care | they refuse to fix recall any of these problems because not enough people have died in the car | I look forward to the day when I can unload this lemon | 
 "words": Love the car | chose it over small SUV's and have no regrets | Loads of standard elements like remote start and automatic headlights | hatchback can be reconfigured to haul about anything | Small drawback is the 20mpg mileage with the 6 cyl engine | 
 "words": First off the auto press nit-picking about the steering gruff engine and interior simply are not true | The electric steering is just fine it adjusts to vehicle speed and there is all the feedback of a hydraulic unit | I notice no difference and I have driven a lot of cars in my life | As for the engine it's just as quiet and smooth as the V6 in my mom's Lexus RX300 | The interior well on the LT it's cloth not leather but it's just as swank as my work mate's Accord LX it's workaday no doubt but for a mid-line interior it's got what the others do | This car also handles and brakes very well too | Don't let the press fool you this car is every bit the equal of it's Japanese competition | 
 "words": Very pleased and surpised about the handling and comfortable fit of the seats and placements of all of the controls | Felt like I had this car for years even though my previous car was a large rear wheel drive the Malibu took no time getting used to it | 
 "words": I drive my Maxx 120 miles a day and I enjoy it very much | It handles great is comfortable and I get 29 miles to a gallon | Has style and my coworkers really like it | Some of them have gotten themselves one also | A great unit | Wished more people would try it | They would love it like I do | 
 "words": I absolutly love this car | It is a great car for the family without taking out style | It has good gas mileage and I can always rely on it | It's a pleasant suprise | It's a plesure to drive and to look at | It can seat four to five people | It also much better than any SUV |
