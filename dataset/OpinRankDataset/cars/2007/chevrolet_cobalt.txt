REVIEWS
 "words": I hated the dealership I got this car from so for all my service I go to a different dealership but outside of the dealership the car is great | I get 27mpg city driving the get up and go is a little slow but its just a 4 cylinder so that's okay she handles turns great and handles the occasional long drive out of state | Great first car for me | Body lines are clean and the size and shape are ideal for Jersey driving and parking | Love it and would recommend this car | 
 "words": This is a good little car but I wouldn't buy one unless your in it for the long haul | If you want something that's good on gas fun to drive and cheap the Cobalt is a good choice but I wouldn't buy a GM product unless I planned on keeping it for 10 years | It's poor resale value overwhelms the cost of paying it off | Overall it's a well built car but the plastic interior is a bit cheap | Also don't slam the glove box or it will crack at the opener like mine did | 
 "words": Overall I am pleased with the fuel efficiency but little else | I started having trouble when the drivers side door broke off completely | I got online to do some research and have found that I am not the only one with this issue | I decided to repair the handle myself just to find out that it will take more than just removing the interior door panel | I switched from Ford to Chevy in hopes of easy repair work but I miss my Ford already | 
 "words": This car is very fun to drive and has a cute body but those are about the only good things I have to say about the car | In the very few months I have had the car I have had | the breaks replaced had to buy a new battery and have had the whole gear shift unit replaced | It is not practical at all | There is no space what so ever in the back seat | The inside paint scratches way too easily and the stereo razzes very easily | Over all just not a practical car | Oh and if you get one with a fin on the back forget about rear visibility | 
 "words": I've had my Cobalt for a little over a month | It's a wonderful first car | I read reviews here before buying this car | I read about someone hearing a cricket noise when the air conditioner was on I hear this noise every time I have the AC on it can get annoying after a while because I hear it over my music | I've put aver 1000 miles on it since I got it | Now it has about 42000 miles on it | It gets around 26-28 mpg in town | It's a wonderful car - I love it | 
 "words": I wanted a safe dependable car to send my daughter off to college | She liked the sporty look and we shopped until we found one with the bells and whistles | The car has 37000 miles on it so the bumper to bumper has expired barely 36000 | While she was driving from Nashville the power steering just quit working | I'm glad she wasn't in a turn | Dealership and GM are not very sympathetic but when I googled Cobalt power steering I found that this problem is widespread | I hope that anyone considering the Cobalt will use google and research this power steering failure | 
 "words": I love my Cobalt but I am worried about it's reliability | My visor broke after I had the car about a year | I have not even had the car 2 years and the top part of my shifter knob just broke off along with the plugs for the chargers no longer working | Also the emergency break went out | Great that it's still under warranty but what am I going to do after that | 
 "words": Not sure where to start | had my Cobalt for less than a month when I heard a horrible rattling noise | Took it to the dealership only to find that the windshield had been installed upside down and had to be replaced | Got the car out of the shop | Drove it for two weeks and started hearing a horrible noise in the front end | Two compressors later and I still hear a 'bug zapper' like sound when I run the heat or the air | Dealership swears that they can't hear it but everyone else who has ever been in the car has commented on it | The car drives okay but honestly has been in the shop way to often for a brand new vehicle | As the owner of both an 07 Cobalt and an 07 Malibu LS I'm unhappy w GM | 
 "words": Before I had a 2001 Chevy Cavalier that had reached 225000 miles | I thought that the Cobalt would be comparable to the Cavalier boy was I wrong | I love the style of the car very cute inside and out | The features are amazing XM MP3 jack remote start but the quality leaves much to be desired | I have had to fix so much on it in two years broken tail light after two weeks of ownership squeaky sunroof loose seat fabric breaks and rotors replacedonly after 15000 mileft control arm radio buttons stopped working and BOTH remotes to my car are broken | 
 "words": This is an update from my 9 13 07 post | This is a great little car | Fuel economy is 34 to 36 on my mostly highway commute at about 60 mph | Got 40 mpg on trip once | Seats are still comfortable | Shifting is not as crisp as when new | Never been back to dealer for any warranty service | Oil change is super easy with the front cartridge filter and oversize filler cap | Tires will need to be replaced before next winter | 
 "words": Had my Cobalt for a few months now and I'm really happy with it | My last car was a Honda and I've noticed that the Cobalt just feels more solid right down to the thunk the doors make when they close | I've crossed 32mpg on the highway and the car rides like a much bigger vehicle | Can't beat this car at the price | I think Chevy came up with a winner this time | 
 "words": I ordered this car after combing through the entire STL region looking for a blue 2 | 4 ss with sunroof and airbags | Car came and was surprided to find xm was standard | I really didnt care for it but now after listening i cant live w o it | Also FM and AM reception with antenna is poor | Gas mileage is tricky | In order to get 34 mpg you have to drive like 55 mph on the highway | At 65mph I'm already at 2 | 5 K in 5th gear could definitely use another gear for more gas saving | Overall I average 29mpg with 70 30 highway city driving | Handling is 'sport' like but it was easily be pushed over it's limits with body roll | Ride quality is very nice however very smooth | I'm looking forward to modding it
 "words": What can I say | It's a great car that GM has finally put some real effort into | For me its been 1 month since I took delivery and there hasn't been a day I didn't look forward to driving it | Moreover driving it daily has been a great experience | The fuel economy when not heavy footed hardly ever due to the rewarding power of the Eaton M62 Supercharger is comparable to that of the ultra-compact econo-gas misers | Yaris Aveo etc The factory performence packages being offered by GM's Performence Parts division are the best to be found in the aftermarket | So you get more power out of your beast while retaining full factory warranty when installed c o GM Service depts hard to argue | 
 "words": I bought this car brand new | The first week it was fine | But within the second and third week of driving strange noises started coming from the front engine area these weird ratting sounds that would come and go | And after 3 weeks a horribly loud noise suddenly started clicking | It sounded like it was coming from the right front tire | So I had to take it back to the dealership to get fixed | The brakes also make a strained sound and they aren't paticularly as sharp as I'd like them to be | The clanking sound is unnerving and extremley annoying | Now I have to go out of my way to get it fixed | This is inconvienent and not fair I've only owned for less than a month | 
 "words": This car is very well rouded | It has performance handling style fuel economy and isn't too expensive | 19500 brand new w all but 6 disc changer Power is solid up to 3500 rpm and then she just screams all the way up to redline at 6500 rpm with an auto trans The power is exhilarating | Handling is absoltutely superb while maintaining a pleasant ride even my wife doesn't complain | Fuel economy is good considering the power 175 HP | I usually get about 26 miles per gallon with a pretty even split of city and highway drivingand my pedal to the floor | I think this car is the total package | I test drove a few other competitors with comparable economy and the Cobalt SS was the obvious choice
 "words": After 3 weeks and some 1800 miles my Cobalt and I have come to know what to expect from each other | This mild mannered compact rocket is a solid commuter at about 32mpg at average highway speeds of 70-80mph | What is truly surprising is that when you need a little burst of excitement or feel the need to circumnavigate the occasional left lane obstacle a quick crack to 3rd and back to 4th makes you want to kiss your sales man for suggesting you test drive the S C | As for the responsive handling considering the base model is the offspring of the Caviler it is a blast to drive even with some mild under steer | Style is 1st rate in the sport compact class | Only one bad thing GM why no S C in 2008 | 
 "words": Purchased on Sept | 1 06 | 10000 Kms to date | This car is a blast to drive | I can barely stand to drive it slow | This car is not much of a town car but is totally a highway car | Power is more than enough for daily driving and space upfront is great | Rear seat space is excellent for a compact car | Trunk space could be a little better but again it's a compact car | My only regret is I was unable to get the G85 Recaro Package due to order date and GM product management difficulties
 "words": This is a great car for the money | I got it with a 1000 rebate so it ended up being cheaper than a similarly equipped Aveo and there's much more car here | Currently using top-tier 87 fuel and synthetic oil between town and highway driving i'm getting about 35 miles gallon | on a 13 gallon tank I can get over 400 miles and still have over a gallon of fuel left The audio input jack is a great standard feature and for those who wish to upgrade their audio on their own they'll be pleased to find the battery in the trunk | I almost bought a used ford focus for around 10K but This car after rebate taxes etc | ended up being 13K and wasn't somebody elses problem | No regrets | 
 "words": I bought my Cobalt for the rebates otherwise I'd be driving an import | That said the Cobalt is a big improvement over the outdated Cavalier | Excellent fuel economy I've seen 36mpg | and with only 2000mi it will improve when things loosen up | The metallic orange paint gets attention and the 2 | 2L Ecotec is one of GM's best engines ever | However a good engine and decent styling can't hide all the places GM cheaped out | Such as lock placement that makes them impossible to use while you're seated in the car or the solid grey interior door panels it would have been much classier to continue the dash's two tone them into the doors or the cheap feeling steering wheel and shifter | 
 "words": We got the Cobalt early May '07 and by late May I have almost 4000 miles on it already and it seems like a pretty decent car | Has some pretty good pep for a 4cyl fuel economy is great compared to the SUV we traded in for it however not the 34 mpg that they advertise still I'm getting around 27mpg | The stereo system cranks good for a stock radio and CD player | We can not fit the whole family in it leagally or safely for that matter but that's what the wife's mini-van is for | All in all I'd have to say I'd give it a thumbs up lets see what breaks on it in the first 50K or 100K miles | 
 "words": I know that the Cobalt is an upgrade from the Cavalier but it's way beyond that | The cCobalt is much more comfortable and rides much smoother | I would recommend this car to everyone | It's great for travel or just your everyday driving | Chevy is definitely a winner with this one | 
 "words": We purchased this car as a commuter for my wife really not expecting an exceptional vehicle for 13500 out the door | My feelings have changed after making several day long drives really taking a liking to the car | With 266 miles on the odometer we're getting 39 miles per gallon on the interstate really great on a car that advertised 34 MPG Hwy | Secondly it handles exceptionally well and is comfortable to drive | 95 of the time I drive a full size truck never paying attention to the fact that your constantly scrutinizing your size in a given space | it does weigh on you in commuting | This is a nice car and we're actually discssing getting another in the Pontiac version | So far elated | 
 "words": I bought my SS 2 | 4 Colbalt with 147 on it | White with black interior has everything I wanted power everything awesome stereo sunroof | This car is just the best ever for the price I paid and the competitors was prices just right and not over 20k for the options I wanted I drove the Civic Si the new Sentra Se R Tiburion even Saturn Ion Quad Coupe also the Pontia G5 the cousin of the Cobalt All these were either over priced or didn't have what I wanted to pay for | Chevy has finally got it right and I got the last White one in the area for 2007 sorry | I love it from the moment I saw it I wanted it | Love a first sight so to speak 
 "words": It is larger than you first think | The engine is terrific | The size of the whole car is just right | Big enough to carry 4 people small enough to be fuel efficient and powerful enough to not require a V6 | The stereo is a great design and a joy to work although a little more power would be nice | The paint job on my Cobalt is exceptional | I bought the paint protection | I think it is well worth the price for any car | Overall a great ride for not much money | I looked at Focus but I think the Cobalt is a better car for less money | 
 "words": I was ready for a new car and wanted to spend less than 15k | The Cobalt was a no-brainer | The 2 door laser blue coupe looks fantastic and I got it with all the goodies I wanted for under 14000 | I've owned it for a few weeks and I have only a couple of complaints | The doors are long and locking unlocking them is awkward power door locks should have been standard | No armrest whats up with that | The interior of the doors are all one color light gray | Adding a darker gray to the door would have looked sportier and hidden stains better | Window crank handle fell off in my hand after only a few uses just snapped it back on and all is well | Gas mileage seems OK a few more mpg would be nice 
 "words": This is the first new car I have ever had | Good car for the 15000 I spent after taxes | I have a middle of the road model with power windows and air conditioning | One irritating problem is that after owning the car for five months I am now hearing a sound of something loose or rolling around in the front engine tire area of the car whenever I make a moving right turn and sometimes a moving left turn | I took it to the dealer and they claimed that only one of two mechanics who looked at the car could hear the sound | They stated that did not know what was causing it and could not fix it | I don't understand since sound is obvious and I am continuing to press the issue with dealer | 
 "words": Engine has plenty of power for a 2 | 2 | So far the mileage holds true 24 city 32 hwy | Steering is effortless but tight enough to feel the road | Handling is tight through the corners and the Pirelli's hold the road even in the N | W | rain | Interior is excellent with all the comforts of the 21st century | Overall I give the car and the experiance an A | 
 "words": With 6000km behind me I can say that I'm very pleased with my purchase | The powertrain is superb and interior space provides comfort that's completely devoid of tacky gimics common to the Japanese competition | Handling is very good for a FWD car but the ride is stiff | The brakes will send your dentures through the windsheid and the gearbox has an American feel to it | Longish throw but having solid positive engagements | It's really nice actually and it feels strong | To my eye the body styling is beutiful in it's simplicity despite the wing | GM did not cheap-out with this platform | Tested at the Nurburgring it shows | 
 "words": After looking at Honda and Mazda etc | when shopping for my next ride none had the options price I was looking for without buying aftermarket items | On long drives I do not suffer from fatigue I felt in previous cars or feel in other models that I get from the rental companies | My job requires extensive travel and I find myself comparing every rental I receive to my Cobalt | The Cobalt handles very well | I get a good sense of the road when behind the wheel | Simply put my Cobalt is not going anywhere unless I am driving | 
 "words": I traded my favorite car I have ever owned a Chevy Tracker for a new Cobalt | I was afraid of switching to a small sedan | I love it | It drives great | It is nice to look at | The paint is a deep blue that the sun sometimes reflects off as purple | Getting 31 | 4 mpg city driving combined | Perfect big city car | It's a winner of a car if you don't have to have the biggest one on the road | 
 "words": The Cobalt SS supercharged is a truly great car | It's fast reliable and perfectly built | The features it comes with make it fun and its good mileage makes it cheap to fill up | Since the car is so light and it has 205 horses it can accelerate extremely fast | 
 "words": Just got the car a few weeks ago as a new daily driver to replace my '97 Sunfire | Ride is very smooth | I'll be going down the highway thinking I'm doing 65 and it's really up around 80 | Handling is nice and tight with minimal torque steer | I've been getting around 31 mpg however it's only a 13 gallon tank so it seems to go quicker than what you're averaging | Overall for the money it's hard to do better | The car is leagues ahead of the J-Bodies it replaced | Just will have to wait and see how it holds up in the long run | 
 "words": Got my Cobalt early this month and totallyl ove it | Personally I love the look of the coupe much more than the sedan | What caught my eye was its low price | Although the price had me skeptical coming from a Chevy oriented family I had to give them a shot | Car is very responsive great on sharp turns and fun to drive | Getting to know it I would have preferred an SS but I got what I can afford | My friends simply say the more you see it the more you get to like it | Speaks for itself | Great start off car for a teenager parentals | This is my second and wish I would have had anything similar to it as my first | 
 "words": I have not owned a GM in a while | I must say for the price and for a 4 cylinder car the performance is great | Handling is sharp has every feature in most dealer models the heated leather seats are great | I compared this model to a new Civic and a new Focus this had more options and is faster for about the same amount | Although I have not had it that long the build quality seems very good | Another thing to point out its made in America | My fiance also recently bought a Pontiac G6 and is also very good I would say one of the best cars they have built in a long time | GM is making some good changes thier new lineup is more reliable appeals to the market and still costs less | 
 "words": The gas mileage is great | The small car grows on you as you drive it | Fun | Easy to maneuver turning radius 33 | Decent pick up for the on ramp | Safety scores high | Gave the car to my DD and am now considering another one after shopping Mazda Honda Mitsubisi and Saturn | Can't beat the price and quality mileage and safety without all the options nickle and dimeing you to death | 
 "words": What can I say | GM did it again | This is a huge upgrade from the Cavalier | I was a big fan of the Cavalier z-24 and im a bigger fan of the Cobalt | I got the upgraded sound system with ten inch sub | Wow good job | I never had a white car but this Cobalt looked great in white | The handling is great | The all black interior is very smooth | Great on gas | I drive great distances to work and back | all i can say is wow | The car has the needed boost to get past those slow drivers with no problem | Great bang for the buck | 
 "words": It's a great car for someone looking to not spend over 20000 and still have some room and functionality | Great trunk room along with easy to function stereo driver information center and cruise control | Smooth drive with decent gas mileage in town21 mpg | expected 25-28 but lower than advertised | 
 "words": This car is so fun to drive | I used to have a Sentra Spec-v and this Cobalt SS is so much more fun | I love it
 "words": I bought my 2007 Cobalt LS coupe in September of 2006 and I love it | The performance for the money 12850 is mind blowing | The handling isn't too bad either | I can sling the passengers around and a tire never slips not so much as a squak | Refined suspension and a fairly powerful 148 hp stock engine make for one heck of a back road driving experience especially with the easy to operate 5-speed tranny | If stock isn't for you don't worry GM makes more than enough goodies for this car and if they won't do think about it this car is probably America's best compact car | Aftermarket companies are drooling right now | 
 "words": After a lifetime of fast sports cars I just totaled one ouch | Decided I'd get a bare bones econobox for cheap insurance to tide me over til the new Camaro debuts | After looking at all the others I picked the Cobalt | I love this car | Fun to drive decent power and mileage plus it looks great in Victory Red | Love the tail lights | Lowered it with Eibach SportLines bigger rims BFG T A KDW's spoiler full tint sheepskins | I'm gonna keep her as my daily driver after I get the Camaro | Highly recommended | Big bang for the buck | Chevy You won me back | 
 "words": I really enjoy my Cobalt so far but have only owned it for 1 week and haven't had a chance to take it on a long trip | I have only been getting around 20 miles per gallon in town which is a big disappointment to me because I was told this vehicle would get around 25 miles per gallon for in town driving | 
 "words": I bought my Cobalt brand new in 2005 so I'm sure by now Chevy has tuned the model up some | But overall it is a decent car | I would have tried to get rid of it but they do grow on you | The ride is good and the handling is great | You would expect fuel economy to be better from a 4-cyl | though | The worst parts about it are the interior design and room | The backseat isn't comfortable or roomy at all and the trunk opening is tight | Headlights are average and on long drives it can get uncomfortable | Worth a look though | 
 "words": This car is a whole lot of fun all around | I think it is best on roads that have a lot of curves | The ride is a lot better then I expected | 
 "words": I find the car handles well and picks up fast once you hit 3000 rpm | HP is actually a whopping 226 | Outperforms a Corvette in the slalom and is kind of sexy in appearance | Watch out for potholes because the car doesnt handle them well | I owned a '90 Z24 prior to the SS and wow what a step up | Keep up the good work GM | Look out imports and V8's | 
 "words": It seems like time stops when im in my Cobalt SS SC | It handles great and I love the interior all the options and what the factory offers for me for aftermarket | Really a lot of car for the price | Just writing this makes me want to go out to the back roads again 
 "words": This Cobalt I have is such a dependable sporty car | Wherever I go I can't help myself but to put the pedal to the metal with it | It's just awesome | 
 "words": I love this car | It is fun to drive | Handles great | Fuel mileage is pretty good too | I average 26 | 5 town hwy and 31 on the freeways | The sound system in it is awesome too | Taking corners is awesome in this car | I think with a custom sway bar it would be better | All in all I love this car | The good outweighs the not so good | The few things I don't like is the emergency brake and the middle console are on top of each other making the emergency brake difficult to access | Seems to have a bit of a lag in between some of the gears and 1st is way too short | 
 "words": This car is exciting powerful and fun to drive | It makes my communte to work enjoyable | Days off even more | I have a Mercedes CLK 430 and it rarely leaves the garage now | Performance upgrades frome GM are great and inexpensive and make a huge difference | 
 "words": We purchased this vehicle after having driven a rental vehicle of the same type for a month | We were pleased with the way the rental drove and have been equally pleased with the purchased vehicle | We havc a five on the floor tranny and it is a great deal of fun to drive | The gas mileage has been much better than we expected running over 30 MPG for most of our driving which includes city highway and rural driving | 
 "words": For the money the power build and fuel economy it is just as good if not better than any import | Kudos to GM for this vehicle | And as a former Honda BMW Mercedes owner I'm not just saying that | GM is again an entry level leader | 
 "words": Looks great | Handles very well around corners | Good size engine and a nice radio upgrade from the '06 to the '07 model | Only suggestion is to have better quality speakers | Other than that a great car for a good price |

 "words": I bought my cobalt the night after my high school graduation I bought it for 11988 with 15389 miles on it | But the night I drove it home when I hit my very well maintained gravel driveway I heard a loud thud coming from the steering | Well the dealership replaced both steering shafts but now 17000 miles later at around 31500 miles the same shaft need to be replaced | It all was under warranty but now I am worried about it going out at 4500 miles not under warranty | but over all it is a very flashy car especially with a loud exhaust | gets the cop's attention | I love the stereo and the interior design | And I am getting 26 | 5 mpg driving around town and I once pulled 35 | 6 on a road trip | 
 "words": The LS build was certainly a fun car to drive | Obviously it's not a sport so performance is not its focus | The LS is built tight with pretty good suspension | Despite the size of the engine acceleration was adequate | The interior is clean and easy to follow with no confusion among the cluster gauges | The only thing I regret when I owned the car was that I opted for the basic model | I'd strongly recommend upgrading to a higher model with automatic features because it certainly improves the convenience | The fact that ABS is not standard is disconcerting | I've not owned it a long time so the Chevrolet rapport is disconcerting | Not too sure if this car will last like a Toyota | 
 "words": Just bought my Cobalt Supercharged with 1400 miles on it | Was a demo | The car has been so much fun to drive | Getting 40 miles per gallon going easy on the highway | The sport red color with the 18 inch chrome wheels is awesome | Other than an occasional minor rattle might be beacuse it's wintertime this car is absolutely a must as long as you're not worried about a small backseat or using it for construction projects | I have a 2004 Avalanche that I now can use for carting my gear only | I'm now saving a lot on gas and wear and tear | The bottom line If you're looking for a fast and fun car to drive you've got to consider this car | Feels like the old days | Power with no worry of fuel | 
 "words": Bought this car new in March of 2007 and currently have just over 20k miles | The selling points of this vehicle were the gas mileage and comfort of the interior considering it's size | The sticker stated 24 mpg city and around 30 mpg highway | On the highway the car gets the 30 mpg but in the city I'm lucky to get 17mpg | I have a 1999 Subaru Outback with 189K miles that gets better mileage in the city | Very dissapointed | The car its self is pretty reliable | I had it to the dealer 5 times 3 for the same problem | I think the 5 trips to the dealer speaks more for the dealership than the car | Finally if you get this car step up to the LT model | No power windows or door locks gets tiresome | 
 "words": My Cobalt LS 4-door has been a great purchase and a terrific commuter car | I bought the car new for a very good price which included a rebate dealer discount and GM Card credits | Out the door with a 100K mile warranty set me back 12 | 8K | The car has 15000 miles on it and it has not needed any repairs thus far | The car is very reliable and runs flawlessly | I do the maintenance myself which is very simple | I'm pretty tall and I find the driver seat very comfortable | drive about 60 miles day so I'm in the car about 2- 1 2 hrs day | The car gets 30 mpg and has plenty of pep | The car handles pretty well for a small car | 
 "words": I've had this car for over 2 years now and have 45000 miles on it | I had to order the car because I could not find an SS with a five speed and all the options I wanted | So I hadn't test drove one when it was ordered | I've never had to take it in for service but did replace the brakes and rotors at 40000 | The interior aluminum paint has started to chip from wear and tear and the steering wheel leather has started to fade | I previously had a 2005 Grand Am GT and it was in the shop twice in the 2 years I owned it | The Grand Am had more get up and go than the cobalt but it was a V6 automatic | Decent car for the price but some improvements could be made | Back seat is extremely comfortable for a coupe
 "words": I have an 07 SS Coupe | I drive a lot | My gas mileage has been less then desirable with getting at the most 27mpg highway | I have 42k on it now and at 40500 I had to have my transmission replaced | Thank goodness for extended warranties or it would have cost a fortune | Styling is great | I get a lot of looks from people because the car looks hot in black | Tires are expensive to replace and the SS is so low to the ground it doesn't clear most speed bumps without scraping | Unless you get a great deal on this car I would think twice | 
 "words": The 2007 Cobalt LS 2 door in some ways is a stylish car but from looking at the front and sides looks too much like a re-vamped Cavalier | I expected more from this car than it delivered | Gas mileage on the 2 | 2 automatic is terrible for a 4 cylinder eats far more gas than a Nissan Altima 2 | 5 4 banger and isn't half as fast in fact it's sluggish by comparrison | Comfort is basic behind the times needs better standard sound system w larger standard sized tires wheels | Vehicle is noisy inside passenger cabin and exterior paint job inferior marks chips easily | Many blind spots when parking observing on- coming traffic from behind and passing | It's a re-vamped Cavalier | 
 "words": Well to sum it up in one word the word nightmare comes to mind | The car is actually very nice to drive handles better than my Mustang ever did and it has just enough pep to get me into trouble | However let me tell you the bad about it | There is this rather loud annoying rattle which can not be figured out by two different dealerships | Had it in five times parts replaced every time and still nothing | Also it has this little issue that makes it not start at the most of inconvenient of times | No one can figure that one out either | I will tell you that to me this car is the biggest waste of money and GM integrity that I have ever encountered | GM Build a better Cobalt | 
 "words": I now have over 10500 mi on the car and its still without any problems | I took the car to the shop 3 times Once for an oil change and 2 because of something I did Bent a rim and hit a deer | I abuse this car and it still treats me great | I'm now getting 30-37MPG depending on how I drive | The front tires are now starting to show noticeable wear | My only big gripe with the car is the noisy wheel covers | They squeak and rattle over bumps and it makes the car seem like less quality than it actually is | Next time I'm getting alloys | I still get compliments on the looks | Why are people still buying imports | Chevy packs quality value dependability and fun all in one car | Check this one out | 
 "words": For all of you out there that buy foreign because of the so called superior reliabilty this car is for you | Well built fun to drive excellent quality for your money |
