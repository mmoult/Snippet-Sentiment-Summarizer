REVIEWS
 "words": If you are looking for a slightly used cross over I highly recommend the Dodge Magnum instead | First Dodge I've owned and I love it | Fantastic alternative to those boring CUVs | I drove Jeeps for 12 years last 3 was a Commander and wanted something better on gas but more fun on the road | The Magnum has a deeper cargo area than our Nissan Murano '07 SL costs less and is 100 more fun to drive | My wife discovered this too and now I have to hide the keys to the Magnum | My daughter is 3 but already demands HEMI | RT package is excellent the torque from the HEMI is intense but refined and smooth at normal speeds | Visibility is perfect with an aftermarket rear view mirror | 
 "words": I've already put 50000 miles on this awesome machine and it still drives like it's brand new | My dogs like the cargo space my family loves the ample leather space inside | I feel like this car is just going to go on forever like an old pickup truck would | I think the hemi and the heavy duty transmission are unstoppable | 
 "words": I worked the dealership for 14mos | and drove all models available from SE to SRT | The 2 | 7L V6 in the SE just isn't powerful enough for a 4000 lb car especially in steep climbs and it dosen't have ESP like the SXT and higher models | I purchased my SXT because the 3 | 5 L V6 has a very good track record of reliability and I could not afford the RT at the time | If you can afford the RT GET IT instead of the SXT | If you can't the SXT has most of the base features the RT has including the 5 speed autostick trans | Use a high grade motor oil I use CASTROL GTX or SYNTEC and have noticed an increased gas mileage of almost 5 mi | gal | Some recalls exist get them executed ASAP | Nice car | 
 "words": Station Wagon on steroid fun to drive with enough power on Hwy and city | Very good AWD | But | I had to bring the vehicle twice to Dodge for engine failure | First time one of my valve broke second time the engine stall the warning light stays on and | still waiting for teh results | Not a reliable car 
 "words": I was a 4wd driver for over 20yrs and decided because I live closer to work now and mileage is more of a concern I traded my 2005 silverado with all the toys and whistles in on my magnum | It handles like a dream | I have already gotten my very first speeding ticket at age 51 as it goes quick a little too easy | I am not used to a lower profile and taking curves in the road is fun but it is great and the mileage is great too | The interior is a little lacking on mine but I don't spend that much time in it so it isn't a big deal | The stereo is better than I thought and it seems to be reliable so far | Over all I like my car | 
 "words": I've owned a lot of cars from muscle cars to high-end european and this car is the absolute best buy ever | The performance handling looks and capacity are all incredible for the price paid 25K with 8000 miles on it | I have spent many hours driving over mountain passes and interstates in horrible winter weather and this baby is rock solid | Maybe it's the Mercedes all wheel drive | 
 "words": Best car I have ever owned | The looks the interior space and enough whip for V8 models and up | Good gas mileage for 340hp getting 19-20 Could have gotten better quality interior but very quiet and comfortable inside | Drove to NC and handled awesome around mountain roads | I test drove v6 and there is a big drop off | Go Hemi the best route to go | 
 "words": I own a 1969 Superbee 1971 Cuda a 1981 Corvette and I have as much fun and more comfort in the Magnum as I do in all of the other cars I own | If you are looking for a car I would highly recommend the Magnum | Dodge has discontinued this car which I think is very foolish | 
 "words": The car is very clean cut and has an aggressive look which I like | The horsepower sucks and wish I got the hemi model for that reason | Space and comfort is great though | Gas mileage stinks and I don't have a heavy foot | 
 "words": I bought a used 07 after renting an 08 | Mine is 3 | 5L RWD Inferno Red Pearl | BEE | UTIFUL | All leather and great stock stereo | Lots of space for my 3 tall teens | Awesome styling very different from anything out there | A modern muscle car regardless of engine size | Joined a Magnum owners club last night and can't wait to cruise with all you Muscle Mag owners out there | 
 "words": This car turns heads for a second look by all ages | Fun car to drive I would have bought the 425 horse model if it weren't for price of gas | 
 "words": This Magnum R T has Performance package | Bought it usedhad 15000 km built in July '07 | Fun to drive | So far no issues | Get between 25-27 MPG when cruising with MDS engaged | 
 "words": Very attractive body style | My RT has 18s nothing special but I do plan on getting better performance tires and wheels after my first year with the car 8 | 08 | Agree with some of the past comments about interior design could've done better especially that cruise control stick on the left | Had to add Navigational 6-CD and BlueTooth for convenience | could use audio controls on the steering wheel another option | Blind spots can be trick at times but when driving defensively not that big of a problem | But still a problem | Brakes now beginning to squeak at 10K need to have them checked out at next service |

 "words": Great Ride | Fun to drive | I got the SXT with leather sun roof huge opening 3 | 5L V6 | The 3 | 5 liter has great performance for the size of the ride | I think the 2 | 7L would be too small but just an opinion | Love the smooth ride a lot of people don't know most of the suspension parts are Mercedes Benz | HUGE amount of cargo space in the back | And has a lot of great standard features | Would highly recommend to anyone looking for an SUV type cabin but a luxury type of ride | Cons Cruise Control Stick design takes getting used to | Some blind spots on the sides of wind shield | Parking is kind of tough since its a long ride | A lot of backing out and straightening to get into spaces | 
 "words": Fun car to drive | I installed a Jet chip to even out the sluggish starts | I can't complain though it is only a V6 3 | 5L and not a Hemi | The chip worked nicely | Next is a KN Air intake cheap ways to gain a few more ponies | 
 "words": Every time I see my car I can't believe how good it looks | hat a beautiful fun to drive vehicle it is | I wouldn't mind having one of the bigger engines however I enjoy the gas mileage and can't complain about power or acceleration | Overall I'm very satisfied with my car it gets me from point a to point b in style and comfort | 
 "words": I had to decide what kind of car I was gonna get | I was more than surprised to realise that I was going to be buying an American Car that wasn't a Jeep | After owning 3 BMW's I was sure a European car would be sitting in the driveway but wow | The Magnum has been a favorite design since they hit the streets | After driving it the handling the fit and finish the interior the solid feel of well thought out construction and most importantly the way I feel when I'm driving this car | How did Dodge manage to keep the vehicle so tame and peaceful on the inside | It kinda feels like a Mercedes | OK maybe it is the Daimler influence on Dodge | 
 "words": Nice comfortable car with lousy windows and mediocre controls | What were they thinking | Hard to see stoplights tops of hills etc | through narrow low windshield the back has a narrow slit that gets dirty fast and is hard to see much in the rear either | Only question was where to mount the machine gun in the bunker | The cruise control trip odometer are poorly located and designed who needs an extra left handed stalk that runs right across the gas gauge | Did you hit the turn signal or the cruise control | Bad design | Controls and instruments have been much better designed in nearly all cars for over 50 years | Styling just to be different just dosen't cut it | 
 "words": We recently took a 2300 mile trip in the car with four people and full of luggage no problems | Ran great average 20 | 9 mpg even with a few high speed bursts | 
 "words": This is the affordable fun wagon I was waiting for | V6 engine is plenty but the SRT8 would be a dream | 
 "words": This car is wild | It actually drives like a race car | It gives reasonable economy with tremendous power
