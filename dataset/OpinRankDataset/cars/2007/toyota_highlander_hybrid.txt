REVIEWS
 "words": Overall a good car with good Toyota quality | The biggest complaint is the battery in the gas engine dies if a door is left slightly ajar or a light is left on once that battery is dead the car will not start despite being full of batteries | ppl laugh when I say the battery died on my hybrid | We bought a portable jump start kit and it works great | Otherwise a good vehicle | Price is a bit high | Mileage is good but not great when gasoline prices spiked I felt smart but the added cost is hard to justify although it is an improvement for the environment over a regular SUV | Would recommend this car | 
 "words": We have enjoyed our hybrid for 2 | 5 years and consistently score 22 | 6 MPG | It doesn't seem to matter how we drive or if we are towing our RV or not always the same 22 | 6 MPG | Can this be accurate | Of course this mileage is great when towing the RV but the next tank without the RV in tow is EXACTLY the same | How could this be statistically possible | We reset the counter on every tank | Otherwise we love the car | 
 "words": This was our first Toyota | This is a great SUV | Nice lines | It is solid and well built | Has nice fit and finish but the dash lights and radio are not all the same color backlighting | Should be uniform | Increased hybrid price was not worth it | I liked being green but the extra cost was not worth it | Back seat needs separate AC controls Aft is hot in the summer | Cup holders needed to be better designed | Third seat is pretty tight but this is not a big truck so you get what you pay for | We tow a double jet ski trailer and it does a great job | No lag or drag | 
 "words": We bought this car with being green in mind and turned out to be a big disappointment | Gas mileage is not what was expected | Battery has failed three times | Seat heaters are mediocre | Horrible noise in car when back seat windows are down or cracked | Where is the Bluetooth option | IPod option | Third seat is for pets not sized for humans | Will not own another one | 
 "words": This SUV is the best | We love the way it handles | People stop us all the time to ask about it | Mileage isn't the same as claimed | The mileage is great for a small SUV | 22-23 | One month we only spent 40 in gas | Easy to drive | 
 "words": We have had our Highlander for 2 years and love it | We have found after driving for two years you have to pay attention to what is on to get great mileage | In the winter if you run the heater constantly you will lose mileage | Use a combination of heated seats and defrost then our mileage is around 25 mpg | In summer when we run just vent and windows up we have seen 35 mpg but usually we get 33 mpg because we like air conditioning | Definitely better mileage in summer | But overall great ride good touring vehicle | Have had problems with people not hearing the SUV when we start to back up | We have to take extra precautions to make sure we don't surprise people walking to their cars | 
 "words": This is my first experience with a hybrid and I was somewhat apprehensive | My first year has been a wonderful experience | I did need to adjust some of my driving habits | My determination for decent gas mileage keeps me on my toes and attuned to the workings of the hybrid motor | So far I am very pleased and would go hybrid again | 
 "words": We love our Highlander hybrid | We have had the vehicle for almost 2 years | Mileage is great | I want people to know that we were in a serious car accident | Both front airbags deployed and 3 point seat belt did their job | My husband and I walked away with only a few bruises and banged up ribs | We hope the car can be repaired and not totaled by insurance company | We are missing the first 12 to 16 inches of the front end of car | The other car in the accident did not fare as well | Definitely our SUV is a well built safe vehicle | If we have to get a new SUV we are definitely going to get the Highlander Hybrid | We can't say enough about the safety features on the car | 
 "words": MSRP 41K for OK vehicle with poor MPG | Heated seats don't work toyota can't won't fix them | Resale will be bad with defective options still under warranty | Waranty only good if munafacturer desides to fix it | Good takeoff and ride | Need more options bluetoothsteering wheel controlsetc | Two slow leak alloy rims other cars have similar leaks | Won't buy toyota again | 
 "words": Have had the vehicle over a year overall pleased w the quiet engine running on battery | Disappointed by mileage highest ever for brief time mpg | Mostly got the car for environ'l purposes but still expected mpg a little closer to sticker estimates | According to what I've read here I would have still bought the vehicle as most owners report better mileage but why are some of us not even though I drive carefully do a lot of coasting etc | There seems to be no help through the dealership | Don't like the jerk of motor at times as it starts up | otherwise like the look and handling of vehicle while driving | 
 "words": Great power acceleration | Mileage not nearly as good as advertised | Even in winter driving 'softly' I get about 24 MPG | 
 "words": If you hate vans and Suburbans but need seating for 7 in a pinch this is your machine | Very cool to be green too | I traded my Sienna AWD van for the Highlander Hybrid | Perfect for in-town 28 mpg in an SUV wow | and long trips | No one can tell it is a hybrid totally quiet and smooth as it switches between engine to battery | It runs on 100 battery as you sail thru the grocery store parking lot be careful | it is sooo quiet people do not know you are there | Good ride and handling in town and on highway | AWD is a must for me in snowy Pennsylvania and I have not been disappointed | Beautiul leather inside | truly a fabulous vehicle | Go hybrid | 
 "words": Edmunds says this should not be bought as a serious snow vehicle | If you'll be towing a heavy trailer of snowmobiles and going on really rough terrain they may be right | But if you will be on normal roads paved or not and you live where it snows a lot don't hesitate to buy this vehicle | I live at 9000ft in the mtns of Colorado and it has performed extremely well in all conditions including steep snowy driveways | The AWD works great and I love the B gear which allows me to slow down without braking no matter what speed I am going | This is very helpful in slippery conditions and I am able to use the brakes very lightly if at all sometimes great for the highway | We love this car | 
 "words": After driving a full-size pickup for 8 years this was a big change for me | Overall the Highlander is comfortable and roomy | Toyota has a great reputation for durability and I haven't had any complaints about performance or reliability | My complaints so far are these in reverse only the electric motors run the vehicle no matter how far you push the accelerator | Not necessarily Toyota's brightest idea | There are no always-on 12v power outlets | Not surprising but still occaisonally inconvenient | The oil filter is darn near impossible to take off by hand unless you're left-handed | I have to use a filter wrench | There is no driver override on the AWD system the car decides for you | 
 "words": The reason we chose this car over the Lexus SUV hybrid was the cargo size | The nav system is primitive and not user friendly works sort of the passenger seat doesnt have adjustable lumbar support so on long trips gets tiresome | The good part is fuel efficiency and room for all kinds of stuff including kids pets groceries plants and necessities of life especially on long trips | The third seat is a waste in my opinion | For our particular needs the car fits the bill | Of all the hybrids out there with cargo room this is in my view the best choice and nicely appointed | 
 "words": Bought for economy | Hwy 26 mpg city 32 mpg thus almost reaching rating of 28 34 | Excellent power smooth transition between gas and electric transmission shifts seemlessly | Dealer service dept very fast for scheduled service | Zero maintenance problems in 31000 miles | Very quiet operation in city and highway | Big enough to haul stuff like power washer wheel barrow construction materials etc | We are very pleased with the vehicle | 
 "words": After owning what was supposed to be the pinnacle German brand and having nothing but problems during my ownership experience I decided to give Toyota a try | The Highlander itself is not very interesting to me but the hybrid really caught my imagination | I drove it and was immediately impressed with the combination of comfort power roominess and economy | A year later all I can say is that Toyota has actually exceeded all my expectations | The car has been 100 reliable and both my wife and I truly love it | It's rare that you have a car that is comfortable fast easy to drive and helps you do your part for the environment | It's great plain and simple | 
 "words": Very smooth acceleration | Solid in turns | Well built vehicle | 
 "words": Purchased at dealer in MD | Drove 315 miles home | 1 3 interstate 70 mph 27 mpg and 2 3 country roads 55 mph 30 mpg | Since city highway 29 mpg and interstate 70 mph 28 mpg | Good ride and acceleration | Looking to tow 2500lb boat | 
 "words": I had a hard time finding a Limited Edition AWD and had to settle for a FWD and put in my own Nav system | I am very pleasantly surprised with the vehicle and how fun it is to drive | The side mirrors give great visibility and I put a rear camera on the Pioneer Nav system I bought to cover directly behind the vehicle for backing up and parking | I looked around for a hybrid for my family and this is the best of the 07s | The 08s looked nicer but I didn't think I could get it in my garage and the hybrid wasn't going to be out till October and I wanted to catch the last 650 in tax credits which expire end of Sept for Toyota | Very pleased | 
 "words": The Highlander is so much fun to drive | The fuel mileage is great | It's comfortable and handles bumps better than my large SUV | 
 "words": Purchased the Highlander Hybrid and now have about 1100 miles on the vehicle | It is a comfortable car to ride in and drives very good | Exception noted wife drives a car with a V8 and on the highway can get over 30 miles per gallon yet with the new hybrid the most I can do is 22 mpg up hill down hill city or road | This is nowhere near what is advertised for this vehicle | 
 "words": I have been driving my new 4WD hybrid Highlander Limited Edition with leather interior package for 3 weeks and love every bit of the experience | Filling the gas tank is just like refueling my regular car but the performance screams luxury | I am still getting used to the super quiet electric engine and I can actually hear Mozart's piano concertos quite well thanks to the insulation | 
 "words": I'm loving my Highlander Hybrid | Gas mileage has been great between 27-29 mpg so far | I have about 4000 miles on it | Plenty of pep handles beautifully looks good decent cargo space I used to own a minivan so it's definitely smaller safe | It's not nearly as good on the gas mileage if you are on the highway riding over 75 mph or stomping on the gas around town | But if you ride smooth you should easily get 27 mpg or even up to 29 mpg | I read a lot of comments previously that it was hard to reach this | Piece of cake | 
 "words": The best thing about this car is the drive train | Interior is awful starting with the electronics | No tire pressure monitor no satellite radio no backup camera | Nav system is primitive | Dash is out of the early 1990s | No two zone climate control and silly 3rd row seats | Toyota blew it this could have been an awesome vehicle | 
 "words": Finishing up first year with this car | Gas mileage is nowhere close to EPA estimates nor what others here are claiming | Best was 27 mpg in the first month downhill ever since | The only way to get close to the EPA estimate would be to drive it purely in stop and go city driving | Also mileage dropped off dramatically in the winter months | Hard pressed even in mostly city driving to get over 21 mpg | Beyond the lousy mileage it's a pretty good SUV | Not a lot of cargo room but good comfort for the passengers and driver | Gas engine works well good power handles freeway speeds well | Handling is not that crisp but this is a truck | Good fit and finish | No problems or defects in 1 year | 
 "words": My job requires that I drive every day anywhere from 10 to 30 miles one way | I'm getting 27 | 5 mpg compared to the 14 from my previous SUV | That's both highway and city driving | I'm hoping to increase mpg slowly | That being said so far my HH has been great | Happy that I don't visit the gasoline station as often as before | Quiet ride love it that the car engine is on electric and isn't using up gas | Don't notice the change from gas to electric anymore | Maybe it got better or I just don't notice | Smooth ride and great handling | The little plus is that I'm not putting out any greenhouse gases as one reviewer put it | This puts a smile on my face | 
 "words": Overall it is a very nice car | This is the second hybrid I bought this year my first was a Ford Escape | The power of the HH far exceeds the Ford but it cost you 6-7 mpg | The HH is more spacious and I am confident the resale will be better but I do enjoy driving the Ford more than the HH | 
 "words": With so much horsepower under the hood it | s hard to save money on gas | What incredible acceleration for an SUV | You wont miss this shifting of gears either | 
 "words": I love the vehicle but would like some options | I would like door locks that lock when vehicle in drive and unlock in park | I would like to have the 115 volt plug option more available | I would love an MP3 adapter in the front of the radio plus Bluetooth | What were they thinking | I have a 2005 Prius and the smart key option is great why not in the Highlander | 
 "words": I have only had my Highlander for about a month but I really like it | Its fun to drive and I'm getting over 28 miles per gallon | I drove the lexus version and it was a great car but not for the extra money over the Toyota | The Toyota is a very comfortable car | 
 "words": I'm still a very new owner but my first two tankfuls in mixed city highway driving have been 28 | 4 MPG and 28 | 6 MPG | Based on the EPA sticker I was hoping for even more but what I'm getting is still 60 BETTER than my last SUV | I'll save 1000 in gasoline every year with this vehicle based on my year-long predicted average of 2 | 699 gallon | 
 "words": I've had my HH Limited w nav for about a month | Very good build quality comfortable quiet and quick w good MPG | Getting nearly 30 mpg combined | Like that the ICE runs only when necessary saving fuel | The stealth styling blends in but surprises other drivers when I press the go pedal car moves out very smartly | 
 "words": We primarily bought this car for high gas mileage fuel conservation but it's been a disappointment in that regard average 22mpg mostly city | The performance is incredible so it's clear why gas mileage is low | We also got hit with the AMT this year 2006 so we lost the entire hybrid tax credit not Toyota's fault which left a bad taste in our mouth | Overall it's still a very well built car and fun to drive if not fuel thrifty | 
 "words": I've been cringing when I read reviews from people saying that next time they'll go for a gas vehicle to get more umph | It's ALSO about doing something about the environment | Look at all the cars around you idling at red lights | They are all putting out green house gases and you are NOT | I'm averaging 30 | 4 MPG | It's fun to drive and seems solidly built | The second row seats are more roomy than my past 2002 Sienna and my teenaged skinny son sat in the 3rd row seat at an angle and was OK | Wouldn't be good for 2 people larger than your average sized 9 year old | 
 "words": My Subaru outback was on the way out the door and I was looking for a replacement | I never considered the Highlander hybrid until I visited the Toyota dealership | I took it for a 30 minute test drive and I was sold | More run more options more comfort more power more towing and better gas milage than the Subie | The hybrid Highlander is even faster than it's regular V-6 brother | JBL sound system and NAV is a real treat | Incredible passenger room for the size of the vehicle 3rd seating plus if you have kids | Vehicle is incredibly quite during city driving | 
 "words": I'm pretty content with the HiHy limited | Our gas mileage is around 26 | 5 city and 28 highway | Short trips seem to reduce the MPG | Wife loves the nav SUV visibility and fuel savings | I like the torque | The captains chair armrest is not very comfortable it needs more padding | Also we have to take ours in for a speaker wiring issue | Being car based the SUV feels light and nimble unlike others we test drove that were more body on frame based | 
 "words": I was disappointed by the fuel economy of the car | This was the major reason I bought it | Fuel economy was 19 20 mpg and I was not driving in an aggressive manner | Build quality was rather poor for price | A lot of features were missing eg there was no indication on the remaining miles in the fuel tank | Stereo system was of poor quality and sound | It felt wobbly and shaky when I drove it on the highway and did not feel very safe | The center of gravity should be a bit lower | One positive aspect was that there is plenty of room inside for two adults two kids and baggage | 
 "words": This SUV is just OK | It really gets about 22 mpg | It's nothing special and really overpriced | I may be a bit prejudiced because I also have a 2004 Prius and was expecting much better gas mileage | 
 "words": I wish this vehicle were available without the space-wasting third seat handled like an MR2 and provided the mileage of my bicycle | In the real world however this is a downright excellent vehicle | My spouse especially loves the visibility | 
 "words": We were interested in a hybrid but did not want to give up performance | A test drive sold us and subsequent use convinced us the Highlander was the correct choice | My wife drives short slow miles to work and marvels when the silent battery is in use | Even open road miles get good mileage for the weight and size of this vehicle | The ride is as excellent and better than the upscale sedan we traded in | I can | t think of a feature I would change or anything that needs improvement | 
 "words": We bought the Toyota HH 2007 just before the tax credits reduced and are very happy with our choice | The HH is fun to drive and very functional | So far we love it | 
 "words": This vehicle is co-operated by my wife and I | She gets about 28 | 5 mpg on short shopping trips and I get about 33 mpg on longer jaunts without special driving techniques and recently for 40 | 3 mpg on a 45 mile trip | That was being almost as careful as I could | We really like it | I'd give it a 9 | 5 overall rating | 
 "words": I just purchased my 2007 Highlander and have had it for about a month now | I'm blown away by the quality and ease of use of the navigation system and the overall feel of the Highlander | In the city I'm averaging 29-31 mpg with 27 mpg on the highway | I'm not a lead foot by any means but It has much more power than I thought | I love my Highlander and do not plan on letting it go before I put 100-200 thousand miles on it | 
 "words": Excellent build quality and materials | Cargo space is quite large | Rear seats are simple to manipulate | Much better MPG than expected 28 | 9 | The feel of the hybrid takes a while to get used to | My wife thought I was repeatedly taking my foot off the gas when it was the really the gas and electric cutting and out at different times | This was more pronounced when the car was brand new | 
 "words": I just purchased a new 2007 hybrid Highlander and broke it in over the holiday weekend | Drove approximately 1350 total miles | First 800 varied speed from 45-70 on 2 lane highway with lots of hills in rural areas | Averaged 29 | 1 by the dispaly and on paper | Second 550 set cruise control at 70 on interstate and averaged 28 | 7 | This seems good to me | Vehicle is very comfortable over long distances and seriously quiet | Rides nicely and handles well | Have not used AC but heater seems to work well | Am very happy with my purchase and hope that with increased mileage that the gas economy will improve | 
 "words": Took my first road trip of about 500 milies and was mildly disappointed with the fuel economy 25 MPG highway | Although only 2 MPG under the advertised 27 I drove very carefully and tried to eke out as much electric motor driving as I could | I have come to the conclusion that this is not an econo-box but simply a performance vehicle that gets the economy of a 4-cyl with the umph of an 8 | Fun to drive great pick-up and comfy | A real step up from my Subaru Outback | If given the choice all over again however I would opt for the non-hybrid 6 and spend the extra cash on a 4wd an upgraded Limited and other accessories | 
 "words": Good result | Mileage a little under claims | Excellent power and handling | Terrific quality and design | Only driving complaint is slight surging sensation on highway as electric motors kick in and out | With tax credit and some recent bargaining price reductions this is still one I would buy again | Get Limited model | 
 "words": I just had to have a 3rd row for the little ones | Adults would feel a little cramped back there | On a flat road surface I reached speeds of 50 mph on electric | You have to start off slow to accomplish this | The radio may need an upgrade | I'm not getting many stations on it | But the ride and fuel economy is worth more then you can imagine | 
 "words": We have truly enjoyed the short time we | ve driven the hybrid | Hard to get used to the lack of engine noise when at idle | Surprising performance when needed and the ride is as good or better than any sedan | Even though it is a five year lease you can not use the tax advantage | An IRS limitation not Toyota | 
 "words": Getting 25 MPG and enjoying the car alot | Good power and quiet | Only mfg | problems so far is the one of the rear seats is locked in the up position preventing a flat cargo area | I am sure the dealer can fix it |
