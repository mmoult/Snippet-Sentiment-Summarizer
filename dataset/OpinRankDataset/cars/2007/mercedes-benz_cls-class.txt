REVIEWS
 "words": In the past I have owned multiple BMWs Lexus Accura Infinities and other Mercedes models and this is by far the best of the best | The car is extremely stylish has incredible power great handling and is just all around fun to drive | There are some sacrifices in rear head room for style but I gladly accept those sacrifices not like I am back there anyway | This vehicle takes the stuffiness out of the larger luxury sedans and adds style and class that may not be for everyone | Suits me perfectly | The console controls are more intuitive than others iDrive and the packages offered combine a good set of features | 
 "words": Powerful car handles beautifully | Drivers side mirror blocks some road visibility | Car hugs you as you drive | Very much worth the money | 
 "words": Bought the car in Aug of 07 | I bought the car as a weekend car and pretty much only drive it on the weekends | the car is very powerful and very fun to drive | The tranny is a little jerky at low speeds | The exhuast note is lovely and the looks of the cars is stunning | I have had both women and men tell me the car is sexy | The car is definitely an eye turner and the stop light to stop light power is heart pumping | This car will get you into trouble real quick | I hope you enjoy it if you decide to buy | 
 "words": Excellent performance - 19 to 28 mpg - stunning looksblack- it's a head turner people comment on the vehicle 
 "words": I've owned 10 vehicles over the last 25 years and the CLS550 is unquestionably the biggest disappointment | Bottom line I've got an 80000 luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles that drives like a 1972 Fiat | Despite being in the shop 3 times in the first 90 days the vehicle continues to violently rattle and vibrate the premium sound system sounds like a transistor radio and the climate controlled seats are nothing more than a weak fan with an imperceptable effect | Two thumbs down | 
 "words": The CLS is the most stylish 4 door sedan ever | But extremely not user- friendly | Navigation entry relies on arrow keys and enter button to choose words from list instead of touchscreen keypad | It is maddening | I find myself avoiding using it | Headlight control indicator placed too low and out of sight | When in full on position it does not turn off automatically when engine is shut off | Center console storage too small | No coin holder | Door pockets blocked by seats | Wiper control on turn signal lever requires twisting instead of simpler up down motion | No rear view camera available | I am very disappointed by my first Mercedes | I will not buy another Mercedes again | 
 "words": I recently purchased the CLS550 Iridium Silver Blk interior AMG package | This car is an absolute blast to drive | There is plenty of torque in the sport mode and not sure where anyone could benefit from the 507 HP engine | I | ve owned it just 2 weeks and have 2 speeding tickets to show for it | performance is just intoxicating | The car has a stunning exterior style and resembles nothing else on the road | 
 "words": Great balance between speed sports car and luxury | Wicked fast when you want it | Super soft for cruising highway driving is great not like a big sedan but much smoother than similar speed sports cars | Four adults OK but a little tight | Great choice for sports car with the occational need for four adults | 
 "words": I just took possession of my 2007 Iridium Grey on black leather CLS550 | The combination of power comfort and style surpass any vehicle out there | If you're looking for a family sedan this is not the car for you | But if you like the appearance and performance of a coupe with the pragmatism of a 4-door sedan you are in for a pleasant susprise | The 7-speed automatic is perfectly matched to the new 5 | 5 Liter V8 with perfect compromise between fuel economy and performance | At the same time with ADS one can ride in comfort without the harshness of an overly firm sport suspension 
 "words": Really hard to find any faults in this car | Torque and power will surpass just about anything out there | Ordered mine with every option including AMG package | Really finishes off the car | Includes paddle shifters AMG exhaust and AMG styled aprons and trim | Put it in Sport 2 turn off the traction control and put it in manual mode | That's when you can really see what this car is all about | 18 inch staggered wheels really grip the road and corner effortlessly | MB really has outdone themselves with this years CLS | Can only imagine the power of the CLS63 | But this one has plenty |

 "words": I went in the dealership planning to trade in my MB for the E350 until I spotted the CLS550 in the showroom | I didn't bother checking out the E350 | I'm so happy I got the CLS550 | The car handles the road very well | Everyone stares at the car when you're on the road | It's a beauty | It's sporty and classy at the same time | 
 "words": This is my 31st Mercedes and I think it may well be the best | I did not bother with the AMG because the power is simply awesome without the 507 hp engine | The 382 suits me fine | Rarely do I use the back seat so I have no comment on its comfort level but I love the styling and feel of the car | I have owned most models of MB during the years and have always craved the sportiness of the SL and the comfort of the S | Here I have what I have always wanted | 
 "words": It is difficult for me to describe just how brilliant the CLS 63 AMG is | It really is a dream car | It simply does everything | When you are stressed tired or off to lets say the ball it will simply drive like a very comfortable and expensive saloon | However should you need to get somewhere quickly its speed will leave you breathless and with a big smile on you face | It will get you from 0-60mph in 4 | 1 seconds if you use the paddle shifts or 4 | 3 if you leave it in sport mode | Only very serious supercars like a Lambo are faster | I spent about 8 months researching the CLS range and decided there was nothing out there with this combination of beauty style performance and practicality | 
 "words": Took delivery of this beauty in Stuttgart | The Euro Delivery Program is highly recommended and will save you major bucks | Plus Mercedes really does a great job taking care of you | For those of you who need a 4-door but want a sports car there isn't anything that comes close to this car | It flies and feels like it's on rails through corners | When the governor maxed out on the Autobahn at 130 mph it still felt effortless to drive | Check it out you won't go wrong with this car | 
 "words": CLS 550 is truly a fun car to drive | Airmatic DC air suspension by all means is the best | The ride is smooth and sporty at the same time | Airmatic will automatically lower the suspension at highway speeds to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle | CLS has a very powerful engine enough power for most people | I can only wonder what the 63 65 AMG has to offer in terms of power | The car is so unique in terms of its exterior styling there is nothing like it on the road | The audio Harmon Kardon Logic 7 has exceptional sound quality | CLS is a beauty with the beast inside | 
 "words": I wanted to buy my dream car a special car that I would love to drive for a few years and would still be great looking | I researched the web extensively test drove more cars than I ever did before and decided on the CLS with the AMG package | When I first saw it it made my heart skip a beat | I have driven 3 Cadillac STSs a SAAB 900 turbo went conservative with a Volvo S80 twin turbo but this car is special | I love power and good looks and this car is awesome | I can't drive it without a smile coming to my face | 
 "words": I don't know a lot about cars but I know that I love to drive my new MB | It's so much fun but I also feel safe | Truly a dream car | 
 "words": It is about time that this beautiful sedan has the performance to match its racy looks | For the past year I had been wanting a CLS but found it performance to weak for a sedan of this class | However when I heard that for '07 MB was putting a larger engine with 80 more hp in it sealed my decision | This car is perfect and get so many looks while crusing down the road | The interior is beautifully appointed | I am very pleased | 
 "words": In terms of styling I have never been a fan of MB | This CLS 550 has changed my perception | This great looking vehicle shines like a star among others whether they are MB or its competition | Interior layout and quality are classy and luxurious with the excpetion of the cup holders which interferes with the shift stick | The new 382 horsepower V8 engine is world class and more responsive than the '06 model | Power is instantly available when needed | The drive is silky smooth | Back seats are surprisingly spacious considering this is a coupe with 2 extra doors added | Definitely 1 of the best German automobiles available currently | 
 "words": I owned a 2006 and traded it in to get the 2007 | The added horsepower torque and changes to the brake system were enough to make me buy the '07 | The added horesepower and torque is very noticeable | Other than that it is the same car as the 06 |
