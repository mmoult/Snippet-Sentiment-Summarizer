REVIEWS
 "words": I have checked mileage twice with my 4 cylinder 2 | 3 | I get 28MPG | I do not tow anything and use my truck as everyday trip around town | It rides great drives great and so far excellent service | Would highly recommend | I did my homework before buying comparing to ChevroletToyota | This Ranger beat them all hands down | Love my Ranger | 
 "words": The compact size for parking ease great old-school styling reliability and 4 | 0 V6 power are the major features that caused me to buy the Ranger over the competitors | I have not been disappointed after 32000 miles and 3 years I'd buy it again | I manage to get 16 city and 22 highway by being careful and using cruise control when I can | More than enough power for heavy loads and towing | 
 "words": I'm an assistant ranger at a Boy Scout camp | We do a lot of work and rely on good trucks | This Ranger is the best truck we've ever had great little workhorse | Does everything that our F-150 and Silverado can do and is better off-road especially on hiking trails in the woods | I've hauled trash lumber dirt gravel stone concrete tools trailers boats even another truck | In 3 years it's gotten pretty beat up at camp but I'm confident it will last for many more years then we'll buy another one | Starts up every time 4wd is great on dirt roads engine gives just enough power and it just drives and works like a bigger truck | Love this Ranger | 
 "words": The greatest thing about the Ranger is it just flat out works | Yes there are other newer trucks out there but for the money it is hard to get any better than the Ranger | I have had no problems with it | 
 "words": I've owned 2 Rangers do far and loved both | Bought my 07 with 250 miles on it and have put 38000 miles on it with out a single issue | I would buy another Ranger at the drop of a hat | My Ranger gets 22 miles per gallon only after some aftermarket parts but I love it | 
 "words": I bought this truck used | I had a 1991 Ranger that was pretty worn out and would finally start needing some repairs so I bought this one | Previously a fleet vehicle I was impressed with all that I got for 11500 dollars | XL truck but with 5 speed auto and 4 | 10 axle ratio extras were A C necessary in Ohio and an under-rail bed liner | It had a little over 18000 miles on it | I work in a scrap yard and needed a solid truck | That's just what I got with fuel economy averaging 23-28mpg combined city highway | Drives like a bigger truck and so quick too | especially for a four cyl | engine | Much stronger than my 1991's 2 | 3liter | No serious rattles and white so scratches are not an issue | 
 "words": I have the 2 | 3l 5spd standard and I love driving it | It has good take off for a 4 cylinder truck | I have 21000 miles on it and the only time it see the shop is for its regular oil changes | I get well over 34 miles to the gallon | Overall I like this truck and to think I was going to buy a Cavalier 
 "words": I'll be completely honest here | I have a bare bones 2007 ford Ranger no AC no CD no tilt no power anything and 5 speed | I love it | I commuted about 50-60 km a day each way so roughly 100- 120 a day km and I still only fuel up about every 5-6 days | I'm not talking babying it down the road I'm talking about putting my foot down and opening it up | I do my regular oil changes and tire rotation and one year and about 25000 kms later is has yet to fail me | Again I'll be honest you want power and size in a small truck | Get a Dakota | If you want reliablity and wicked MPG definitely get a Ranger | 
 "words": I have owned several Rangers and this is by far my favorite | It is an XLT w foglamps | The four cylinder performed just fine on a trip to Corpus Christi | Averaged 25 mpg for the trip | Around town I always see 19-20 mpg | 
 "words": Peppy 4 cylinder suspension stiff which is OK by me great gas mileage avg 28 30 highway drive a lot of dirt roads and no rattles after 10k | Old design but smallness helps with gas mileage | Seats are great but I'm 5'8 | Ride height good | I'll keep it until I die am 56 | I'm a Ford family | 
 "words": This was my father and I's first pickup truck and overall we are pretty satisfied | It's a decent size good off-road cap good quality reliable good-looking and fun to drive | The only thing i have a problem with is the gas mileage | During the winter i averaged about 13 | 7 City and 18 | 5 highway and during the summer about 15 | 7 city and 20 | 3 highway | This could be better | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Ranger 1st was a '95 4 | 0 STX | I like the extra room in the super cab and overall styling but not the performance | 18 mpg highway and I drive easy and no low end hp or torque | My '95 was 10 times better in low gear off road and got 23mpg to boot | I don't feel the extra hp 47 from the new engine and gas mileage flat out stinks for a V6 of this size | I've got friends with big diesels that get almost the same mileage with twice the performance | As stated by Edmunds the truck's strong point is off-road so why give it an engine that produces it's power above 3500 rpm | Have had no mechanical service issues with the truck in the first year of ownership | 
 "words": I love the way this truck rides and handles | It can take a beating and the 4x4 is something you need especially in New England winters | I've gotten as high as 25 | 6 mpg in the summer | It's preety good on gas for a 4 | 0 v-6 compared to other competitors 4 | 0's | I reccomend this truck for some one that want a truck that can get low to moderate jobs done | 
 "words": I got it to save fuel | It gets 24 to 29 | 5 | Most of the time I get over 26 | 5 | Runs out goodrides good and handles great | Only holds 4 quarts of oil | Saves money going and coming | 
 "words": Very reliable so far comfortable plenty of power for hauling yet easy to park | Decent gas mileage getting 16 22 better than advertised | 
 "words": My new Ranger has been in the shop 13 times in one year 7 times in the past 2 months-Only has 15000 km | Problems started first month-serious clunking in the steering in mid-turn when accelerating from stop | Inner Tie rod ends have been replaced 4 times in 2 monthsc- last ones were Ford's new improved ones as a result of TS Bulletins and serious problems | Also had intermediate shaft replaced twice and lower steering shaft once | Finally no clunking only been a week I am wary | Dealer told me several other owners have the same problem | Ford avoiding a recall | In my mid-40s owned 28 vehicles all makes | never had such an unreliable piece of metal in the driveway and I am a Ford fan | 
 "words": Just past the One Year of Ownership mark and all's well | In that time my Ranger has yet to so much as rattle and this despite 22K L | A | miles in a single year | As I've stated in my earlier reviews by 2007 truck standards my Ranger borders on antique | Literally every other truck on the market rides more smoothly get better gas mileage and provides greater and more cleverly packaged interior spaces | That said however few offer Ranger's total combo of rugged styling just right size and seemingly military- spec durability | For those desiring a classic comfortable little truck adeptly able to tackle your basic chores without busting your bank account | Ranger's still 1 | 
 "words": It's been close to a year now and 10000 miles with no problems at all | With the 4 | 0 and automatic I just got 22mpg on a recent trip regularly getting 16 around town | That's not bad for as much power as it has | Handles like a truck not a car and that's how a truck should handle | 
 "words": I bought the FX4 because of the rugged look | It's a fun truck to drive but gets horrible gas mileage | Then again what do you expect with 31' tires and 4 | 10 gears | 
 "words": I needed a new vehicle for driving to work and back and decided to get a lower cost pickup so I could haul stuff if I needed to | This little truck feels bigger than it is and runs great | I have averaged 29 mpg just driving it around the area and to work and back and have gotten as high as 36 mpg on longer highway freeway trips | I can't complain about anything in this vehicle | 
 "words": Third Ranger and love this truck | FX4 option well woth the price | Great off road and good in town | Interior is perfect for a off road truck | 
 "words": Nearly 16000 miles on my 07' Sport Supercab and all's well | Even after that many abusive L | A | miles in only 7 months my truck has yet to so much as rattle | Without any exaggeration it feels as though this truck was assembled for military duty | so perfectis the build quality | Granted it's still the most dated appliance in its genre but certainly that 1000 years of production history has served to iron out any bugs from the system | For anybody looking for a classic compact truck without pretense of just rightsize and certainly impeachable build quality Ranger warrants a solid look | 
 "words": I originally picked up this Ranger FX4 Level ll because of price | All the foreign trucks were considerally more expensive | I have a feeling this is an American website so I hope you can relate | It is completely loaded with leather power everything A C six-disk changer a class three trailer hitch bed liner and something Ford calls Wear and Tear Package | Essentialy this truck can be returned with up to 3500 damage at the end of the lease for which I can walk away from having to pay | All for 361 | a month taxes in for three years | Hell they're giving these trucks away | And this truck looks absolutely awesome 
 "words": Overall not a bad truck | Great off-road with the limited slip differential | Manual trans does well with no slippage | Body is okay but a little to much plastic for my personal liking | 
 "words": I recently brought a Ford Ranger Fx4 level 2 due to its low price and standard options on the vehicle | My experience with this truck it ain't great | After 2 weeks of driving the wheel alignment was off battery died have to get it boost | The truck is a gas guzzler | It doesn't provide a lot of power throttle response is very slow | Bottom line the truck isnt worth buying | Ford commercial looks good on TV but where they get you is when you purchase their vechicle | 
 "words": This is my second Ranger and I am very pleased with my past experience 1993 and my recent purchase | These trucks are tough and well built | My 93 never left me beside the road | I gave it to a family member and they are still driving it every day | Thanks Ford I love my Ranger | 
 "words": 3 months 6500 miles and all's well | Thus far my Ranger's been as regular and reliable as an atomic clock and L | A | traffic what is | I drive the heck out of my little truck | I still couldn't imagine myself in any other vehicle Ranger's perfect fit size tossable handling excellent ergonomics and so far bullet-proof quality make this truck a clear winner for me | While far from the most modern or refined choice on the market for anyone looking for a real and wholly usable little pick-up that well equipped won't break the bank Ranger certainly warrants a look | 
 "words": Purchased as a no frills work truck package | Love the dark grey color | It sits high so I can see above the traffic | I love this truck and its American soul | It drives like a truck it sounds like a truck it handles like a truck | I wouldn't have it any other way | 
 "words": I am very pleased with my Ranger | It easy and fun to drive and I really like the styling | The suspension is firm but not harsh and the steering response is excellent with good feedback | The automatic transmission's shifts are smooth and precise | The I4 engine has plenty of power and has no problem keeping up with 75 mph traffic | The ABS provides excellent straight line stops | The instrumentation is laid out well and all of the controls are within easy reach | The cloth bench seat is comfortable with good support | Fit and finish on my Ranger is good | There are no rattles or squeaks and wind noise at 75 mph is low | The fuel mileage is good at 26 mpg in combined street highway driving
 "words": I got the 2 door SuperCab XL about three months ago | The Ranger is really not that bad a truck for the price | My biggest complaint would be that something has come loose between the headliner and the trim on the right side of the truck and it makes a buzzing sound right in my left ear | I'm gonna have the dealership take a look at this | I think the interior could use some more attention to detail too | This truck has SEVEN different intermittent settings for the windshield wipers but has exposed bolts holding the radio fan control console onto the dash | Do we really need seven different wiper speeds | That aside the truck really runs well and the gas mileage is great | 
 "words": I need both a commuter vehicle and something I could haul things with and found the perfect vehicle to do both | This truck gives me great gas mileage while allowing me to do the numerous weekend chores that require a pickup bed | The 2 | 3L engine is responsive and well suited for a vehicle of this weight | The 5 speed manual tranny adds a bit of fun as well | The price was very reasonable under 13000 with A C | Great value | 
 "words": I special ordered this truck with all the options I wanted | I waited about 6 weeks for it to come in | After a few weeks I noticed light spots in the paint on the cab sides while in direct sunlight | I did not notice this before since it had been overcast | The problem was pretty bad so I let warranty handle it | Now the metallic in the paint does not match | The dealer and Ford think this is acceptable and not noticeable but everyone else notices it without me pointing it out | Now I have a new truck that I do not even want | The dealers response is that is the best the paint match will be | No more Fords for me | I am considering taking a hit and buying another product | I am extremely hacked off | 
 "words": Purchased 4 cylinder with automatic 07 Ranger based in part on positive reviews | Found truck to have poor build quality with little support from Ford | Makes excessive vibration from exhaust and very loud transmission whine in low gear | Dealer and Ford customer relations say this is normal for this type vehicle | Vehicle in shop 4 times within first month of ownership | Paint on tail gate and bed sides has large metallic runs | Door out of alignment | Ford fix for exhaust vibration is to install clamped on weight on exhaust pipe aft of converter | Fixed door alignment problem | I'm afraid to have paint work fixed as the color won't match | Buyers better due your due diligence before purchase | 
 "words": Purchased 4 cylinder with automatic | Idle is very rough with vibration through steering wheel | Returned to dealer 2 times | Dealer said motor mounts and exhaust needed alignment | No help | Checked this vehicle against other similar vehicle at dealer and found other vehicle to be smoother | When idle increased 25 to 50 RPM smooths out to normal | Dealer says Idle can not be adjusted | Had several 4 cylinder vehicles and all idle smooth | Dealer says that's the way Rangers are it can not be fixed | Looks like I am stuck with rough running new vehicle | Should have purchased Japanese | 
 "words": I love this small truck | My first tank of gas got 31mpg | My second tank got 34mpg | With a 14100 drive out price it's a great deal | 
 "words": Just purchased my shiny new Ranger Sport Supercab this past Sunday | Traded in a Mercury Sable for what'll be my third Ranger and hopefully not my last | Mine is well equipped with the power package tilt cruise 6CD etc | Certainly there exists and I could have chosen a roomier more powerful and even more efficient truck but few of these if any would have offered Ranger's combination of just-right sizing proven safety and long term durability | For me for the money and for the long haul Ranger fits like a pair of old shoes | Trading in my second one a few years back was about the stupidest thing I ever did and I couldn't be more elated to once again own my dream truck | 
 "words": I have always wanted a small truck with great looks as well as guts | When I saw the 2007 Ford Ranger I fell in love | It does everything you need it to do and more | I was looking around at other trucks to haul my bikes and things | The 3 | 0 V6 option is worth it | It's great on gas and performance and is fun to drive | 
 "words": I am sure I'm one of the select few who have traded down from a 2006 Tacoma to a 2007 Ranger | My brief 2 | 7 5M SR5 Taco experience included two trips to the dealer for a bad rear end in which the whole pumpkin was replaced and two trips for a clutch shift problem that wasn't resolved | The Tacoma is vastly over-rated | My 4x4 was bone jarring on the road had no torque shifted like a bucket of bolts and got just 20-21 mpg | But so much for Yota bashing | My 2 | 3L XLT gets GREAT mileage 31 mph shifts smoothly and has enough power to get up about any hill without downshifting | Yep the platform is dated but it still looks good works hard and is really worth what you pay | 
 "words": Ok i admit it I love big trucks | In fact I almost bought a Sierra work truck for 11900 this summer but couldn't get past the 17 mpg I'd be getting | So I went to the Ford Dealer and looked at the Rangers | I bought an XLT long bed 4 cylinder 5 speed model and it's been great | Great on gas great on performance and great on usefulness | The 2 | 3 liter motor is torqued down well and the size of the bed for a compact truck is great | A real 7 foot long bed tops Toyota and Chevy | The exterior of the Ranger is a timeless well executed design | It is a truck so you do feel bumps however tooling around town getting 28 mpg is fine with me | The inside is nothing new but there has been some updates | 
 "words": I bought this truck to haul motorcycles and go camping in the deep woods | This truck is a little monster and is capable of outperforming some of the larger full-size pickups when it comes to off-roading due to its smaller size and lighter weight | The larger wheels Torsen rear-end 4 wheel drive and Bilstein shocks make this truck fun to drive | It performs well in the city as well | It can get between 250 and 400 miles on city or highway roads | It drives really smooth on the highway | The interior and exterior styling is excellent and I would recommend getting the Pioneer sound system as the stock radio and speakers are a little weak | Overall an excellent truck for the adventurer | 
 "words": We just bought this vehicle and I must say it is much more stylish than some of the previous years | love the new front | The inside is a little narrow widthwise | Headroom is just okay | Plenty of leg room | Wish seats in the extended cab were standard | Very cute little truck | hope it lasts a good while | Ford does offer an undercoating for rust protection for 299 but I elected not to get it | I would recommend this truck over Chevy Dodge GMC etc | It is not a bad value for the price | The dark gray looks very sporty |
