REVIEWS
 "words": I previously owned a 2005 CTS and loved it | Lease was up so I purchased a used 2 | 8 with low mileage | Exterior and interior appearance is great as well as the comfort ride however I just hate the 2 | 8L engine | I will be planning to get another CTS 3 | 6 as soon as I can | 
 "words": I've owned the 05' and newer Accords and Camrys and the CTS is a far better vehicle for the money | It is a beautiful car and not just another SEDAN | It's sporty and I love it | Not a single problem | Father in-law owns a 2006 and has never had any trouble | So I decided it was my turn to have one | 
 "words": Great car excellent accelleration one of the smoothest cars I've ever driven | Smooth ride and stylingtypical of a Cadillac | Color is Thunder Gray a 3 | 6 liter v-6 with a chrome wire mesh grill | Wife also loves the and nimble response and the tight steering | We should have bought this car a long time ago | 
 "words": I love my CTS Sport it has the 18 Wheel performance and appearance package handles very well for the size | Not quite as well as my previous Audi and Porsche but very nice for a larger car | Love the shiftable automatic | Only issue was a broken rear sway bar replaced by the warranty | Cadillac has an excellent Certified Pre- owned program | 6 years 100000 miles
 "words": Fun to drive rides great drives great handles great tight in rear seat behind tall driver tough to get in and out of deep door cills | Fit and finish is good | Very little maintenance issues | 
 "words": My CTS Cadillac is nothing but problems | Major engine repair at 5 months and issue for over a year | Then again Major engine issue at 19months | The car has been a nightmare and the dealership is even worse to deal with in this regard | I would never buy another Cadillac nor deal with GM | I can't believe the poor level of customer service and then the poor level of quality of the car | I do like the style and look of the car but it is a poor poor quality car | It is upsetting as you expect a Cadillac to be the best not the worse | 
 "words": First Cadillac I've ever owned picked it over an Infiniti M35 due to dealer location | Sport model with 18 wheels limited chrome and spoiler definitely turns heads | For the most part it performs up to its looks which is pretty decent considering its weight and 255 HP | Interior is much improved in the 2008 but very plasticky in the 2007 | Not up to previously owned BMW 740i Mercedes SL Jag XK or even Chrysler LHS | Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable | handling very good | braking powerful | Standard 18 summer sport tires abysmal in fall winter which led to all-season replacement after 4000 miles at my expense | Overall mileage of 19 | 2 | Next vehicle | Accura or Lexus mid-size SUV | 
 "words": I haven't had a very good experience with my CTS I have had major repairs and the car is only 1 yr and 5 months | I love the look of the car and the features But would like to try another CTS because I think I ended up with a defective model | 
 "words": I've had this car for about six months now and I love it even more than I did on day one | It's my second car in the entry luxury market with my first being the '98 328i | I know how much I really love this car because all I want to do is dress her up and take her out on the town | My only complaints are related to comfort and interior design | After about one hour in this car I want stop and fix the pain in my back no matter how I adjust the seats | Our 2002 Camry XLE seating and interior features are superior to the Cadillac which is a shame | We'll never use this car for road trips | This car was a poor choice with two young kids in the back seat | In so many ways it reminds me of the 328
 "words": My family has a long story with Cadillacs | I remember the 1st Seville and I remmeber how much I loved it | Now I'm in love all over again | This car is fast agile and a huge improvement over the Caddies of the past | It's so good to see thant GM has finally seen the light | My only regret I should have waited couple months for the '08 but what the heck I'm in love | 
 "words": Quality and and reliability are above expectations | No problems to report to date with heavy freeway miles | 
 "words": I really enjoy the sporting look and feel of the car as it is very responsive with an excellent turning radius | However the interior noise is annoying at speeds around 42-47 miles per hour you will hear a slight humming noise | I am going back for the second timeime to have this looked at | I am not happy about the noise level with the inside cabin ride | Just not up to standards of Cadillac | 
 "words": Great car shows Cadillac understands how to put together great product | Exclellent styling edgy unique and attractive | On a cost basis performance exceeds competitors and seems a better value | Love the evolution to the '08 as well | Cannot wait to see the new CTS in Thunder Gray with in a coupe next year maybe GM will do rumored convertible | If so I may have to trade mine in on a new one | 
 "words": This car hugs the road like it's on rails | Amazing performance for a luxury car | Good power firm yet comfortable ride | Superb Bose radio XM and OnStar | Refined interior sleek exterior | 
 "words": This vehicle drives well but does not reach the EPA mileage | Has the larger engine not the V-8 and performs well | Noisy inside on rough roads the combo of shocks suspension and body results in some annoying reverberation over bumps | There was no plan for the back seat passenger AC on a par with the cheapest Chevy on the lot | If you want the back seat cooled you have to run the AC fans on high and freeze out the front seat | Trunk does not have the closer system it needs a big slam to shut | 
 "words": having a car like this was for me the greatest experience ever as the car gave me that sense of control which you normally do'nt get from other vehicles | for me it's a dream coming true | 
 "words": I bought this car because it was American | At first I thought it looked cool but after 3 months the styling looks outdated and ugly | The engine is weak and could use some hints from BMW | The interior function is not impressive for the misplacing of buttons | I was going to look at the new CTS but it looks like a 70 year old would be driving it | I am ready to trade it in for a BMW 335 something that will acually make me feel under 60 years old | 
 "words": This is my second Cadillac | My first was a 1986 Eldorado which was pure junk | But Cadillac has hit a homerun with the CTS | I also own a Corvette and the CTS is the 4dr version | This car came equipped with the luxury and sport packages | The styling is bold and is recongnizable a mile away | Performance and handling equal the German and Japanese rivals | It's also equipped with OnStar XM and a great navigation system | You need patience to program everything but once done it all works well together | Thanks GM
 "words": The 2 | 8L V6 is OK | XM Radio OnStar great | Imrovement from leatherette to full leather small | 3 | 6 marginally faster | Greatfirst car | Way cooler than Camry Accord

 "words": This is actually my wife's car but I'll tell you we test drove everything | If you want to fit in and not have your car have a personality go buy the Lexus or Acura | This car offers more room than anything in it's class | The others we tested were fine but the CTS has it's own personality and was the best overall ride and drive for us | We tested the 328 G35 IS 350 TL S40 C- and E-Class | Check this car out for it's overall drive | It is a great choice | 
 "words": For the price there are other cars out there that are better equipped | Locking wheel nuts lumbar support theft alarm and rear A C vents are only available as hefty options | My '96 Taurus and '02 Tribute even came stock with most that I mentioned | Yes in other respects this is a fun car to drive | It has plenty of pep gets decent MPG handles very well and has comfortable seating for the most part | Based on this purchase experience first-time Caddy buyer it will be my last | Reason | There is more bang for the buck with the competition |

 "words": Besides test driving the CTS I test drove a Toyota Camry Toyota Avalon Acura TL Infiniti G35 and a Mini Cooper | The Mini Cooper won hands down but I have a wife and two kids | so the Mini didn't win | The CTS won | So why did it win | There was more room in the backseat than in its competitors | which the kids need | I love the exterior of the CTS | I was able to get a 6-speed manual with the CTS | The seats were great | they hugged the body | The interior was not as nice as the TL or the G35 but I just enjoyed the ride of the CTS more than any other car besides the Mini | I got the CTS sport w 18 wheels | I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a new car |
