 "words": Owned a C240 2004 and was time for a change | The dealer showed me several C230 sport sedans and finally chose one with only 12K miles on the clock | The C230 looks elegant and stands out with the AMG pge | Rides like a dream on the highway | Would have liked the Navigation package but will need to upgrade it on the next car | 
 "words": The most beautiful car I have ever owned I was debating between this Mercedes and a BMW 325 but this car just looks 10 times better | The only complaint I have is that it does not have bluetooth mp3 and ipod kit standard even the Scion tc which is a 18k car has the ipod kit and it reads mp3 standard | But other than that it's the best car for the money | Can't wait to get out of work for the drive home | 
 "words": I traded in a 04 Jag xtype on this C230 sport | The car is built so much better it's quiet and soild | The only thing it lacks is a little power | I'm sure the 320 makes up for that | It drives like a much bigger car | The mpg is always 28-29 hwy and 21 city I get avg 26mpg | All the controls are right where they need to be and the storage inside as well as in the trunk is great | There's a tray in trunk over spare that has little trays in it just right for little things | The hillholder 7 speed trans is great as well as the doors that stay open on a grade instead of crushing your legs | It handles very well and corners great | I've owned 120 cars this is in my top 2 1 my crossfire also made by MB

 "words": Despite what other reviewers have said this car has a major Achilles' heel the 7-speed automatic transmission and the small V-6 engine don't get along | By sporty-car standards the 2 | 5-liter engine's 201hp is only marginally adequate | to make this 3400-lb car feel zippy the transmission would really need to downshift quickly and crisply when accelerating | Instead it hesitates and is reluctant to downshift even in sport mode | So what you get is sluggish performance off the line which gradually builds as the rpms go up | Too bad | with different transmission software programming this car could have felt much faster and more responsive | Using the semi-manual feature helps somewhat | 
 "words": This car rocks | It is so much fun to drive and gets to designated speed very quickly | electronics work very well and the entire car in general is very comfortable
 "words": OK this my 2nd C-class had to get away from the simple luxury of the 240 move to an exciting fun to drive cold blk on blk 230 | I love to drive this beautiful machine | Even my wife like to drive my car rather than her new 07 Tahoe | My daughter can't wait until she reaches 16 to drive this car | 30 is the new 20 and I'm enjoying the spoils of this age group | 
 "words": This car is an exceptional vehicle for use to commute to and from work | It has rapid acceleration akin to a high performance sports car with excellent manuverability based upon a 55-45 weigh distribution and low center of gravity | The V6 3 | 0 liter engine is peppy without losing its fuel efficiency at 23-26 mpg | The car is a smaller version of its larger E MB's and the C280 is a joy to drive | 
 "words": I test drove the C280 and the C350 4matic side by side and it was an easy decision to go with the extra power of the c350 | I also drove a 2006 C240 4MATIC and it was clearly underpowered for an all wheel drive car | Especially with all wheel drive I think the extra 40HP between the C280 and C350 make it hard to tell its working all 4 wheels | Wow is this car fun to drive | Paddle shift manual possible to over-ride automatic tranny and when babying the gas it drives like butter | 
 "words": Better quality than previous model years | When sitting in the driver's seat you feel safe and secure | Drives and handles exceptionaly well | Dials and gauges well thought out and positioned in the cabin so you can see them easily |

 "words": Great over all vehicle | Impressive spunk for such a small motor | Excellent fit and finish | Can't beat European automakers | 
 "words": We love the 3 setting memory seats and power head rests with height adjustment on both sides not just driver | The 7 speed auto transmission with 2 reverse gears is very smooth giving 30-31mpg highway at 70-75mph on a cross country trip | The power rear sunshade and excellent climate control just seem to work better than in others cars | Surprisingly more leg room and baby seat room than we expected and more than in several much larger vehicles | Most of all this is just a very quiet very smooth truly luxurious vehicle to drive for miles and miles | 
 "words": You have to drive to appreciate it | Performance comfort luxury style and you name it all in one package | You do not sacrify anything for the sake of sports car | As it is categoriezed luxury sports car | BMW is sports car but not luxury anymore | Needless to say MB performs excellent as a sports car with plenty of luxury and comfort | 
 "words": This car handles well on the road | it can make any turn without any problem | A bit sluggish off the line but picks up in the later gears | I love the 7- speed automatic transmission and the sport-shift concept | Great interior design and it has a classy yet modern looking exterior | Get it with the AMG trim it makes the car standout | A little disappointed in the amount of driver side leg room | I can't find a seat postion that's comfortable | 
 "words": With the all-wheel drive I've had a wonderful winter in a snowy icy part of the U | S | This car just leaves the others spinning around while it deftly handles the road conditions no matter what | The tight turning radius and narrow width enable an easy feel of control and maneuverability that isn't available in higher class cars | Yet the power response sound proofing and feel of solidity blows away the econo boxes of similar size | A great addition for those wanting pinpoint turns control and great handling in any conditions | 
 "words": Even for the least inexpensive model Mercedes this car packs a lot of power and appeal | My family who swears by the Mercedes name are all fans of my little white sport sedan | Although many see the styling as dated I believe Mercedes has retained its signature good looks and performance | Great handling monster sound and impressive acceleration | I'm not an expert obviously but even the biggest car enthusiast I know recommends this car | I'm in love | 
 "words": This car by far outruns the other vehicles in its class | The horsepower that lacks in the beginning compensates at the end | The interior is classy and elegant while the exterior is sporty and eye-catching | The gas mileage is the best you can get for the type of vehicle it is | I'm overall very impressed with my car and even though I leased it with the intent to trade it in for another Mercedes I just might buy this at the end of my lease it's too good to be true | 
 "words": I've owned a lot of German cars from 100K Porsches to 10K used BMW E36's | While generally I stick to BMW Audi this is a very engaging little car | The torque is adequate at low rpms but can be enhanced by utilizing the active automatic as a defacto stick shift | The car is tight and the road feel is excellent | I love the cabin which is sleeek and simple altho' so well insulated that you can be doing 80 and not realize it | As my daily driver I find the car delightful fun to drive and comfortable | I suspect the appeal of this car has something to do with my turning 50 in that comfort is now as important to me as performance | All in all a very engaging little sport sedan | 
 "words": This vehicle is a somewhat marginal improvement over the 2004 model we had owned previously | The additional horsepower is welcomed and clearly evident over the 2004 | The 7 speed transmission also boosted the long distance MPG to a surprising and respectable 31-32 average | If there is one complaint it would be the excessive wind noise eminating from the driver side window | To date all attempts to have the problem rectified have failed | I suppose we will have to just live with the problem until its time to trade again | However this seemingly small defect will certainly impact our decision to buy a Benz in the future | 
 "words": The C280 has a distinctive and elegant appearance unlike any other car in its class | This car feels solid | Very pleasant to drive and extremely responsive | This car makes you want to drive | The C280 is the best car I have ever owned or driven | Period | 
 "words": Great over all vehicle | Impressive spunk for such a small motor | Excellent fit and finish | Can't beat European automakers |
