 "words": as of 10 19 09 I have taken this vehicle to the dealer at least 6 times | it lights up like a christmas tree inside the dash board | check engine light steering wheel tire monitor all stay lit up and dealer can't seem to find the problem | I quess what they say you pay for what you get is true the forenza is cheap and is not worth the aggravation that comes with this car | I would not advise anyone to purchase this car or you will be mad as hell the way that I am | 
 "words": I've had my 2007 suzuki forenza for a year and a half since then3 of my door handles have broke off which i had to pay to replace said they weren't under warranty my transmission is slipping from drive to neutralabout wrecked the other day going into shop on monday paint came off all 4 wheels during a paid car wash they said not under warranty as they said transmission not under warranty as well i bought this car with the feeling of not being broke down for a long time i still owe 9800 on it I have taken extremely good care of my car but it was so cheaply made its unreal I feel suzuki should pay for the replacements of these parts i would never recommand this car toanyone
 "words": I bought this car new | Since then I had to have my passenger door painted | My windshield wipers are rusted my rear view mirror always has a vibration | Also like many others I had a door handle break | Now every time I drive my car looses the gas my car looses speed | Now it has a leak under the engine as well | This is very unsafe and of course they tell my nothing is wrong with my car | Not reliabe and not safe | Worst car ever I will never buy another Suzuki | Don't waste your money no wonder they don't make these cars anymore | 
 "words": I love this car EXCEPT that the door handles have broken 3 times | And the paint on my door handles is peeling off | We bought this 2007 model in 2008 with a new full warranty so the door handles have been replaced for free each time | But it is a pain to schedule and appointment to have it done | Also I feel like the dealership thinks I'm crazy and that I am actually abusing the door handles and breaking them | But I am paying the bill each month and I expect it to work properly | I must say I am very happy with this car- especially the air conditioning speed and gas mileage | I was worth every penny | 
 "words": So bought the car in Aug 2007 first month it was in shop 3 times for a vibration shake | They finally after first aligning rotating and balancing tires then supposedly replaced tires because they claimed there were flat spots figured out it was bent wheel axles | Then again in the shop 3 weeks ago as the engine seemed to have a strain on it and then wouldn't drive | They claimed it was the sensor in the transmission then got it from the dealer and that same day they had to have it towed as it would not shift into gear at all | They told me they replaced the shifter cables | On the first time into the shop for the transmission they told me the radiator was never bolted into the car | 
 "words": I will have to say that despite all of the negative reviews on the gas milleage mine does great | I usually get 25 mpg which is a giant step up from a SUV that only got 16-17 mpg | I mainly drive city too | The car is inexpensive b c that's how it was built | So naturally there are downsides to it | The one I hate the most is the paint wearing out on most everything on the interior | It just would have been better to leave it the grey or tan plastic colors undernear | There is one more thing I don't like whenever I start it up and immediately shift gears it will jump really quick and then will return to normal | Other than the above complaints it's been a great car so far | 
 "words": I bought this car used with 13K miles on it | Now I have 29K and I am really beginning to hate it | In the last year I have replaced 3 door handles 2 sensors for oil pressure and the tachometer just quit working | My overall thought on the car it was a good attempt but it stinks | If you are looking into buying a car like this my best advise to you would be dont buy it | P | S | Tires are ridiculously hard to find and are very expensive | 
 "words": My husband and I purchased our Suzuki Forenza in August 2007 | We have been satisfied with it until about a month ago when two door handles broke off so we took it and had them fixed | At that time for some reason the service tech did not know how to get our car out of gear and a spring was broke in our gear shift | We got that fixed | Now two days ago I was driving to work and the car slipped out of gear by itself and went into neutral | I immediately took it back to the dealer and they put a transmission relay switch | on it | Within the last month I have had the car at the dealer's 3 times | Not very satisfied with this car at this time | Would never buy another one | 
 "words": The interior door handles broke on the front driver and passenger sides | Electrical issues | Occasionally the emergency lights flash when opening the door and will stop when the ignition is turned on | several trips has been made to the dealer but they cannot find the problem | It also causes the AC to randomly blow hot and cold air while in the on position | 
 "words": I have had this car for two years and i have had nothing but bad things to say about it ever since | It was labeled as getting 31 MPG highway estimated | It gets 24 MPG highway | With the fuel costs over the past couple years it almost killed me to drive this car | I had to fill up about every 3 days to get back and forth to work | The inside passenger door handle broke off in my wifes hand a few weeks back | High quality plastic that stuff is | Now the break pedal gets stuck and makes my taillight stay on and drained my battery the other night | The fans inside the engine well came loose when 3 of the four bolts fell out now the hood release wont work either and I cant keep my hood closed | JUNK | 
 "words": Me and my husband bought this car in 2007 and was very satisfy at first | Later our door handles start falling off we took it to the dealer to be repaired and they told us this problem was not under warranty | At this point we are very dissatisfied | 
 "words": I have had both all of the inside door handles break off | I've noticed that those plastic door handles snap very easily during the hot summer months as well as during the winter | 
 "words": I've had my 2007 Forenza for a year now it runs good and gets good gas milage but 2 of my door handles have allready broken off and i treat my car very good both broke on the inside of the car i think that this is a defect in the materials | whats the chance of breaking off two of them | 
 "words": My car has been in the shop many times for the transmission and other defects that could of caused death to me and my daughter I felt I was pushed into the vehicle | These cars are the worst rated vehicle god help you when you purchase say a prayer every time you drive the highway 
 "words": I have a 2007 Forenza With 28000 miles on it | It gets great gas mileage 32 -35 miles a gallon on the road 26-30 in the city | Plenty of power and except for a warranty alternator that went bad the first day I bought it no problems | Great car | Would buy another if they still had them | 
 "words": I like driving this car because it looks good and it's pretty roomy for a sedan | Going from a Corolla to this the extra room is amazing | Perfect for the baby car seat that I have to fit in the back | Not a problem with it so far and it's at about 25000 miles now | The manual shifts great and the speed is suitable enough for a four cylinder | 
 "words": I bought this car for my 60 mile one way commute to work | I only bought it because it was cheap as it was a 2007 I bought in 2008 from a new dealership | At this point I would definitely reccomend this car to anyone | It has decent pickup No race car great highway mileage and has cruise cd MP3 A C and the works | No reliability issues either | I am still a truck guy but for a compact I love my Forenza | 
 "words": I get about 20-25mpg driving about 70 highway 30 city | I guess that's average these days | The acceleration isn't great at least with the automatic transmission | After about 6 months the inside passenger door handle snapped off when my sisterweighs maybe 100 lbs was getting out the car | Sometimes I smell freon when using the AC inside air | Let's hope the warranty covers those | 
 "words": I have had this car for 10 months and put 20000 miles on it | It's very dependable and very spacious in the back seat for my two toddlers I even have room for a third child if needed | The trunk is huge for lots of storage | Sometimes when you go over 85 mph it starts to shimmy a little | The gas mileage is alright not the best but not the worst either | Overall a great car at an affordable price | 
 "words": I needed a car that was reliable and I didn't have to spend a fortune on | While browsing for a few days I came across this car that only had 8500 miles on it for 9980 | One reason for the price drop was they dealer took the stock rims off and replaced them with 15 inch black rims with hubcaps on them | That was alright with me though because I can always replace that | My Forenza is a manual transmission and unlike what other reviews have said on some Forenzas mine accelerates perfectly fine | The one and only complaint so far that I have about this car is that if the tires pressure is not perfect I get a light on in the car because of the TPMS | Overall though good car so far | 
 "words": Ive driven the Forenza now for 6000 miles and the mpg on it the last 3 months has been awful | 12mpg 3 tankfulls in a rowunacceptable and that's city driving | Summer highway driving was ok 27-29 but if I were to buy it again I would get a manual tranny | Ive read it does better on the mpg | Other than that cars been ok | Power is enough for my needs | Just one issue with an engine light had it checked when I went for oil change | 
 "words": Overall this car is a good value for the money | We bought this car on functionality and overall price | We have been fairly pleased | The car performs more or less as promised | Handling is good and power is ok | The mpg has been less than average in the city and better than average on the highway | The car get 15-16 in the city for us but over 30 on the highway | We have had to take the car in 3 times in less than two years | The orginal tires where horrible felt like they were out of balance and this grew worse with time | Two times they checked the balance issue stating it was a tire issue | This has been fixed with different tires | Also we have had a cold idle issue too | 16000 mi | 
 "words": We've had our Forenza for about 9 months now and we are very happy | No problems very comfortable inside and good enough mileage | Of course it's not a performance car but it does better than you would expect from some of the reviews I've read | I would definitely recommend to anyone needing a reliable lower-priced car | 
 "words": My boyfriend and I bought our Suzuki Forenza about a week ago and I love it | Although ours is a 2008 it's still similiar to the 2007 | It's a great vehicle | The exterior design of the car is excellent and the interior has more than enough room | We have two small children and we are both still young ourselves so the exterior and interior fit our needs very well | It's a great vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": Just bought the car and love it | Handles well with lots of get-up-and-go with my 5-speed manual | Really hugs the turns clutch is a little soft though | Still haven't found the sweet spot for 1st keep peeling out on accident if I'm not paying attention -D And the gas mileage is excellent | 
 "words": I thinks this car is a gem | I have never owned a Suzuki before only Mazdas | I think this vehicle is wonderful the acceleration is great | I mean it's not a sports car but it does the job | I also think the safety features are great | So if you are looking for a new car I would recommend this one | And as for the other posts about the gas mileage this car has phenomenal gas mileage | 
 "words": I just purchased my Forenza and love the fact that it's a 5-speed manual | I replaced the factory tires with the rims off my trade-in | Big leap for me from a 92 accord with 347321 miles to a brand new Forenza with 54 miles | Love the car for the price | I looked into a newer model Honda 040506 but they were just as pricey but without the warranty so I chose the Forenza with the warranty | With the way I drive it'll be 10 years before I hit 100000 miles | 
 "words": OK gas mileage but very reliable | Great look and space for my family | Taken two long trips and has been great | Love what I got for the price | Most likely getting another Suzuki for my wife | 
 "words": Pretty decent vehicle for the price | We have a sunroof and a few of the extras and it's a good car | Pretty good fuel consumption compared to my old Ford Taurus and handles pretty well | Find a good deal on it and yeah good | Good visibility on driving only a couple blind spots | Have had only one real problem with the car it didn't start once in P but put it in N in it started | 
 "words": I love my Forenza | I have the '07 black premium package with leather interior and spoiler | I haven't had any problems with it | If you are the type of driver who likes to zig-zag in and out of traffic this car is not for you because the acceleration speed is moderate | I was a little disapointed with the gas mileage at first but I now put mid-grade gas to get better mileage and ride | The good really outweighs the bad | You can't have luxury expectations when driving a economy car | This car is doing just fine for me 
 "words": I have read reviews detailing problems with starting fuel economy etc | This has not been the case for me | Fuel economy is better than EPA est | and the car has been very reliable and comfortable | One of the best cars I have ever purchased | The fit an finish of the car are excellent | 
 "words": Hey I really love this car | I think it's awesome | I have not had any problems with it and I love taking curves fast and driving fast | I only pay 200 a month for it and I put zero down also | It is not a bad car at all | If you go buy one don't forget to ask for the 1000 rebate | It puts the car at less than 14500 for the 2007 model | If you find a 2006 model you can get it for 13500 | I read the complaints that some have about the resale value | Well you just bought a new car you can't expect to resell it for more | it's not house | The best thing to do is just hold on to it and have fun with it hey it does have a great warranty and it looks really good | 
 "words": It's hard to find a company that isn't discontinuing its wagons in favor of some kind of crossover thing | Suzuki still proudly offers them and I was pleasantly surprised with the price standard features and styling | 
 "words": So far I have had no problems with this car | Its drive is very smooth and comfortable | 
 "words": My '07 Forenza only starts when it wants to the check engine light comes on all the time and it has a very bad trade in value | Say no to Suzuki | 
 "words": This car looks quite nice from the outside | It also comes standard with air conditioning a CD player and heated mirrors | However I have had multiple starting problems with this car even though my Suzuki dealer claims this problem is limited to the '06 models | It also gets bad gas mileage when compared to other compact cars | I was driving a SUV so I did not notice it at first but 21 mpg for a compact is bad | Also the automatic transmission sucks too much power away from the already small inefficient engine | When I am going up a hill on the interstate I have to keep my foot on the floor and still lose speed | The engine is also quite noisy and does not like to go above 60 mph | Do not buy this car | 
 "words": I purchased this car on Halloween and I love it | It rides really well it's fast and fun to drive | I love the gas mileage I get especially since gas seems to be going up again | It has ample leg room and a roomy trunk | It's great |
