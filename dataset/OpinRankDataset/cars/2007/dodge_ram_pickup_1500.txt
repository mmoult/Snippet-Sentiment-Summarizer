REVIEWS
 "words": I have had this truck for two years with no issues | I have a 6 lift 35 tires magnaflo exhaust airaid intake and throttle body spacer and I pull a 7x14 enclosed trailer loaded with toys and I get about 14-15 mpg that is going up many big hills and going about 65 | I didn't buy this truck for gas mileage I bought it to play with and tow with great choice | at least my dodge doesn't have spark plug issues | 5 | 4Lany guesses | 
 "words": I traded my 2005 Dodge SLT 4x4 in on a Cadillac for my Wife and regretted doing so as I missed it so much so I bought the 2007 when I had the opportunity | It is a 2007 SLT Sport 4x4 with the Hemi and it is a fantastic truck | It sits outside day and night in uncovered parking in the hot Arizona Sun and it has never let me down doesn't over-heat and the truck still looks like Brand New | The Arizona Heat can cook an interior but so far nothing has warped nor faded | Now mileage totally stinks and it gets worse mileage with the 8 4 Engine than the V-8 Hemi did in my 2005 and gets roughly the same mileage as my 1973 Dodge Powerwagon did with a 360 | It averages only 12 MPG which stinks | 
 "words": Before I bought this truck I read every one of these reviews | Now after owning it for a few months I'm surprised they were so positive | I thought I'd add my 2 cents | Put simply if you buy a truck to use a truck | Avoid this one | I tow and use my truck alot off road | Build quality is extremely flimsy | Tranny has very irritating and weird shifting tendencies | Road wander is horrible in this thing | The slightest little bump will send it bouncing all over the road | If you just go to and from work and Home Depot on the weekends and don't mind the bouncing into the next lane when you hit a bump | This truck is for you | 
 "words": Never had any issues with the truck | Truck came with the 20 inch wheels which is what I liked | It also came with the Hemi motor and its really response when the pedal is floored | The Hemi is sensitive on the brands of gas so its best to use a popular brand | 
 "words": For the most part I really love this truck | Awesome looks and can't beat the power of the hemi | But it is headed to shop for the fourth time for leak in back window | When it rains the storage buckets under the back seats will have water in them | Can't seem to get it stopped | Also truck comes out of reverse occasionally | Doesn't happen on a daily basis but just enough to worry me | Thank goodness I have the lifetime warranty on the powertrain so that it will be covered if it gets any worse | Really hope they can get the leak fixed because I love my truck and don't want to have to end up trading it due to one issue | 
 "words": Great truck so far | Very dependable with respectable power from the little 4 | 7 but horrible gas mileage | I don't drive it too hard and have never got much higher than 15 mpg even on the highway | I think it drives pretty smooth for such a big truck | The best part to me is the look it has | Mine has the chrome 2o's and i think it looks better and tougher than any other | I would recommend this truck to anyone | 
 "words": I have to say overall I love my truck | It's not perfect though | The gas mileage has never really improved that much the driver door doesn't seal very well and at highway speed there is a lot of wind noise | I have a leak from the front probably by the looks of it the front trans axle which is going for service next week the Hemi engine when driving at highway speeds and switches to 4 cylinders will cause wheel spin on ice black ice | This is a major problem for those of us north of the border in the winter | I also pull a 29' camper trailer with my truck and I wish I upgraded to the 2500 when I purchased my truck 2 years ago | Overall I am happy but I will consider a Ford next time | 
 "words": Overall I have enjoyed this vehicle | But I am having a ton of problems with the tailgate | It is really hard to close at times or it won't even stay shut | 
 "words": We have owned GM vehicles always and we were looking for a good lease deal | Dodge was the greatest | We hesitated getting Dodge because what some people say but that truck had such an extreme hard life and never left us stranded | Never any transmission problems or anything | Up huge hills with 5 snowmobiles on the back of a trailer to the rug burnout competitions snowmobile trails you name it and it did it | It went awesome but the lease is now up | At 33k it still goes like new | 
 "words": Truck ran fine until it hit 2500 miles then it was a check engine light after getting truck back from dealer all warning lights would come on at the same time when the temperature got over 95 degrees outside and the truck would start cutting out and would not start on occasion | After being left stranded three times and no fix from Dodge we took a loss and traded it | Might have had better luck at a different dealer service department | 
 "words": First off I must mention this truck has the old model 4 | 7L motor and not a Hemi or the 250HP 4 | 7L that came out later in 2007 | The truck has been fun to drive aside from being a bit underpowered on the freeway | I have used the 4x4 on weekend excursions and the truck is plenty comfortable for longer vacations | 
 "words": This is by far the best truck I've driven or rode in | The 5 | 7 has nothing but power | Fuel economy around 18 on hwy at 65 | Around 14 in city | The backseat is huge | I have a friend that's 6'4 and has plenty of leg room | The heated leather seats and sound system are awesome | I have no complaints | Compliments everywhere I go | I | Bought with intentions of a family vehicle and it will serve great for that and work | The rear room is more than any SUV or car | By far the best vehicle I've ever had | 
 "words": I've only had it for about 2 months so far but it is truly awesome | I got the ThunderRoad edition which as best as I can tell included bigger better tires rims better stereo speakers and nerf step up bars | The ride is quite smooth and the interior is very comfortable | Obviously the mileage isn't peak but it's a V8 truck for heavens sake so that really shouldn't be a complaint for any owner that said however I've averaged about 18 | 5 mpg so far and even have a cellphone snapshot of it hitting 21 | 1 mpg at one point all highway driving obviously but 21 | 1 in a V8 pickup truck | awesome | 
 "words": Overall this truck has been excellent for the money | My 07 4 | 7L Ram 4X4 has plenty of space and offers a very comfortable ride | Have had no problems except for with the 4WD system | I have 25K and have already had a problem with the front drive axles slipping off the front diff splines making it very difficult to drive in the snow | As of yet no word on whether Dodge will fix it under warranty | Transmission does shift difficult at times but other then that excellent mpg | ranging anywhere from 12-22MPG depending on city or freeway driving | 
 "words": I've always been a muscle car guy | When I test drove my 5 | 7 Hemi Big Horn Edition i enjoyed having that power on demand | This truck was the best value for the buck | Hands down | Plus the lifetime warranty is unmatched | I've had the truck for over a year now and have not had a single problem | Great for Hauling my muscle cars around | Actually gets better fuel economy while towing on the hwy | This is my first truck and what an amazing truck it is | 
 "words": I own the 07 Ram 1500 SLT Quad Cab with the 4 | 7 V8 automatic | About every 2-3 months there's always something crapping out in it | Off the lot it had a module bad that wouldn't allow the keys to program | Starting issues that are still not resolved because it wont duplicate when the techs are looking at it | Both fog lights broke | They fixed that | About 3 months later check engine light | Some canister failed | Took 2 weeks to fix that | 9 Month mark trucks starts to pull | They replaced a bushing | Took 2wks for that still pulling | They aligned my truck to a faulty machine | they admitted their machine was bad and got that fixed | Radiator fan will grind under heavy stress and engine temps | 
 "words": This is my first Dodge | I love the truck but will not be able to keep it after warranty | The engine light comes on with regularity | Luckily warranty has covered the new computer all the code checks leaking shock wind noise adjustments | Warranty has not covered my TIME to bring the truck in and wait | If Dodge could fix this issue I would love the truck but will not be able to afford it after the warranty | My advice lease one | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Dodge Ram and I purchase the 2007 5 | 7 hemi | The engine gets great gas mileage compared to the 4 | 7 | On a flat highway going 55 to 60 mph this truck clocks 30 to 31 miles per gallon | 
 "words": Nice truck mpg is better than my Ford Ranger that I traded The 4 | 7 engine looks to be well designed and has plenty of power Transmission seems to have a mind of its own shifts are inconsistent and jerky at times but if it becomes a bigger issue I always have the peace of mind of the lifetime powertrain warranty
 "words": I have owned 5 Dodge Rams and this is the best one yet | The ride handling reliability and comfort are unsurpassed | This is the only half-ton truck to offer ESP | What a life saver | ESP has saved me many times this winter driving down narrow country roads | The seats are a perfect fit | The rack and pinion steering makes the truck fun and nimble | I have had no trouble at all | 
 "words": This is by far the best pick-up on the road | Laramie mega-cab has by far the most comfortable rear seat in the business | The nav is straightforward and easy to use | 5 | 7 hemi has incredible power when you need it | With 8500 miles so far I average 16 | 5 hwy at 80 mph | The only bad news is 12 | 5 city | But I love this truck and so for knock on fake wood not a single problem |

 "words": Bought this truck after looking at the Chevy Ford Nissan and even the Toyota | Out of all the other trucks this one had the most features and room and was cheaper than the rest | Also if we live in America we should drive an American truck right | Suppot the local economy | 
 "words": Drives excellent smooth quiet snappy throttle | tripped from NH to NC and back again and averaged 25 | 9 mpg with the 4 | 7 Magnum engine that's not a typing mistake
 "words": Poor performance and 4x4 weak 19000 miles and transfer case went south very poorly designed transfer case 48000 sticker price paid 38000 new and less than 6 months later dealers only want to give 19000 trade in fuel mileage on hemi is pathetic 10 | 9 to 11 mpg this is the worst car buying experience I have ever had and that most money I have ever lost on a vehicle through depreciation come on Chrysler | We are at record high fuel prices inflation killing everyone's wallet and this is what you do for your customers | Thats crap | I Dodge thinks they have owner loyalty because people keep their dodges a long time but that is because when you buy a Dodge you owe way to much to sell 
 "words": This is a great truck so far | I was immediately attracted to the truck's appearance but when I drove it I was very pleased with the ride and comfort | Nice quiet ride | I previously owned a Jeep Wrangler and needed more room and more cargo space | The truck works quite well with our Child Seat and the occasional trip to Lowe's | I purchased the truck with the 4 | 7l V-8 | It's a good engine for getting around the back roads where I live | I don't do much towing although I did pull an enclosed trailer with ease | I also really like the simple and functional interior | I was raised on GMC's so purchasing my Dodge was a risk but so far I am very happy with my choice | 
 "words": I love my truck | It's so smooth and quiet and handles like a car compared to old trucks | The build quality is amazing I had given up on American automobiles and had sworn by Japanese cars when it came to quality and affordability but Dodge has changed my mind with this truck its built every bit as good as a Honda and is much more enjoyable to drive |
