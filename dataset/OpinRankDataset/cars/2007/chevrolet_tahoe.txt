REVIEWS
 "words": I must accept that at the beginning I was a little concern about the reliability of this truck due his history but I have to say after almost 3 years to own it that this is the best truck I've ever had | No complaints at all | Just visits to dealership for regular maintenance and for a 5 | 8 V8 engine 17 miles gal | is not bad | 
 "words": Bought our Z71 Tahoe as soon as they went on sale | Still very pleased with the looks of the vehicle but it seems like Chevrolet skimped on the interior quality lots of hard plastics everywhere and cheap leather | However it has held up pretty well other than a jerking rear end upon take off and squeaky door panels | Current mileage is 61K lets hope it continues to hold up | Had the Traverse been on sale when I purchased I probably would have gotten that instead | 
 "words": Bought our first Chevy new LTZ Tahoe | Love the looks and ride of the vehicle | Have had problems with the rear end | It actually FELL OUT | Thank goodness it was still under warranty | still have problems with the rear jerking when stopping at a light or stop sign and when taking off | The rear end smells like it is burning after driving it for about 45 minutes | Resale value is about what we still owe on the Chevy | Gonna sell or trade it I think | Keep taking it to shop and they can't find anything else wrong with it since completely rebuilding the rear end | Oh well | NO MORE CHEVY'S FOR US | 
 "words": The first 36000 miles of my first big american suv ownership were great | Now that I'm out of the warranty period I can understand why people who haven't been down this path before get easily burned by some american auto products | However I've now had the rotors turned at 38000 miles and the other day I had to replace the entire power steering assembly 900 | I tried reasoning with the service manager that this was way too early to do for such a new car | I can't blame him for the problem he didn't tell me to buy the car he's just telling me how to fix it | Very frustrating | 
 "words": Bot it while I owned a restaurant and had 3 grandchildren near by | Now that we have closed the rest and live in the city we look like aliens driving this will all of the hondas and bmws | Great highway car very safe in the mountains and in the snow | Hard to park in a parking garage which is what I have to do now | 
 "words": My 2007 Tahoe is a joy to drive | It's extremely comfortable for both the driver and passengers | Lots of cargo space and the flexibility of adding the 3rd row seats | It's a big SUV not purchased for its fuel economy but I still beat the 16mpg rating even with most of my driving in town for less than 8 miles per trip | 
 "words": I've had my 2007 Chevy Tahoe LT3 about 2 | 5 years now | It's been holding up really well so far | It still looks good and the interior has 
 "words": I traded an 03 Z71 4X4 Tahoe for an 07 LT | It took me almost a year to find the exact options and colors that I was looking for | Already replaced the struts on rear hatch and instrument cluster under warranty or it would have been traded | Local dealer has been wonderful | Interior is not going to hold up | The gas mileage is ridiculously overrated | I drive all hwy with 1 stop sign and easy driving and only average 17 on a good day finally got 19 on interstate | Was mislead my Chevy reports | Awful resell value | This truck is awesome to look at and nice to drive but I can tell there is no way it will hold up like my last one | Die hard Chevy person but probably not for long
 "words": I like the size of the interior but ergonomically this vehicle is challenged | Keep hitting the 4 wheel drive knob with my knee getting out | No creature comforts such as change holder sunglass storage etc | It holds everything I can pack into it | Had the dead battery issue | Had battery changed at my expense because the dealer said it was good | No more battery issue | I have 70000 miles and get 17 MPG | The way to do it is coast on every downhill stretch of road even the short ones | Coast to every red light | Need tires now | Had uneven tire wear but got 70000 via frequent rotation | So far no mechanical problems | The seals are poor and the ride is loud as everyone else has said | 
 "words": Truck drives like a car | It gets 18-20 mpg on the hwy with ease | Drive in town and you can expect 15 | All around truck rides and drives great | Gets the best MPG of all the big trucks and SUVs and looks the best | GM did a great job on the style of this truck | Hopefully the long term reliability is going to be there | 
 "words": I've driven many luxury cars and trucks with greater names than the Tahoe but this truck ranks among them for comfort and design | It's a not so poor man's Escalade | 
 "words": I have to work hard to find faults with this vehicle | Many reviews complain about the mileage but even the EPA has revised the rating system to better reflect reality | The mileage is slightly better than any other vehicle in its class | The interior styling and comfort is vastly improved over previous models I traded in a 2001 Tahoe | Acceleration is adequate and responsive | The transmission has a moderate shift shock when accelerating after applying the brakes | For those who plan to tow be aware that the hitch reciever is considerably higher than most vehicles I had to buy a new hitch with a lower drop | Overall I am very pleased with the vehicle and would recommend it to anyone | 
 "words": I just returned from a 2000 mile trip in 6 days | It is a great suv
 "words": I love this Bermuda Blue Tahoe | I took it on a 400 mile road trip and it drove like a luxury car | On the return trip I averaged 20 mpg staying under 65 mph | I have no complaints and only praise for GM | This is a fantastic well-designed go anywhere vehicle | It's a pleasure to drive | 
 "words": The factory running boards are dangerous | I have had two people fall while getting out of my vehicle | They seem to become slippery and don't have a good amount of traction to them | This should be reported to GM and corrected | I also don't like the exterior door handles | My driver door handle seems to stick in the out position when closing or opening | I am a tall guy and when I get in I often hit my knee on the dial that controls the lights on the left side below the steering wheel | This should be better placed | 
 "words": A very robust design | Easy to do maintenance in | Besides their 100000 mile warranty is a big plus | 
 "words": From the day I got my Tahoe the 1st month it had been in the shop 3 times for the dashboard popping up | The little things such as sometimes the window won't go down doors won't unlock when I want them to other things like when airconditoning is on it makes a high pitched squeal but yet it only does it once in a while and the won't fix it because its not happening at the time I bring it in | But the part that really stunk 6 months after buying it it got stuck in FWD and I put it neutral to get it out but that wasn't working so I got stuck on the side of the road for over an hour till the dealership picked me up | When you buy a new car it should be reliable | 
 "words": This has got to be the best vehicle I have ever bought | I usually drive German cars | It is a far cry from what they used to be | It is just amazing | Plenty of power to pull my boat and still getting 22 hwy and 20 with the boat | Thank you Chevy I love you guys
 "words": The rear end makes a lot of noise | Make sure you don't get one that does | I have drove two that make niose so it is very popular problem | Test drive for a least two days to make sure you don't have lemon | 
 "words": I have the LTZ 4X4 overall a great truck | Looks are outstanding and the interior is very refined | Engine sounds nice | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle new from the lot | The window moldings kept popping off a defect which was confirmed by the dealer | The front seat is too small for me I am 5'10 | It is made for soccer moms | The pedals are too close to the seat and the steering wheel is not telescopic | Adjustable pedals won't push them back | The plastic on the sideview mirrors was separating and the battery died twice | I did not leave any lights on |

 "words": I love this Tahoe | I went from a Toyota Camry to this in April '06 | I thought that the Tahoe would be a gas hog but I was wrong | I only use about 60-80 more a month due to a lot of city driving but the comfort and safety is worth it | My insurance was only 30 more a year and it rides so much smoother then the Camry | I would not trade it in for anything | I have two kids and they love it | So much room for them and their friends | We just got the LS and it has everything that we need for our family | I could not ask for more for the price | 
 "words": Excellent acceleration | Smooth ride | Extremely comfortable and better fuel economy than previous models | I got every option possible and they all work flawlessly | Fantastic vehicle | 
 "words": The fit and finish of the '07 Tahoe is fantastic | The improved fuel efficiency is nice but not all that noticiable | This truck performs like a much smaller car | If we were to go back six months we would still have chosen to purchase the 2007 Tahoe | 
 "words": Kudos to GM | I cannot be happier with this vehicle | I've avoided US auto makers over last 10 years and only took a look at the Tahoe after we had our third child | The Tahoe is quiet | The fit and finish is unbelievable and it rides like a luxury car | We took a 12 hour road trip and it was extremely comfortable | 
 "words": Had a 2000 YUKON and really hated to give it up but I could not pass up the deal they made me and I am so happy with my 2007 | The ride is softer the room is bigger and the mileage is better with the 5 | 3 DOD | Many more features than 2000 | 
 "words": My 2007 Tahoe was one of the 1st to be released and I have had multiple problems with DVD rear view mirror door molding power locks and folding seats | But main issue is with the poor reception of the FM XM radio | I have had the Tahoe serviced 3 times for the radio and they cannot fix the problem it may be the poor placement and engineering of the FM XM antenna in the rear back glass | Radio fades in and out when passing by power lines trees building drive-thru windows | Very irritating especially when I paid more for the premium Bose system | 
 "words": We recently purchased the Tahoe LTZ | I must say that we were drawn to the Tahoe by the new styling and estimated fuel economy | The Tahoe is a very comfortable and quite ride and the LTZ has all kinds of bells and whistles | I just hope that after the 3yr warranty is up that all the electronic bells and whistles don't start to malfunction | The fuel economy is a little misleading | Were getting 12- 13mpg around the city and 15-16mpg on the highway | Other than that we are very pleased with our first Chevy purchase | 
 "words": This is the first SUV I've owned but I do have a '01 Silverado truck and use an '05 Yukon company vehicle | I love this Tahoe | It has very comfy seats and rides like a cruiser not a truck | I love the new exterior design and the dash interior is very appealing | I've had a little bit of trouble getting the inside temp to feel regulated seem to feel a draft on my left leg while driving but controls are still very new to me | I wish I had the auto fold side view mirrors probably only because I'm still taking it to the car wash a lot | Not many vehicles I've ever been extremely excited about but so far so good on this one | 
 "words": Loaded LTZ for MSRP of 53k for 46k What a steal for all of the options you get in this SUV | Interior is beautiful now that they added the wood look to the middle console supurb stereo comfortable large seats gadgets galore and everything you could want in a SUV especially for this price | 35 radio presets XM AM FM and you can scan on steering wheel without changing bands | I love that feature | Great navigation display
 "words": My most recent car was a Mercedes and my wife has a BMW | The drive quality is much better with the Tahoe | It is solid with zero rattles and a powerful engine | The interior is luxurious and passengers feel like they are sitting in first class aboard a 747 | The Tahoe looks much better than the competition and truly stands out as most cars look the same these days 
 "words": My overall review of the car is favorable | However the design of the dashboard is flawed | The instrument panel lighting is horrible | During daytime there is no light to view the instrument panel | You cannot read the panel easily | Also I would think for the cost the remote access control would be a learning remote that remembers each respective seat setting | It goes back to neutral each time so if you don't press your pre-set seating requirements each time mirrors and seat have to be readjusted | Navigation system is not passenger-use friendly | You can't use it while moving a feature that would be nice | I understand why the driver shouldn't use it while driving but what about the co-pilot | 
 "words": After one month I am extremely pleased with the LTZ model | Power lift gate has been a pleasure when hands are full with stuff | 
 "words": Great handling quiet interior | Navigation is a plus | The third row seat is pointless since it gives you almost zero storage behind them | Fuel economy is fair at 16mpg avg after 10000 miles | Drives great on a long trip and feels just as at home on the beach | LTZ pkg is the way to go | Just do some homework before you buy | You can search local GM dealers inventory online and then request a price via internet | Right off the bat you'll save 10 off MSRP | This car is not your old Suburban | It's been completely redone | 
 "words": I love this vehicle | I only wish I would have gotten the LT3 for the 12 way power seat and the power lift gate | But he LT2 is more then I expected | Mileage leaves a bit to be desired but I noticed as it breaks in it is getting a bit better | 
 "words": This is our first new vehicle and we are very impressed | Its nine seats are perfect for hauling everyone around | 
 "words": First off I traded in a Honda Pilot | It was my 11th Honda | I wanted a little bigger vehicle and looked at the Toyota GMC Yukon Denali and even the Escalade | I never even considered Chevy until I drove one | It rides great and is very quiet luxury car quiet | I'm impressed by the fit and finish on par with the Japanese imports | 
 "words": Loved this SUV until the rack pinion drive gear started to leak oil at 2000 miles | Dealer fixed it | Then at 5000 miles transmission leaked oil | My ride is still in the shop today | Very disappointed with GM | No wonder we cannot compete with foreign car makers |

 "words": After 32 years of driving this is the first new vehicle my wife or I have purchased | Our previous 1985 Chevy Suburban 7 | 4L with over 316000 miles is getting tired but still going | However the opportunity fell in out lap for a great deal on an '07 Tahoe and one test drive is all it took to make our first ever new purchase | Although my strong ties to the Chevy brand which I have been driving since 16 OK 15 but don't tell anyone I think finding a better value is not possible | Comparing to other SUV's in it's class there is no competition | Sure one could pay a zillion dollars for a Mercedes SUV but for the average Joe or even the upper crust the new '07 is hard to beat | 
 "words": I love my Tahoe especially now that we have added 22 rims and Billet Grille Bowtie | We tinted the front windows and customized our plates and it's wicked | The only thing I regret is not getting leather | We live in the Valley in CA and black leather would be too hot but the new fabric interior is awful | Everything sticks to it | We have tried fabric softener sheets and sprays | We constantly get it cleaned and are still using a lint roller to clean the fuzz that sticks to it | Only complaint | 
 "words": Quiet ride very smooth handling | Great on long trips | Gas mileage improved to 22 mpg on hwy and about 12-13 in the city | 
 "words": I traded a 2005 Toyota Sequoia on this 2007 Tahoe | My new Tahoe has it all over the Sequoia | Many more features plus lower price | As an added bonus my warranty has now been extended to 5yrs and 100000 miles better than Toyota's | Sticker on the 2005 Toyota was 49735 more than 3000 over the Tahoe and with fewer features | I love the Tahoe and so far no problems with 2783 miles and average 20 | 7 MPG

 "words": I love it | It is a car that fullfills all of my needs | I can take my two lab pups the kids and their friends and still go to dinner in style and comfort with my husband | 
 "words": We traded in an '04 Tahoe So far the gas mileage seems to be about 3 miles per gal better hwy city combined | Have not taken it on a long trip yet the engine switchs from 4 8 cylinders with no effort | The ride is like a car handling and parking very easy to manuver | The radio with the fav pages makes it easy to switch to your favorite stations | Absolutely love the new Tahoe | GM did a great job | 
 "words": We picked up our Tahoe just prior to a trip with the kids to the beach | We were able to put its practicality to use right away | The new styling is very fresh and we received a lot of looks as we were driving | The 4 cyl 8 cyl technology helped us get 19 miles per gallon even though much of our traveling was through the WV and VA mountains | We opted for the second row buckets and the rear entertainment system | The kids love it | Interior is very roomy with nice conveniences | Ride is great too | We have since had the opportunity to tow a boat and the Tahoe pulls very well | Only knock thus far is a pesky vibration where the headliner and interior trim meet the driver door | 
 "words": I've owned my first Tahoe 07 LT and the whole family loves it | I got the captain's chairs for the second row so kids can climb in and out to the third row seat as well real easy | The entertainment DVD system is a big hit with the kids they don't want to get out of the car | The drive is especially nice and is one of the nicest SUV's I looked at | You get your bang for your buck with this car | Mileage is still breaking in and is running low but I hear that is typical with any new car | I am going to try and run under 3500 rpm as a previous reader indicated | Only downfall is child safety windows for second row seat | They only go 1 2 way down | Once you drive it you'll buy it |

 "words": This is an excellent vehicle | I use it to tow a boat and it does so with ease | it even tows in 4-cylinder mode | My fuel economy is great I get 24-25 highway and 17 city | the trick is not to accelerate quickly and try to keep under 3500 rpm Interior fit and finish is a huge step for GM though nothing compared to BMW but still is an interior worth buying | The exterior is beautiful and visibility is improved greatly | It doesen't feel as big as it is when driving | Overall an excellent vehicle | Don't buy any oter SUV | 
 "words": I've owned 2 other Tahoes and by far this is the best of the others | Great exterior design NICE improvement on interior quality Nice Bose system and XM radio | The exterior finish is the best by far of my other GM products | Ford look out | This is Quality One | 
 "words": I purchased the 2WD LTZ approx 2 weeks ago | This is the first Tahoe I have ever owned | I frequently trade cars and have had several SUV's | In the past 6yrs I have had a Yukon Yukon XL and a Denali | This vehicle is light years ahead of any I have ever owned | It makes the inside of a Denali look like it came out of the 70's | The interior is roomy seats are very comfortable | Handling is great for such a large vehicle and the ride is very smooth | The fuel management feature of shutting down half the engine is an excellent idea | Cant even feel when it happens | I wish I could drive it more but I can't seem to get my wife out of it | Won't be trading this one anytime soon it's a keeper | 
 "words": Mileage rating and drop back to 4 cylinder performance is a joke | My own SUV which is the LTZ and is fully loaded had a faulty climate control system and one speaker which didn't work from the start | The windshield has a scratch in the middle of it | The rear hatch had continuous squeaks in it which the dealer corrected | The dash still has a constant squeak in it which I don't know whether or not will ever be found | The polished aluminum wheels and their quality are a joke for the price that GM charges considering a set of four high end chrome American Racing Rims would cost much less | The spare tire is a different brand than the four driving tires which is another waste of money | 
 "words": Overall thrilled by quality of the 2007 Tahoe | Leased LT1 w dealer installed leather | Feels and drives great | Just took 500 mile ride back and forth to VT | Never so comfortable in a car | Quiet smooth w excellent sound system | Much more for the money than Volvo XC 70 we traded in | However don't be fooled about gas mileage | Although almost 19 MPG on highway cruise control at 65 mph through mtn's appx 13 mpg around town | Can't think just MPG | Must think MPG per passenger | 
 "words": Having had a couple Tahoes this one by far is the best of them all | The looks quality are far and above any SUV I've owned |

 "words": This vehicle is a pleasure to drive | It is so quiet and comfortable you'd think you were in your livingroom | The sound system is fantictic | Great Job G M | 
 "words": This is one of several Tahoes I have owned I have vibration in steering wheel and bumpy ride came with Bridgestone tires the dealer has replaced the tires and seems to have solved the problem | I like everything about the 2007 Tahoe except I think better tires should come on the Tahoe | 
 "words": The hype about the engine dropping out 4 cylinders to conserve fuel clearly suggests to the buyer that the shift would occur when the car reached highyway crusing speed | In fact it only reduces to 4 cylinders when one lets up on the accelerator | Therefore in a 500 mile trip the car gives you the last 50 yardsas you stop in the 4 cylinder mode
 "words": This is the best vehicle i've ever owned | It's got a great ride and quiet interior but still can tow and haul | The ext | and int | fit and finish is perfect | I have had 0 problems | One last thing the styling is great | Everywhere I go friends and family want to check it out |

 "words": This is my second large SUV having traded a first-gen Ford Expedition for my Tahoe LT 4x4 | Where the Tahoe trumps the Expedition is overall refinement offering a smoother more supple ride better sound isolation and incrementally better handling | The 1950's Chris-Craft bass exhaust burble is entertaining but never obtrusive and hints at the burly but refined nature of what's under the hood | The instrument panel and switchgear appears to be a lift from a late-model Audi which is just fine by me | Negatives Too heavy for its size and a 26-gallon tank is just too small particularly if you plan to tow with this vehicle | The Expedition had a 30- gallon tank which was just right | 
 "words": This is the first vehicle both my wife and I have purchased in 10 years | First mistake was purchasing this Chevy | We had leased 7 new vehicles prior to this purchase | This way if we had a problem or just didn't like the vehicle we could turn it in a few years later | I have recently made my second payment on this vehicle and the car is dead | No one at Chevy knows why and no one can give us an answer | They have had this vehicle for 10 days now | The vehicle still will not start | All they can tell us is the engine has no power when turning the key | This is my wife's new vehicle and we have 3 small children | We depend on this vehicle which had left us stranded an hour and a half from home | 
 "words": Great overall SUV | Exterior styling is sharp | Turns a lot of heads and I get a lot of comments | Interior redesign is where this SUV shines | The look and layout is nicer than my Lexus though the dash materials aren't quite as soft | The handling power ride and just overall driving experience is second to none for an SUV | I like the front end better than the Yukon otherwise pretty much exactly the same SUV | Also why pay 20K more for an Escalade when it's also basically the same SUV | I looked at Toyota Sequoia Ford Expedition Navigator Lexus GX and Toyota 4Runner and the Nissan Armada when looking | The Tahoe just simply is better in so many ways | Great job GM | 
 "words": I have owned the 2007 Tahoe for a month now | The looks of the Tahoe sold me plus the idea of another child | I love driving the SUV | It is smooth powerful and drives nicely | not like a truck | Does anyone else get the Wind whistle noise around the driver side mirrors at highway speeds | It's annoying | 
 "words": I really like my 2007 Tahoe but it has some problems | I cannot get it to stop the engine light from coming on when I use e-85 | Also the traction light keeps coming on and they cannot find out what to do with these problemsthey are working on it but I have lose 7 days driving time already | 
 "words": I did about 2 months worth of research to find the right car and I ended up picking the '07 Tahoe before I even test drove anything else | The thing I love the most that I didn't see in any review before I bought it was the super tight turning circle that this behemoth has | I was blown away | This thing turns like a sports coupe | Not sure how they did it but I am super impressed | Also riding in this thing is like riding on my recliner at home it's super-comfortable | I love all the neat techno gadgets in this car and I love being so high up on the road | This car was not cheap I got a great deal because of all the research I did and the fact that I had a walk away attitude | Cheers | 
 "words": The last 6 vehicles we have purchased has been new and almost all of them have had close to acurate gas mileage claims when purchased however the 2007 Tahoe that we have is no where close | With an advertised 21mpg we are experiencing 13 | 5mpg highway after 4000 miles | Our dealer is side steping every question we have and trying to stall us telling us we will not see the 20mpg range until the vehicle has 15000 miles on it | We purchased the Tahoe because we were only getting 12 | 5mpg in our Hummer H2 and wanted a better gas mileage vehicle | We feel that we have been mislead | 
 "words": I have owned the 2007 Tahoe for a couple of weeks now and am amazed at the performance this vehicle has | I drive long distances and this has the features and design that let you actually enjoy driving again | Don't buy this SUV I want to be the only one driving this beautiful machine | 
 "words": I traded in a Trailblazer for the new Tahoe | The truck drives better than the Expedition Armada and Sequioa that I drove | The interior is just as comfortable as every other Chevrolet but it looks much better | On the highway the ride is quiet and comfortable | Off road performance is great with the locking back end and autotrac but be sure to remove the front air-dam before going on extreme outings | If you have a boat then the G80 differential option is a must | I got 2500 off the sticker price | I am getting 19mpg mixed with the 5 | 3L- not bad considering the size and towing capacity | Gas mileage is better than most mid-sized SUVs and all full sizers
 "words": Still new but I love this truck | Looks great runs great performs great | Only complaint I have so far is the height of the hitch receiver | 
 "words": Still new but I love this truck | Looks great runs great performs great | Only complaint I have so far is the height of the hitch receiver |

 "words": We bought this vehicle with the belief that it would be a solid vehicle that would meet the rigors of driving in the Colorado high country | It has far surpassed our expectations in comfort in gas mileage 18 | 5 MPH during mountain driving and in compelling add-ons | The only negative is the non-flat 3rd seat area | 
 "words": I traded my '04 Suburban LT 4x4 last week for the LTZ 4x4 and there is NO COMPARISON | GM got it right | the Tahoe is awesome | My first tank of gas in stop and go traffic in Dallas netted 17 | 3 mpg | what a pleasure vs | the 13 mpg on the Suburban | Like everyone else my only knock is the rear cargo area | The permanent tracks for the 3rd row seats are a bit annoying when the seats are removed but there are MANY more features that overshadow this minor issue | Great SUV | Rides like a luxury car |
