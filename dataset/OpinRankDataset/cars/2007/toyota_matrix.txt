REVIEWS
 "words": Just purchased a 2007 base model w 5- spd the M Theory package and 36000 miles | Right off the bat got 31 MPG cruising at 77 MPH w AC on intermittently | Then cruising at 71 MPH on the way back w AC on full time got 35 MPG | So far I like the way it handles the power is acceptable but not sports car fun but most importantly it a very useful car parking cargo cost | M Theory is purely for looks bright color but not worth extra for most | 
 "words": Bought this Matrix used with only 8K and the original warranty traded in my turbo 07 Forester which required premium gas and got 22mpg when premium went to 4 | 50 gallon | Computed the mpg on the Matrix with the first fill-up got 36mpg | I cried | I love this car | I consistently get 32-36 mpg combined | Miss the sunroof and AWD of the Forester but got such a deal on the Matrix bought snow tires and traction now as good as AWD | 
 "words": I traded in a Subaru for the Matrix and I miss the power | The Toyota is a nice solid car and fits a dog well lots of storage very comfortable driving and comfortable for four adults | The center console is messy and doesn't fit a coffee cup w handle | Acceleration is kind of lame you have to be light on the gas or you'll squeal the tires | I'll keep it because it's so economical and dependable | I haven't put a cent into it | But it is boring and really pretty terrible in the snow we have in Michigan | 
 "words": Purchased this car two years ago and haven't had any trouble with it | It's engine is noisy especially when the air conditioner is being operated | Driving up hills can add to the noise | The interior is useful and it comes it handy when transporting odd shaped objects | All in all I would purchase this vehicle again | I have to say it's a great transportation car and the price was just over 13000 | 00 new gas mileage is only twenty -two combine but gets a good 32 mpg on the highway to and from Vegas | 
 "words": I had a 2005 Matrix until I was T- boned on driver side after a minivan ran a red light at 50 mph | Car was totaled but I walked away with all limbs I was so happy w | the safety of side impact that I bought another Matrix 2007 | I love it | City MPG on manual trans | is about 29-30 MPG I calculate it every so often | I am only 5'2 so I like that the seat raises and I don't have to be too close to the steering wheel |

 "words": Can't say enough good things about this car | If you're short this car will fit you very well no longer have to have steering wheel in my chest to reach pedals | My husband wanted me to buy one with extra 6 total airbags but they weren't available in L | A | area | Fleet Mgr | found one from Oxnard area | In that pkg I got nicer wheel covers moon sun roof 5 CD changer and the extra airbags | I think my stereo rocks | Maybe I got a better one | Used the car to move things out of my mom's estate | I have picked up materials for kitchen remodel | Have averaged 30 mpg in heavy traffic city driving | I'm sure I'd get 40 on long drives | When necessary I can punch it and get the power I need | 
 "words": Great hauling space | Excellent mileage | Terrible radio display | Invisible with sunglasses on especially on a sunny day | Rough ride you can feel every bump | Jumps forward when moving from a stop | The PT Cruiser that the Matrix replaced was a better car to drive | 
 "words": I've owned my Matrix for about 13 months now | I have to say that I | m constantly reminded of how good of a decision it was to buy this car | I traded down from a 4runner and I have to say that I don't miss the cargo space | The cargo space provided in this matrix is unreal | The driving performance is good the interior is good and the fuel economy is good | Lets be honest if you're looking at this car it | s to be economical and you can't expect top of the line performance for the price | But for versatility there aren't many out there that can't beat this | I definitely recommend this for anyone trading down from a SUV | Handling is firm and responsive and fun to drive | 
 "words": I have the Speedway Blue M-Theory Special Edition | Awesome 17 wheels spoiler | Chicks love the car | Seriously | Mine's a 5 speed still has little power but I don't mind | I usually get about 32 mpg but I drive about 80 city miles | Haven't been on a long road trip to test strict highway mileage | I'm 6'3 car has plenty of room for me | The seat is only halfway back | Ride is a little rough with sporty suspension on M Theory | Occasionally clicking sound in brakes dealer says is normal that's a little annoying | Fun to drive | 
 "words": This is such a fun car considering it can seat four adults in comfort or carry a whole ton of stuff | The back seat is easy to drop flat yet is a real full-size adult seat when it is up | Despite being a proper little utility vehicle it also has great handling and a peppy engine you never want for power yet the fuel economy is great 35 | I do believe you need to choose the manual transmission with the available power here the automatic is much slower and also harder on gas | And I think it's a looker | One of my favorite details is the optitron gauges I know those are becoming much more common these days but I like how easy they are to read | 
 "words": The fact that I put on over 24k in the first year of ownership should tell you how much I like this car | My highway mileage when keeping the car between 65-70 has been routinely 38 mpg | In town 29 mpg | In terms of fun to drive factor this car has not disappointed | By fun I don't mean lots of torque | Think nimble like a Mini Cooper or other small wheel base car with perhaps a little more oomph | The power is more than acceptable for a commuter car | The capacity is deceiving with the seats down I fit 8' lumber with no prob | Headroom is excellent my 6'5 friend sits inside with room to spare | DIY maintenance has been easy with only oil filt change and tire rotation every 5k | 
 "words": I have loved driving my Matrix on trips and around town | The gas mileage is OK | This is my fifth toyota and I find myself constantly comparing which I should not do | I find that there is a lot of room especially when the rear seats are down | A mat would have been nice to cover the whole cargo area | I have read many revues on the car but have not yet seen my pet peave yet which is a roof rack | It is so very expensive to fit this car with a roof rack | I cannot believe it's not an option | But I guess given the overall performance gas mileage and especially the handling it still comes in as a number one car for me | 
 "words": This is my first new car purchase since 1994 | I love my Matrix | I never thought I'd be able to afford the car I wanted but the Matrix was both affordable and comfortable | It's a great car for tailgating and for all my gardening adventures because it just wipes clean | 
 "words": Might be a little under powered but a real fun car to drive | Auto power windows air etc | I love hatchbacks it has an extra wide opening and I can get all kinds of unconventional shape gear inside | 
 "words": This is a nice car | Excellent mileage easy to drive comfortable for a small car | Lots of road noise but it's a small car | The deal killer for me is you can't lock the doors with the remote if the doors are open | You get home from shopping it's raining you have to get out unload your stuff in the puddle filled driveway getting your stuff soaked fish your keys out of your pocket lock the car and get your stuff | Had I known about this feature I would have not bought this car | Instead of pushing the button you have to hold the button on the remote to open the glass hatch | It's faster to use the key | Bad design choices | 
 "words": We purchased our Matrix this summer to replace our aging and unreliable Plymouth | It has been a great decision so far | We have taken it on several weekend trips and it is a great travel car | Lots of room in the back for the bags and the dog | It has also been useful in around town driving | The fold down seats in the back are one of the car's best features | We never need worry about bringing home bulky items | I don't find problems with highway driving that others have mentioned | No issues with wind or milage | We average 30-31 mpg around town and 40mpg on the hwy | Though heavy traffic or driving consistently above 65 mph drasitcaly reduces fuel economy | 
 "words": After having been driven an Aurora and spending thousands of dollars on gas and repair I decided to buy a Toyota car | Since my 1st choice the Prius was a little over my budget decided to go with the Matrix | Bottom line I am very happy with my choice | The car is easy to drive has a lot of cargo space and I spend much less time at the gas pump |

 "words": After 11500 miles the Matrix is finally broken in enough to review it | The usable space is fantastic | It has plenty of zip for city town driving especially w TRD performance filter | Ours is loaded as possible w sunroof wheels upgrade stereo ABS airbag package trim package etc | These cars look silly w o the extra trim IMO | My disappointment rests in the cars rattles in the dash and elsewhere | Way too new for this and whatever happened to legendary fit and finish | Lousy Gdyr tires and their harsh ride had some to do w onset of rattles better ride and fewer rattles now w Michelin tires but it's still no excuse | Best mileage thus far has been 33 mpg highway disappointed | 
 "words": At the risk of sounding like all the rest this car is fun to drive | It's a great car for the practical value- seeker that wants a decent level of extras without settling on an econo- box | The XR sport package gives it just enough style to stand-out and satisfy the sport-minded | Mind you the true sports-car enthusiasts aren't even looking at this car | this is a car for the person that wants a basic car with a little bit of everything and an emphasis on fuel economy | I've been getting 34mpg in my 1st 4500 miles on a 70-mile day commute in mixed traffic conditions | 
 "words": What a change | I drove a V6 van before | The car only having a 4 cylinder has been a joy to drive | Instead of buying an SUV during my midlife crisis I have downsized to an efficient compact | The cargo area is great | The fuel consumption is low | I live In the second most traffic congested city in North America Toronto | We pay 1 | 00 per litre of gas 4 | 50 per gallon of gas |

 "words": Life long full size pickup owner here but decided to commit to reduced fuel use | I parked my full size pickup and purchased this for a work vehicle | I farm for a living and I was thinking of a Tacoma but was not sure the mileage would be good enough to switch so decided on the Matrix | Fuel mileage is 30-32 so far on 1000 miles drive with short distance on and off pavement driving | Loads of fun to drive as well | I couldn't be happier | 
 "words": We bought ours despite all the reports that the steering wheel is too far away etc | I am 6' 4 tall wife 5'4 and I am very comfortable in the front and rear of ours | My wife and 10 yr old daughter love it too | Our gas mileage runs about 27 overall but our first trip got 38 | 5 MPG | Beats the minivan we traded for it big time | We like the cargo room and are very familiar with the Toyota reliability | We are pleased in every way with this car even on trips | We highly recommend any Toyota | 
 "words": Bought this car because of Toyota reliability reputation and mileage | Use it mostly for running kids around town | It seems a little cheap inside for the cost but I'm used to nicer cars Volvo BMW | 
 "words": So far I love this car | I downsized from a full size truck and was not sure if I would like it due to the size difference | But the money saved in gas says it all | This car is fun to drive | Even with a 1 | 8 under the hood it has a quick start | There is room for a family of 4 to fit | My son is 6 foot 2 inches and still has leg room when sitting behind me | Car has great cargo room | I love the fact the rear glass opens separately from the hatchback door if you need to haul something over 8 feet in length | I have only had this car for a week so I will be doing a follow up review in a few months | 
 "words": If you're looking for a combination of cargo room gas mileage styling and performance this is the logical choice | More sporty looking than the Vibe in my opinion | If you want to look good while saving at the pump it's this or a mini-cooper | You can probably fit the mini-cooper in the back of your Matrix if you fold down your back seats but all I need to fit inside is two bicycles so no problem | If you're like most people and don't really need an SUV this is the smart mpg alternative | The manual trans is more fun to drive but I can eat better in traffic with the automatic | This is not a sports car so don't expect pony car power its fine especially compared with other 4 bangers | 
 "words": With the gas prices soaring I decided to trade in my SUV and get something with better gas mileage | The snag was that I still wanted the cargo space that my SUV gave me | That is what lead me to the Matrix | Honestly it is doing the job in excellent fashion | I haven't had it for long but I know that it will prove to be a good buy | The drive quality is good and responsive the handling is better than I had expected | All in all it has everything that I was looking for | I definitely reccomend this if you are looking for space fuel economy and a sporty good look all rolled into one reliable affordable vehicle | 
 "words": Got rid of my Nissan Pathfinder for this ride | I've put 800 miles on it so far without any problems | The manual tranny shift is at hand level which makes changing gears pretty effortless | Overall the vehicle is quite nimble and fun to drive although the engine is noisy in 1st and 2nd gear | Once up to speed it rides well | Mileage is a solid 26 city 29 highway | As others have noted the suspension is stiff so when you hit a bump or pothole you feel it | As you know the storage is fantastic with hatchback convenience | If you haul a lot of outdoor gear like skiis camping equipment or a bike this is the car for you | 
 "words": With gas prices threatening to be higher than last year I decided I needed my highly modified Oldsmobile Cutlass to NOT be my daily driver | A fully loaded Yaris is a rarity but a loaded Matrix M-Theory is not | Compared to others the options to price seem very good | The best mileage so far has been 28 mpg of combo driving | That was with the dealer's complimentary tank which leads me to believe it was over filled slightly | 25 mpg is the norm | Performance is anything but | The engine is NOT performance oriented at all | If you want something quick this isn't it | However it does handle quite well | Ride is firm sometimes harsh but still comfortable | For looks and features I'd recommend it | 
 "words": I can't say enough good things about this car | I've had it since December and already put almost 8000 miles on it | The gas mileage is amazing 35 miles to the gallon on the beltway | The design and handling are great | It's a smooth ride and there is more than enough room for myself and my family of four | More cargo room than any of the other wagons out there and it's a cute sporty mom car for the young at heart who aren't ready to graduate to the minivans but also not willing to suffer the cost of fuel in an SUV | 
 "words": I have only owned my Matrix a week but it is fantastic | I traded a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo | I thought I would miss the 4X4 and size | No way | This Matrix has already pulled itself through the snow is a joy to drive reliable and the gas savings is amazing | I also got everything that I had in the Jeep into the Matrix | Yes it is smaller and the steering wheel is a bit closer to the dashboard than I am used to but it is worth getting used to it over time | Definitely check this car out | You won't be disappointed | 
 "words": My Matrix XR replaced a Honda driven 10 yr 250k and loved | I have yet to develop same affection for Matrix | After 10k it seems reliable functional economical fun to drive | 5 sp shift is smooth but has a unique click sound each shift | Some design features are at times inconvenient or annoying | Visibility out side and back suffers | Front and rear seat headrests are always in way same for body roof posts | Warning signal for unbuckled seatbelts is loud obnoxious | Why all the noise when passenger unbuckles to remove coat or briefcase or box is on passenger seat | And panic button on the key fob is horribly designed | How many times have I accidentally set it off | Please don't ask my neighbors | 
 "words": So many practical reasons to own this car excellent gas mileage lots of cargo room Toyota reliability flat-folding seats | But what sold me on it was that it's just a fun car to drive | The handling is enjoyable the engine is more willing than its 126 hp would imply the interior is cockpit-ish the 6-cd sound system is decent the seats are comfy with cool fabric and the ride is nicer than the competition's | It's a nice mix of good stuff for the money | I was considering a Civic but the Matrix had more cargo space a nicer ride a nicer interior and was way more fun to drive | The auto I test drove was good but I recommend a manual trans with any small engine | 
 "words": Have to laugh re those people complaining about rides like a truck | Probably most have not HAD a truck | Definite car-like ride I have 1000 miles | No rattles good layout inside agree with the remark about the blower speed knob in front of transmission lever when in park although one would usually use the a c when driving | Handles well good acceleration for this type no tire squealing no rattles and I like the styling better than the pontiac Vibe | Good stereo I have the ABS and sunroof too | I got it for cargo space flexibility and true hiway mpg of over 35 31 around town | Mostly I use my motorcycle but sometimes I need a car and a Corolla underneath great | 
 "words": Rented a brand new '06 Matrix 1K miles on a vacation trip | We were thinking of buying one so it was a great to test one out for an extended period of time | Gas mileage was great but it lacked power was very loud as it kicked into lower gears on hills 2 people and luggage accelerator was very sensitive and the interior felt very cheap | Seats were comfortable for a few hours but sagged after a while | Should be OK for local commutes | Exterior shape is pleasing to the eye but put together cheaply | We hit a small pothole at low speed 5mph and one side of the front air dam popped off | Found out that it was held together by plastic screws when I went to snap it back together | 
 "words": I have two kids and this car fits my family perfectly | Cavernous | No but plenty large for a family of four and everything that travels with it | I love the comfortable seats the high seating position the interior space headroom in particular and the incredible gas mileage | You won't find a better value in this price range all things considered | 
 "words": While the gas mileage was a definite plus the lack of power in this vehicle and the size of other vehicles when driving the Matrix made me get rid of it | I didn't have any problems with it mechanically | I guess the 4 cyl ran as it was supposed to | I haven't had a 4 cyl for years so maybe it is just me but the car lacks power and is loud | Low profile made for uneasiness driving in rainy weather | Being in Western PA I felt that I should get rid of it for when it snows | 
 "words": After my 98 Pontiac Sunfire became too expensive to fix I had no choice but to purchase the Matrix XR 2007 sport suspension | After driving it for almost two weeks now I can say I like the handling the way it drives around the corners good mileage roomy inside | The only thing annoying is sometimes something rattles from the dashboard but I can put up with it | I wish it had more power going uphill but then again I like my mpg actually around 30 | I like to drive fast |

 "words": The Matrix is a Corolla wagon and is very similar to the Dodge Vibe | It has been a fun car to drive | What it lacks in power it makes up for in gas mileage | The interior of the hatch-back trunk is plastic so things can easily slide around | There are nets but we bought a mat that has helped to keep things from sliding around | 
 "words": Car handles pretty well | Also pretty generic looking car with number of issues | 1 My new car dash rattles I know take it to the dealer | 2 4 speaker stereo is bad you can't hear it when sitting on back seats | Back seats are very uncomfortable too | 3 Interior seat covers cheap | 4 Outside paint is very thin and pretty easy to scratch | 
 "words": My third day in this car and I love it | This car truly is a very practical alternative to the SUV | It's fun to drive and styling is good | Very roomy interior and plenty of room for cargo | I drove a mid-size SUV for years but honestly I don't have kids and I'm not hauling lumber so why waste the money on an SUV | I'm very happy with my Matrix | 
 "words": Rides like a truck | The gas pedal is very touchy | Easy to squeal tires when trying to enter into traffic | Price was right | Interior looks cheap | Excellent stereo system compared to most vehicles | 
 "words": I purchased a 2007 Matrix XR at the end of August | I wanted a car with a reliable reputation and ABS that went a bit beyond the Corolla that has been in the family for the last 5 years without any problems | I carefully read all reviews and find the car to date worth the investment | The fold down seats in the back are an advantage when the extra space is needed | Gas mileage open road -36 37 mpg | city and open road about 27 is very good | I recently had the opportunity to drive my sons 2000 BMW 320i | I found the Matrix to be better handling | of course he can get to 40 mph or more in a 35 mph zone faster | 
 "words": I traded a Pilot that got 18 mpg in on this Matrix for the same reason as everyone else | I have only owned it a week so some of the ratings of 9 are minor things really not worth mentioning in detail | A squeak here and there on the interior but overall a solid vehicle | I was amazed at the room inside | Being 6'4 I couldn't believe the room | I am looking forward to driving by the gas stations | I am curious to see though how it does in the snow | Overall a positive experience and I would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": After 1000 miles I have no regrets | Bought for its gas mileage and versatile interior which are even better than I expected | Ave | 29 mpg local and 37 mpg highway | Driver's seat is high but I'm short so its fine | Added side air bags stability and traction control ABS window tint and leather seats | The versatile interior is great whether carrying groceries or lumber | A more powerful engine would be nice but I'll take the mpg | A comfortable car mostly driven locally | I have no doubt this was an excellent purchase | 
 "words": Couldn't be happier with the 2007 Matriz XR | It replaced a mini-van and instantly doubled the mpg fun-factor and versatility | 
 "words": I agree with the previous review that the Matrix is possibly the best compromise in size comfort fuel economy and handling | Zippier than the bigger beast I drove before but definitely not the greatest sports-car handling | Love the storage and gas mileage | Put my bike in the back on its side with the seats down without removing the front wheel | I upgraded to get the side airbags | Stereo is excellent | Great for mostly city driving with lots of potholes and stop-and-go driving | Plenty of headroom but for someone 6'1 I'd rather sit an inch or two lower than the seat will go | Still breaking it in but I've only filled up the tank once in the past month | THAT I can live with | 
 "words": This is my first car since 1972 or so I can't remember and that was a Toyota Corolla great car that gave me 41 MPG on highways thru Texas | Great car and I never forgot it | I have been driving vans and trucks since and this year we decided to by a car and I went to the Corolla first and then to all the competitors too I test drove them all and wound up with the Matrix drives like the Corolla and had tons of room with seats that go down and even the front passenger seat goes down | To make a long story short we love the Matrix and our first tank of gas on the highway with the air going did 37 | 3 MPG Next tank was city at 30 | Third tank 33 city hway | What can I say | 
 "words": The Matrix is quite possibly the best compromise in size comfort fuel economy and good looks | A quiet and smooth drive with peppy acceleration I did not expect from the horsepower ratings | Great fuel economy 28 | 5 mpg in 80 20 city hwy driving and spacious interior | This was my SUV alternative and so far so great | I'm personally a big fan of the exterior styling although the interior dash could use a refreshing a la the new Camry | Toyota quality is excellent the doors close with a solid thwump not that empty hollow-door feeling | 
 "words": A true Toyota | Solid build quality cutting edge styling and outstanding fuel economy | Already averaging over 30 mpg and it's not broken in yet | Cut my gas bill in half instantly | Comfortable excellent stereo and tons of fun to drive | Pinch me |
