REVIEWS
 "words": Had for 1 year 14000 miles | Excellent fuel economy 27-30 on all highway | No mechanical problems | My wife would like an adjustable passenger seat seating position too low | Fit and finish second to none | RL has plenty of power I use it often on steep hills | I like the styling much more than the 09 grille has a richer more elegant look than the 09 | Handling is great in high speed situations far superior to the TL | I like the exterior design quite understated however I do see the point of someone saying it looks too much like a Honda | I understand the 2011 will be a totally new car | Acura Honda really does want to compete with the best from Lexus | After all is said and done would I buy it again | for sure | 
 "words": This has been an excellent purchase and both my wife and I are very pleased with the car | My only comment is that I feel the passenger seat should have the same power features as the drivers side i | e | the seat is too low for my wife | 
 "words": So far I have owned the car for a couple of months and do not regret the purchase at all | I bought it for safety primarily but realized that it also has the legendary Honda quality | The details of this car are incredible better than the German cars and value wise by 15 K at least also | The car feels like a tank but has the power to go when needed | This car has near 300hp and you feel every horse | The AWD is incredible it would take a bulldozer to take it off course | 
 "words": Like most readers I've driven them all but this one delivers a lot of bang for the buck | Does not handle like a 5 series will not out accelerate a 550i but it handles beautifully is great on the road and has an interior and audio system that puts the 5 series and E-Class to shame | Put that together with Acura's reputation for reliability and we have a BIG winner | 
 "words": This car looked like a terrific value but it has not turned out that way | I was looking forward to Honda Reliability but too many things just don't work well or are gimmicky | Fuel economy is atrocious 14-15 electronics don't work that well run-flat tires are super loud there is some wind noise key fob keyless entry never works the same twice in a row | Car is pretty slow off the line but decent on the highway | Ride is too much of a compromise | Handling is good but the Michelin run-flats are lousy performance tires in all but the correct temperature range | I came out of an Audi A8 and would NOT buy this car again | 
 "words": We wanted an AWD sedan after a string of average SUVs | This vehicle is a beauty | Excellent build quality and finish | It would be difficult to beat the value for money | It rides smoothly and is very comfortable | We are delighted with our purchase so far | 
 "words": Just purchased my RL | Build quality equal to or better than Lexus | A great value with current market support | SH-AWD useful in all weather not just snow | A smart looking car however not screaming 'I am here' | Had a 2004 TL and liked it this is much more car | I hope resale is as good on this as it was on my TL | Also owned a 2001 BMW 525 no comparison | The BMW was more like my TL | RL does seem overpriced until you drive it | 
 "words": Number one attribute isno wind noise | The only reason you can hear the quiet tire noise is because there is no wind noise | Very comfy seats | Great tech features | Not enough power especially low end torque | Phenomenal handling characteristics | This car will turn on a dime with good manners | Fuel ecomony is poor but I don't put on so many miles that it's a factor | 
 "words": I love the car | It handles very well a little sluggish compared to other car MB CLK 430A but is sufficient | I had a little bit of an initial quality problem HID headlight on right side burned out first day or so | Car was due to go back for dealer add-ons so no biggy | Was kinda shocked though | Key fob was nightmare for first two weeks | I made the mistake of initializing the car with driver 2's key rather than the 1 key the car hated that | It would madly and incessantly lock unlock and beep when I stood next to the car | Reinitialized the car to the driver 1 fob and it hasn't happened since | 
 "words": I drove a BMW prior to this and loved it but I am thrilled with my Acura RL | It is so smooth very responsive comfortable as it could possibly be and has every possible bell and whistle for thousands less than its Teutonic competition | I chose it over Infiniti M35 because in my test it handled better and I much prefer the looks | GREAT car so far |

 "words": This car is just an incredible vehicle very high tech but easy to figure out | The stereo is awesome love the subwoofer | Controls are very accessible | Voice command system works great | Smooth ride don't even know you are going as fast as you are yikes | Gas mileage not as good as I hoped but it is all wheel drive | This car has many options that you would pay 10k more for vehicle | handling is incredible and steering response is nice
 "words": Drove high end MBZ and Lexus for decades | Bought the RL for the seat bad back and took what came with it | For 20K difference I'm more than pleased with the result | The RL is a dream to drive and the cornering is amazing | The engine has all the power I need | I concur with all the positive comments seen here and have only one big squawk | I HATE THE STEERING WHEEL | It's not the wheel that's so bad even if it is too slippery it's that it's loaded with so much stuff it looks like a game controller | The shift paddles are right in the way for a clean grip as are the telephone buttons which I don't use either | Remove that crap and sticky up the wheel and I'd give fun to drive a 10 also |

 "words": The RL has been everything it was made out to be | Interior styling is excellent and instruments easy to see and use | Exterior is sleek with the exception of the standard wheels kind of boring | The upgrade they offer cost 3000 and you have to go to 18 rims | Only knock I have | 
 "words": I compared the BMW 5 series Mercedes Audi6 and Lexus 350 | No comparison | The RL has SO many more features for the money it is no comparison | The RL is SOOO comfortable to drive | I got the tech package being a techie myself | I love the quality and ergonomics of the interior design | The V-6 has some punch but not like a V-8 my only complaint | The AWD is simply awesome | The Bose 10 speaker stereo is unbelievable | 
 "words": I enjoy owning the RL | It is very comfortable and easy to handle | Acceleration is mild for horsepower rating | It behaves as though it has turbo lag | Entry is awkward seat and steering wheel take position when I get in the car rather than waiting until door is closed or car is started | Standard battery capacity is low | Have had to charge battery twice from sitting car with engine off trying to learn program the computer navigation system | Fuel economy is good |

 "words": Quality perfect never back to dealer for anything except for free car washes | I owned Porsche and BMW quality can not compare great value and better overall perfomance | 
 "words": Truly have fallen in love with this car because of it's intelligence | The german offerings do not have the creature sensitivity the Japanese can create | The driving experience includes more than just speed or performance | Integrated with it's performance is driver comfort and assistance | If you appreciate deep intelligence in design | get this car and you won't want to ride in any other car when you go places |
