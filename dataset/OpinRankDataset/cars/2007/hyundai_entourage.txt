 "words": We have an 2007 Entourage and wish we could get rid of it the A C clunks when you first start the engine something a 28000 | 00 new van should not do | After replacing the A C twice Hyundai finally said that was normal in all Entourage's so live with it and we found that when the Rep from Hyundai in California makes a decision that's as far as it goes | Great company policy if I were to lose my job they would take it back but have a serious problem with their product and it's tough | I have a 2006 KIAsister company Sorento with 17000 more miles on it then the Entourage and the KIA rides drives and sounds better then the Hyundai | Did I mention it sounds like a tank when cold | 
 "words": I've owned the vehicle for 2 1 2 years have over 64000 miles | the only problem I ever had was the sliding doors getting jammed | we just had them repaired nationwide problem we were told never had any other problems | dealership has great service | they remember me by name when I go in for service oil changes regularly | the only thing I don't care for is the resale value | there is none | depreciates too quickly 
 "words": I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007 | Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it | Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors | Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG not what I had expected | I want to get rid of it so bad but the value has dropped so much i can't get rid of it | 
 "words": I've owned this van for over a year now and have not had any problems at all with it | I purchased it used with 20k miles and I've since put on 10k mostly on the highway | The van is large and spacious similar to Odyssey Sienna and Caravan I've driven all of these | The performance is very good considering it's size and you have to remember that it's a minivan not a sports car | I think the build quality is good not quite up to Sienna or Odyssey levels but on par with the Caravan | The 5 year 60k mile warranty is a reassuring factor but I have not yet had to take advantage of it | Also I think gas mileage is pretty good I get about 26 mpg on the highway with a moderate load | 
 "words": Bought used in Dec | 06 with 11000 miles | It was Factory Reps vehicle | Was sold on Hyundai because of previous experience with Elantra and Sonata | This van has had 22 warranty claims since bought | The van is very competitive with Toyota and Honda in design and function just not in the owner satisfaction category | I feel that the biggest issue with this van in the dealerships service | Hyundai dealers remind me of the Domestic dealers from the past big on selling just not on service | You should not have to continuously take a vehicle in for the same issue and be told we don't know whats wrong with it sorry about your luck | They have fixed everything except the whine in right rear speaker |

 "words":  We got our Entourage when it first came out cause we love hyundai cars and needed a bigger family vehicle | We loved this vehicle until we started having major issues with it | We have already had to have the entire electrical system of the van replaced after only having it 11 2 yrs and it needs to be replaced again | Our power doors are a nightmare | They close then open right back up | When they actually do close the track keeps going even after the door is closed | When we pull on the door handles to open the doors they don't open | With in the last 9 months our van has been in the shop over 8 times for the same things over and over again | Now i understand why you need the warranty they offer | 
 "words": We paid for the extended warranty and glad that we did | Brakes started squealing within the first six months tires did not last as long as they should have battery died after about 50000 miles | They have had to change the air compressor the fuel sensor and a few other parts | We have had to get it towed twice |

 "words": Just an update after owning the Entourage SE for 6 months now | The only problem that we are having is that the check engine light comes on periodicaly | The owners manual says to check the tightness of the gas cap | So when it comes on usually at about a half tank I get out and unscrew the cap and retighten | Then by the next morning the lights off | Some day I'll get my butt in gear and get it to the dealer | But other than that the van has been nothing but fantastic | The kids love the DVD and the fact that the windows on the sliding doors go up and down | The wife loves the heated seats now that winter is coming and I love the horse power and smooth ride and the back up warning sensor |

 "words": This is a wonderful mini van | Has ALL the bell's and whisles | Tested the Honda Odyssey and the Toyota Sienna and THIS is the winner hands down | 
 "words": Absolutely LOVE this van | I really was only considering an Oddysey or a Sienna and after reading several reviews on this minivan we had to go and test drive one before spending much more on one of the others | We drove it right off the showroom floor | First and foremost the safety factor was far better than anything we had seen | We even went the starter model because it was so well equipped | My husband could not be happier with this purchase since it has the auto- manual transmission and he can pretend to race | I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone considering a minivan purchase | Honda and Toyota better watch out because Hyundai is proving to be a winner | 
 "words": We have had this van for about 4 months and have put 5000 miles on it with no problems | This van is awesome on the interstates and highways and has plenty of power | It is nice looking inside and out and seems to be well built | This is the fourth mini van we have owned with the last being a Chevy Venture | The Entourage is a much better van | So far my wife and I do not have any complaints | I do wish it got a little better mileage | Perhaps as the engine transmission get more looseit will | It gets about 21-22 mpg on the interstate at 75 to 78 miles per hour | Probably at 65 to 70 miles per hour miles per hour the mileage would be better | The warranty is excellent | Great van and I highly recommend it |
