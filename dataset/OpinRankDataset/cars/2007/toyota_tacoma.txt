REVIEWS
 "words": While driving at speed of just 70 MPH both my mud flaps tore broke and very expensive to replace | 
 "words": First Toyota truck I've owned | I've owned a Frontier and a Ranger in the past | The Tacoma is a little better than the Frontier and a lot better than the Ranger if you can get over the price difference | My Access Cab 4 cyl | is good on gas but is underpowered even with a manual trans | First gear seems to be geared too low and hard to find at times when rolling at lower speeds | The exterior design is OK with the stock wheels and tires too small for the well area The interior is nicely laid out with plenty of leg room for tall drivers | The radio is a little weak and the access cab area seating is too straight up for a comfortable ride | Overall quality is good just needs more 4cyl power | 
 "words": I've had this truck for a little over two years now | Traded in a horrible piece of GM junk 2000 Pontiac firebird needed a truck as I lived in a very rural area where trucks are a necessity | Reliability has been through the roof especially compared to all of the GM cars and trucks that we have owned over the years | I went with the absolute base model with auto trans as the only option but fit and finish is still excellent along with a plethora of standard features | It doesn't even feel like a truck with the elegant but tough looking interior and almost car like handling | GM should've taken note long ago or they wouldn't be in such dire straits | Overall I am very pleased | 
 "words": I bought this truck brand new over two years ago and I drive it for work every day | The Composite bed is a great feature as well as the power outlet in the bed | I didn't have a generator and it powered some basic items in my house for a couple days after a recent storm | The factory tires ride a little rough but have pretty good reliability | The stereo could be a little better | I love the design on the interior and exterior | Gas mileage is great | I usually average around 21-22 miles per gallon | Towing is ok but my 16' ski boat dogs it down a little | Unfortunately the bed dents easily like my last Tacoma | The front bumper should be chrome instead of plastic as well | 
 "words": I had a Nissan Pathfinder that had a 3 | 5 litre and never got over 16 mpg | This Toyota gets 20 mpg with a 4 | 0 litre | I have a TRD package so the bilstein shocks help the ride when I pull my 24 foot boat | The limited slip diff works well on slippery ramps | 
 "words": I'll start by saying that I've owned many Toyotas over the years and have been very satisfied with every one but this one | After 18k miles the engine began to knock loudly piston wobble and the tranny will kick after every stop driveline lash | These traits all called normal by Toyota | These trucks do not represent the quality the brand has developed through the years | If you can live with a truck that makes a nasty knock at idle shifts through the auto gearbox after a stop | only to thump you after finally finding first gear chasing wheel balance due to the hub offset being whacked and always having steering wheel shimmy | this might be the truck for you | 
 "words": I bought this truck new | I am an artist and have a lot to move | I have moved 3 times using the truck and love it | The economy is good for a truck especially on my long freeway drives | I was in an accident in the truck and was very safe | It is a wonderful truck
 "words": Only thing I would have to change is the paint | Drives like a charm reliability and drivetrain performance is great | Overall really happy with the truck | 
 "words": It's a jack of all trades vehicle | Plenty of room for the kids | Hauls all my stuff | Decent mileage for commuting | Has a somewhat bouncy ride but it's a truck and truth be told does ride better than most other trucks I have ridden in | Has really light and easy steering | Real easy to drive | The transmission is a dream | Smooth shifting and usually grabs just the right gear | You can slap the stick for quick acceleration | Tows my boat very easily | 
 "words": Overall it's a nice truck | Very comfortable good power and lots of features | The stock suspension would bottom out with a load 400 lb motorcycle in the bed but there is a service bulletin out to upgrade the suspension if you actually use it as a truck | Gas mileage could be a little better | I average 16-17 MPG mixed driving and topped out at 20 | 
 "words": I got the 07 Tacoma and love it | It drives better than my Firebird I had before it | Only knock is the gas mileage is not what I expected it to be | Also cruise control takes some getting used to | I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone | You must get a cold air intake and magnaflow muffler installed | It improves gas mileage and power and makes a great engine perform even better | Plus it is easy to install and fairly cheap | 
 "words": Love this truck | The truck only has 320 miles on it but it's been a joy to own so far | Lots of power handles great and comfortable | Rides better than my 02 Tacoma 4WD did | 
 "words": This truck is a very smooth ride has plenty of power and is very comfortable on long trips | Visibility is great you can see all around very well | The truck handles well at higher speeds when changing lanes and can be thrown around at lower speeds without feeling like your going to roll it over | The main thing wrong with this truck mine anyway is that at around 70 mph the front end seems to lift up and it loses stability and steering feel | A windy day and getting around some tractor trailers will make you have to really pay attention to what its doing | Strangely putting on more speed seems to improve this handleing defect | Seems to have a lot if wind noise coming off the outside mirrors | 
 "words": Got the SR5 package | Only a couple days old but this is a great great great vehicle | Drives great wonderful design elements and Toyota reliability | Compared to my girlfriend's 2006 Lexus IS250 the Tacoma drives like the truck version nimble and comfortable with a lift and bouncier shocks | Comfortable in heavy street and freeway traffic in LA | Everything feels solid and well put together | And something like 9 cup holders | 
 "words": After having owned several toyotas in the past I'm somewhat disappointed | 1 Idle indictates only around 600 rpm | however vehicle lunges and you find yourself riding the brakes | This is especially uneasy in stop and go traffic | 2 Brakes have a spongy feel and require a lot brake pedal force | 3 When driving with hand on the automatic transmission shift lever centrifugal force when making a right turn will cause the shift lever to move from the D drive to 4 gear automatically | 4 Seat position is too low | No adjustment | 5 Steering wheel radio controls designed top bottom together rather than left right separated | This causes you to take your eyes of road to use controls | 
 "words": I have the truck for about 1500 miles | It has following problems 1 | poor alignment I have to re-align front wheels to drive straight | 2 | power steel failed with fluid leaked out | It has to be serviced and part changed | 3 | rattle noise from right side of cab | It has not being fixed after two trips to dealership | 
 "words": Just purchased but the test drive sold this vehicle | I was ready to buy the Frontier a nicely-priced '07 mgr | 's special and decided I owed myself the test drive in the latest Taco | I have never owned either brand before | Traded a Sube still have an old 318 Dakota | The Fronty was a good truck but this blew it away in my opinion | I greatly prefer the adult interior styling and the overall road feel | Power was excellent and felt more controlled in street conditions than brand N | A very sophisticated pickup truck | Did not want the fuel and complexity of 4WD or cute lettering on the side so took the straight 4x2 dbl cab with the l b | Long bed rode better than the short | 
 "words": Actually went to the dealer to purchase a RAV4 to replace the wife's older RAV4 | She said she wanted to test drive the Tacoma and the rest is history | We didn't see the need for the offroad model and are very satisfied with the truck | I think a big plus with the wife is sitting higher than a RAV | Visibility is great | it drives very smoothly and shifts beautifully too | 
 "words": It doesn't have as much hp as the frontier or ridgeline | However it tows more has a higher payload rating and accelerates better than both of them | All the while it gets better gas mileage | Off road it is tough yet comfortable | The tacoma is the best compact truck out there period | It is expensive | You certainly get the value for what you are paying however a frontier becomes much more lucrative when it is 7k less | 
 "words": The drive and ride on this vehicle is very good | The transmission shifts good and is smooth in shifting | The brakes seem to be very responsive and firm | After the fact of purchase I found out that the plugs needed to be changed every 15000 miles | I really find that unacceptable | I changed them and restored the gas mileage back in the 18-20 mpg range | The Tacoma needs the timing chain changed out at 100000 miles | I find that unacceptable | I bought this vehicle for low maintenance costs | I don't think this will happen | 
 "words": I purchased a new new Tacoma PreRunner after testing a 2006 Tundra | I was pleasantly impressed with the Tacoma styling and the handling particularly when compared to its big brother | My only disappointment and it is minor at this time is the mileage of the automatic being rated at 6 miles gallon on the highway less than the 5 speed standard Tacoma version | 
 "words": Its true you get what you pay for | Every aspect of this truck is very near to perfect | Smooth quick quiet at hwy speeds eye catching at every turn and just overall comfy | Be sure to test drive this truck prior to making your final purchase | 
 "words": I've had this vehicle for one week | I replaced a 2004 model Tacoma Double Cab with this one | They finally moved the clock | Has more power doesn't seem to take up more room in the garage but feels larger | Brakes don't feel as mushy as the old style eiher | 
 "words": I thought my wife's 2001 Acura TL was quick but the engine of this Tacoma is impressive when power is necessary | Very fast | Rides like a truck which I enjoy but is still very smooth and comfortable to travel | Decent room for passengers in the rear although a little tight if you have tall people up front | Very nice interior although I've noticed a tendency to inadvertently push the steering wheel radio controls during turns | Overall a great looking and great performing truck | 
 "words": I looked around a lot before I bought my Tacoma | I had Chevys and GMCs too | I had three Dodges | This is the best overall truck I have ever owned | The pickup of the v6 is great | My fuel economy is getting better 18 | 5 as of 1000 mile mark | The quality of the paint interior all around looks is overwhelming compared to some other car company models | This Tacoma is nice to drive and comfortable too | It just looks good | Indigo Ink Blue | 6 CDs in radio is great | The sound of the radio is real quality | 
 "words": The 07 Tacoma is rock solid | Toyota's 4 | 0L engine is amazingly powerfull | This truck rocks | Get the upgraded sound system if you can swing it | 
 "words": Traded in a 2003 VW GTI for this truck as we needed a more family-friendly vehicle | Bought with TRD Sport Pkg1 | Truck looks great handles great fun to drive | There are some minor design issues that would make a difference | Looks awesome with hood protector stainless tube steps and Lund tonneau cover | Love the 115v power outlet in the bed but worried that composite bed material will scratch very easily | Need to find some carpet or something to line the bed with | Also wish you could get a factory sunroof in double cab models | Like any vehicle not perfect but pretty darn good and hope the reliability is as good as our Sienna | 
 "words": Great truck | No need for 4wd on PreRunner offroad | 
 "words": Just switched from an 06 Tundra access cab to the Tacoma Double Cab | Aside from it being a double cab the only size difference is the width | The Tundra was way too big for me but my new Tacoma fits me like a glove | Everything is with in an easy reach of the driver | s seat | 
 "words": I'm hoping this truck will match my 1986 toyota pickup's reliability | I must say that so far the ride has been lots of fun | Better gas mileage than my s-10 zr2 and plenty of pep for a 4 cyl | The interior is a step above the colorado and ranger the ride is much more refined as well | 
 "words":  I have experienced so far with my Tacoma that they have got everything the way that it should be | The truck runs like a sports car and handles as well as anything I have driven | The part I enjoy most is the raw power of the truck I have owned pickups with V-8 motor that would not outperform this pickup | 
 "words": This truck is everything I've ever wanted in a car | It beautifully mixes aesthetics with utility | The interior is roomy and brilliantly outfitted it doesn't even seem like a truck | The quality is impeccable | Truly an amazing ride | 
 "words": My Long String Of Tacomas Started When I Was 16 Now 41 Ilove These Trucks I Work long And At Night I Like To Take My Truck Out To The Off-Road Rally Track In NH My Long Time Neighbor Bought A Nissan Frontier He Is Always Sorry When We Go To The Off-Road Track 'Cause he never wins My Favorite Tacoma The 1997 Toyota Tacoma
 "words": This is my third Toyota truck | I've had an '86 '99 and this '07 | It rides well gets the same gas mileage as my last one and better than my old '86 four cylinder but with more power | Engine is smooth quiet and powerful | Transmission shifts smoothly | Very comfortable inside | Fold down rear seatlets work great for holding ice chests for camping | On the down side The rear end bottoms out easily under load | Can be remedied with add-a-leafs or air bags | Not much ground clearance I may get a lift kit | I liked the old lever-type 4X4 range shifter better | New electronic dial type range selector works reliably but not as smooth and predictably as an actual lever did | 
 "words": I purchased a replacement for my 2001 Jeep Wrangler intending to do better than 12 mpg | The Toyota delivers about 18 mpg highway thanks to the terrible new corn fuels that are terrible for the environment anyway and 12 mpg city | After about 7 months of ownership my check engine light came on | 6500 worth of warranty work and 4 trips later it is off | My dealer kindly loaned me a fully loaded Avalon to drive in the mean-time | I hate the plastic bed but I'm certain the decreased weight saves on gas mileage | The looks are ok I prefer 4th generation Tacomas 2001-2004 over the 5th | Paint chips like crazy on my silver model | The painted plastic bumpers etc are a bad idea | 
 "words": I have been driving this truck since new in Apr | '05 and I have encountered no reliability problems and have no complaints | Road trips are no problem comfort is there ride is nice | With mixed driving and my sometimes heavy foot I average 18-19 mpg | highway average with cruise set 70 to 75 mph I will average 19-21 mpg | I would recommend this truck with no question | 
 "words": Nice truck with excellent off road capabilities | This truck will get you and your gear out and back without a problem | It can climb steep inclines narrow enough to get through the trees light enough to get over the mud and a great turning radius for a truck | I've yet to get this truck stuck in the deserts of Utah or the mountains of Colorado | It's certainly not a luxury vehicle but comfortable and fits well | 
 "words": My best purchase ever | Drive 80 miles daily and recently slowed down to 55 with the cruise control on | Best mpg so far is 26 mpg 55 mph | Usually I'm 22-23 mpg but I consistently drive under 60 mph | Recent valve rattle is a concern and I will check for technical service bulletins | Have not missed an oil change and it cannot be normal for a new engine to rattle | Toyota can be tough but be persistent and do not accept defects as normal | I demanded an engine rebuild 108000 miles on a Camry due to an oil sludge problem caused by an engine re-design in order to receive a higher EPA rating for the 2 | 4L engine | The dealer rebuilt the engine but it took serious effort | 
 "words": Bought the reg | cab 4x4 for utility and reliability | The truck has lived up to my expectation except for the 5 spd manual trans | The trans | has rattled when in neutral since day one | Rattle is tolerable except when A C compressor is running | Had dealer inspect but they claim it is normal | If I wanted a truck that rattled I would have saved some money and not bought new | I would not buy this truck again do to this problem | If you are going to buy a Tacoma don't get the 5 spd | I haven't heard anything about the 6spd or auto | There is no point in spending extra money for a Toyota if they are going to build them like Fords in California | 
 "words": I think the Toyota Tacoma V6 is great strong Motor and the 6 speed m t works fine I find the oil changes very easy to do I love the location of the oil filter | But I have had some problems with chipping paint also | Furthermore the seating position is a little low | Also no iPod connection my company work van has one | Also I wish the Tacoma had pop out wing windows my 2004 Tacoma did | The Tacoma has great looks and it will be easy to sale | I suggest getting the tow package 6500lbs the Tacoma is strong and can handle towing and off road driving | Its easy to beat up any truck but in 10 years this truck will be still on the road reliable |

 "words": This is my 2nd Tacoma and 4th Toyota | I knew this was the only truck I was going to buy the only thing was to decide a color black | There is a lot of storage | The storage under and behind the rear seats is beyond great | The composite bed is much needed | Although it can be slick | The engine power is excellent and after 17K miles I get 21 hwy and 18 mixed driving | I have no complaints except the paint scratches very easy | Toyota needs to address this along with the 17 sport wheels that have a pitting problem in the finish | 
 "words": I love my Tacoma | it's fun to drive and I think it gets better gas mileage than rated on freeway driving | The styling is the greatest and the power is great | I probably would get better street mileage if I kept my foot out of it but I love the power response | 
 "words": Great truck good ride lots of room for 5 people | I have had some problems with engine valve rattle but Toyota says its normal despite any changes in fuel brands and octane levels | Cannot get any help from Toyota on this issue | I suggest getting an extended warranty because the mfg is no help | 
 "words": I would recommend this to anyone looking for a well put together good gas mileage fun to drive truck | You will not hear a complaint from this owner | I drive typically 160 miles per day and the comfort and reliability are astounding | 
 "words": Very nice truck with an excellent ride | This is my third Tacoma and by far the best | I use my truck mainly for personal transportation and I bet I represent a large number of buyers | With that in mind Toyota should make available more creature comforts i | e | power seats heated mirrors a sunroof auto temp and leather seats | The tire monitor system is useless it only indicates you have low tire pressure but doesn't tell you which tire | The system GM uses gives you a readout of the tire pressure in each tire a much more useful system | Even with the short comings I'll buy this truck again | 
 "words": So the truck now has 16k miles | Other than the initial axle problem things have been OK | I monitor every tank and the truck was 16 city and 18 | 5 hwy with canopy until I put new tires on which dropped me 2 mpg 265 70 17 4wd works flawlessly | The cruise control is still useless-surges gears-and seatbelt and back-up warning quit working | Speaking of tires despite claims you CAN NOT go wider than 265 without rubbing even w 3 lift unless you replace the rims and sensors-big | Smoking problem has cleared with 3rd synthetic oil change whew | 
 "words": Did an immense amount of research before purchasing | It wasn't even close when all was said and done | If you are looking for a 4 door compact pick up this is your baby | 239 hp in the V6 is more than enough and avg | 19-20 mpg overall | The interior and ride is superior to competetors | The appearance was aesthetically appealing as well | Toyota has a long history of quality reliability | I previously owned Ford and Nissan pick ups and the Toyota is my favorite by far | I plan on keeping this one for many years | 
 "words": The truck has done well for me | It has met my expectations to date | The only draw back is the dealer installed cruise control | 
 "words": Having owned Ford long beds this truck is far superior in every way except power on hills | I chose the I4 Prerun for value reasons and it's lived up its name | Hauling a motorcycle on a hill with the manual tran at 70 was not a problem nor has getting 22-27 26-7 if you drive speed limit | my overall avg | is 23 | 5 on the highway for my daily commute | I've driven 8 hours straight one stop for gas and enjoyed comfort comparable to the Accord | cruise control is a must | Also the midrange power from 70-85 has been surprisingly responsive for those days when you're in a rush | IMO this truck is a long term keeper | 
 "words": I am in the process of purchasing an 08 | I was hit head on at about 50 mph | and I walked away | The cab was totally intact | I loved my 07 and can't wait to get my 08 | Fun to drive and travel in | 
 "words": Purchased this truck to get better mileage than my old 1999 Dodge Dakota | So far gas mileage has been terrible I am a careful driver | the engine is under powered and the rough downshifting on even slight inclines makes the cruise control useless | Ride is spongy steering is loose lots of noise from the engine and road | 
 "words": Purchased new 07 Toy to replace a 03 Honda Oddy after much research | Wanted 4 wheel drive | We love driving it when it runs | It has been back to the dealership 4 times and they can't figure out what is wrong | It just will not start | We park it go to bed and get up in the morning to a truck that won't start | We really like the back country but now we are afraid to go there as we never know whether our toy will run or not | This is our 4th Tacoma so we thought we were getting quality | 
 "words": Everything has been upgraded from what I was used to | Coming from my previous 1999 version of this same truck the 2007 version is longer higher wider stronger and smarter | I am glad that they have made standard the 4x4 mode being switchable from the dash and also improved rust preventation under the chasis by using thicker steel other alloys and rust inhibiting paint | Standard features I would of thought would be extra bedliner CD AC etc | There is no comparison out there | Nissan Ford Mazda Dodge and Chevy can only hope to ever match the quality dependability durability and plain sleek smart design of the Tacoma | The Toyota Tacoma continues to define the small truck genre | 
 "words": The truck was delivered with everything working correctly and not one mark on the finish | 13000 miles later everything is still working no warranty issues to date | The finish does have a few nicks now | 
 "words": I was looking at the Frontier and the Tacoma | I decided on the Tacoma because of the superior space in the rear seat and Toyota's responsible tradition of workmanship and durability | Not sure if it matters but the battery is huge | I have a double cab short box SR5 Off Road Package and there is plenty of room for adults in the rear seat | As for the problem mentioned by the Editors of this site regarding the low seats it took my lower back 2 weeks to get used to it but now I love it all good things take some getting used to | The truck handles great off-road better than I imagined | This truck is a small tank | It handles curbs at 30-40mph no problem | oops |

 "words": I absolutely love this truck although it does lack in some areas for me | Despite having the performance engine and upgrades for a Tacoma it just doesn't have enough power for me | Also when I bought my truck the windshield wasn't sealed correctly and it produced very loud whistling at interstate speeds | The local Toyota dealership replaced the entire windshield for free though and now the truck has no problems | 
 "words": My 4-dr 6 cyl 5 | 0 was great until I hit 30K miles | Started having slipping or transmission problems | Took it in for servicing got the standard cannot recreate issue | Also the Tire Pressure Sensor TPS system light comes on for no apparent reason tire pressure is OK 3rd time this has happened in 1 | 5 years | VERY disappointed in Toyota | was hoping to have this truck for 8 years | Probably going to sell ASAP |

 "words": I test drove a previous model year Tacoma and the difference is night and day | I always wanted one and finally broke down after my last vehicle died | The thing that surprised me the most is the outstanding turning radius | I have put about 13k on it since I got it in December last year and have had no issues | All around this is a reliable comfortable sleek and fun drive | Great acceleration | Great handling | Could not be more happy with any other truck | My friends envy me | 
 "words": This is the first pickup I've owned and I generally have high marks | I imagine it's as capable as any other in its class and IMO it rides extremely comfortably | One major disappointment is the chintziness inside | My gearshift knob swims in place while the gearshift itself shimmies endlessly in the front gears 1-3-5 | There's also a cheap plastic compartment next to the steering column that doesn't shut properly and I've never used it | I've also been disappointed by the fuel efficiency | While it reports 23 28 I have yet to get anywhere close to 20 mpg from a tank | From a drive standpoint the manual 5-speed seems essential for responsive on hills turns tough on-ramps etc | 
 "words": I love everything about this truck | The v6 is a great engine has plenty of torqueand I am getting 20mpg combined w mobil 1 in the crank | The ride is good even w the TRD sport susp | I think the long W B helps | I have 9k on it and it has not been back to dealer yet | I get compliments everywhere I go | It is a fun truck to drive |

 "words": I bought my 07 Prerunner Access Cab after stepping down from a Chevy 1500 Z71 and I couldn't be happier | While I loved my full size I love the improved fuel economy and the great pickup my V6 has | It has all the creature comforts you need and is comfortable | I am 6'4 and have no problem being comfortable in the front seat although I wouldnt recommend the jump seats in the rear for any adult over 6' | Could use a little more padding on the seats but I love the fold flat feature | Makes it easy to load groceries or bulky items | I love the track system in the bed | Makes it easy to find the best tie down spot for my load | Altogether an excellent buy | Will not be disappointed with this truck | 
 "words": This truck is a typical well built reliable vehicle from Toyota | I just got out of a full size P U and I'm confident this 07 Tacoma will perform as well or better than my full size one | 
 "words": I've only had it a few days but after driving a 6 cyl | manual Ford F150 for 4 years this is a godsend | I bought an '07 Tacoma PreRunner with the TRD off road package | It has been an exceptional truck and I've had several of my neighbors co-workers comment on it | I think I made the right decision | The Indigo-blue looks outstanding | It beats the Ford F150 6 cyl | into the ground for power | 
 "words": Toyota Tacoma offers a reliable vehicle but option packages were not flexible | Wanted cruise control but that only comes with extended cab | Color and other options very limited | Design is cookie cutter | Lots of extra holes in the dash for accessory switches that will never be used and so on | I4 engine is underpowered making it necessary to manually shift between 3rd gear and drive | Cruise control is useless on roads even with slight inclines | The transmission downshifts constantly with a very jerky motion | Driver and passengers are constantly being thrown back and forth | Even slight side winds whip truck around on highway | Fuel economy not even close to what I thought it would be | 
 "words": The ride is surprisingly comfortable and it has all the power I need for passing on two lane roads | To top it off it's beautiful inside and out | After a bit of research I find no reason to be concerned about the plastic bed | 
 "words": Having spent over a decade in an S-10 Blazer I was amazed at the quality of materials quietness and smoothness of the Tacoma | My son-in-law has an '02 Tacoma that he loves | Driving my '07 is a pleasure | It has a great view of the road ample power a smooth-shifting manual 6 speed and ice-cold AC | The seats are comfortable and all of the controls within easy reach | I found the stereo to be more than adequate for my tastes I'm not an audio snob | The locking rear differential is a nice bonus | I'm looking forward to many years of service from this truck | 
 "words": After several very positive experiences with Toyota I came up with a downer | Quite evident the more Toyota grows the more it has taken some quality control out of there vehicles | I have 6k miles on mine and have an off and on noise that happens at 75-80 dealer can't diagnose 'cause they can only drive it up to 70 front dash rattles passenger door rattles and has had to be towed as it wouldn't start Thank God I purchased the extended service plan otherwise I would have been really irked paying for towing on a 3 month old truck | I wouldn't mind a littler better mileage but it's not bad | Power is good for a V6 and comfort is good as well | I still like it but wish it were better | 
 "words": There's a lot to like with the latest Tacoma truck | Nice interior and the V6 is smooth and powerful | Its size is just right | Issues | The auto trans doesn't seem to shift right | Rear springs are weak I had to replace and I don't haul anything heavy or put up with it bottoming out | Front end gets out of alignment easily | Does the PreRunner really need to be be so high off the ground | I'd like better MPG but at least I can get 20 or better | 
 "words": This is definitely the best vehichle I have ever owned | I highly recommend this truck to everyone | Easy to drive and fun to get behind the wheel | All systems at the touch of a finger tip | I give My truck 10 stars |
