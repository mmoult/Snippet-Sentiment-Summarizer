REVIEWS
 "words": My wife and I enjoyed the car for the first 45000 miles but since then the Touareg can't make it 500 miles without a check engine light bad cooling fans sunroof and windows that mysteriously open by them selfpower seats that fail X brake that won't release etc | In fact after the last visit to the dealership we could not even get off the lot because the brakes were locked and would not release | It is VW policy that if a item doesn't fail like our power seats which made a horrible grinding noise and would freeze in the down position VW will not warranty the item | VW would just unfreeze the seat and say that it did not fail and we had to live with the grinding noise | BEWARE OF VW | 
 "words": We have 43000 miles on the Touareg and still enjoy driving the car | We especially like the quiet solid ride | Handling is shape with good braking | Transmission shifts smoothly in drive drop down to the sport position and the performance gains are note worthy | The power is excellent with a average of 17 | 5 mpg in SoCal driving | We just replace the front brake at the VW dealer 600 the back brakes should be good for 60000 miles | The tire were replace at 36000 miles | The GPS lacks detail but the backup camera make the GPS a fair value | Much better car than the FX45 we traded in | The interior has shown no signs of wear the heated seats can bake your backside in short order | GREAT SUV
 "words": I got mine since may 2008 | I have v6 tdi version | Fuel consumption around 26 mpg in city- 36-40 mpg at highway | Not bad for diesel | If compare to 16 21 for us v6 version I have done test drive with VW staff | It's amazing what they do with touareg | We were at Nice off road and on airport take off lane | Definitely will take my to us next time | 
 "words": With 42000 miles the brake pad light came on | The dealers proposed cost for pads and rotors rotors were required even though no evidence of need 1690 | That is correct nearly 1700 for initial brake work | Oil changes run 130 | Any part is extremely expensive | On a BMW this brake job would be free | The care is needlessly expensive to operate | 
 "words": I liked this car a lot | The ride was great very comfortable and a ton of features | My first choice at the time was the x5 but it just came out and it was extremely expensive | I got it all decked out fully loaded nav rear view camera better leather folding mirrors power steering wheel | I really liked the information display in between the tachometer and speedometer | it gave me a ton of info about my vehicle | Although i liked the car i felt the steering was too loose meaning i had to turn hard to turn especially at low speeds | I also though the design was boring even the rims were boring | I didn't have any technical issues with the vehicle | I just purchased a x5 and its even better
 "words": This is my second Touareg first was a gasoline 2004 had a few problems as it was the first year out this car is much improved and a rocket ship faster than the sister Porsche by | 6 second Cayenne S no problems so far in 5000 miles | 
 "words": My previous SUV was am Acura MDX which I was totaly satisfied with | The Volkswagen drives so much better feels better its the euro feeling same mileage much more power but everyday I enjoy the vehicle more and more its not the Volkswagen our parents had years ago | 
 "words": This mid-size SUV is a great SUV | It is extremely well built the fit and finish as well as quality of materials is excellent | On par with what you'd expect from any of the top German automakers | I was a bit skeptical at first | After all dropping 50k for a VW just didn't seem to make sense ah but when you test drive it you'll love it | I did and drove a V8 fully loaded home | The ride quality is outstanding and the engine is excellent in regards to accelleration and fun to drive factor | If it continue to perform in this manner I'd definitely buy another VW | Let me just say it's not your Grandpa's VW anymore it a modern art masterpiece | 
 "words": This SUV has got it all | The acceleration on it is marvelous | I have enjoyed driving it most going up-hill with four passengers that's when it really shines | The interior layout makes everything easy to reach and operate a rare find these days | Volkswagen showed off on this one the X5 M-Class MDX and RX 330 have nothing on this one | 
 "words": Replaced my 2003 Acura MDX which I thought was a great vehicle | This car outshines the acura in every respect | They changed the engine this year and it's great no complaints but it's still new | I can't feel the transmission shift | If it stays like this in the future I think I've died and went to auto heaven | 
 "words": I only have had my Touareg for four weeks now | It has no brake noise at all | I can't feel the transmission shift at all | There is a major difference in the power of this engine vs | the the past one tested last year | It it totally stable on the turnpike at higher speeds and it puts my Acura MDX to shame in all respects except for the rear cargo room which I didn't need it anyway | It has a real Euro ride | I hope it stays this way | 
 "words": I purchased an '07 Passat 3 | 6 fully loaded with every bell and whistle and had problems from day one and couldn't wait to trade it | I was reluctant to buy another VW but have always loved the Touareg and got a great deal on mine | It is 10 times the vehicle and I love the comfort safety and performance of my V6 I had wanted the V8 but they didn't have any in Atlanta and none with the 350 HP engine | I had heard terrible reliable ratings for this SUV but so far I am completely pleased it has no squeaks or rattles and very solid feel | It has horrible gas mileage but I knew that when I bought it | I have always owned BMW's and Mercedes the standard features on my Touareg are options on these other two | All in all I am very pleased | 
 "words": This is an amazing small SUV but it does not come with built-in satellite radio it's not even an option | I don't like to use standalone dashboard-mounted satellite radio player | Also the navigation system does not have voice recognition | 
 "words": I am very happy with my new Touareg | I waited for the 3 | 6L FSI engine and it does not disappoint | The fit and finish here is top notch | I have owned BMW's and Audi's and I like the Audi feel of the Touareg in terms of ride quality and German feel | Nice rig | 
 "words": We really love our Touareg | The build quality is top notch from the first class interior to the 3 | 6L FSI V6 which really feels like a V8 and is more economical | This vehicle is a nice ride | I really like how comfortable the car is and that you do not hear any road noise at all | I have owned a lot of BMW's and one Audi and you just can't beat the German car feel here | I also like the idea that the Touareg is somewhat unique in that you don't really see many of them on the road | Everybody has a X5 MDX or whatever | The Touareg stands out from the rest | This vehicle is a keeper | 
 "words": I looked a many SUVs like the Tribeca Sante Fe CR-V and choose the VW because of the leg room and comfortable ride | With 4900 miles I regret not buying a Honda Toyota or Nissan | I have had a brake squeal every time the brakes are applied and the VW dealer says it's normal and part of the brake design | I'm embarrassed to drive anyone in my vehicle | 35000 is a lot of money to let a vehicle sit in the driveway | You won't find a vehicle with better comfort or handling but the trade-off is the brake squeal | It's annoying and I am filing a Lemon Law complaint if it can't be fixed | I won't buy another VW again | 
 "words": I love to drive my Touareg and drive about 20000 miles annually | I enjoy the style handling and overall quality of the vehicle | That said BEWARE | The brakes last only about 30000 miles and cost about 1600 to replace | The tires are pricey and burn out at under 40000 miles as well | A small front rattle is common but minor easily fixed with felt | Don't get me wrong I love the ride but for the money I expect more in services and extras that VW just wont deliver | Check out the Audi SUVs for a better deal | 
 "words": I have owned other mid-sized premium SUVs and this one is my favorite | It handles so well and I feel very safe in it | It has surpassed my expectations and continues to do so | 
 "words": The Touareg has excellent build-quality power handling comfort | and it is fun to drive on and off-road | Despite some of the complaints the FSI V8's fuel economy is on par with any comparable performance AWD vehicle with 350 hp | 
 "words": The 2007 Touareg V6 has a nice ride | It's a smooth truck and a beast in the snow | 
 "words": I am amazed with the car like ride and Lexus like build quality | I love the design and confident stance | 
 "words": This vehicle is great | The build quality and rigidity are excellent and it is more comfortable than my old Cadillac Escalade | The reliability has been excellent as well though that is to be expected from a VW | I have had no problems whatsoever | I already have almost 7000 miles on it and it runs very well | The gas mileage isn't perfect but considering the fact that the vehicle is built better than a tank and tows 7700 lbs I don't mind | The V6 is not the most athletic of engines but the V8 is too much for me and I couldn't justify paying almost 70000 with options for the V10 TDI but it has plenty of power and is very smooth as is the tranny | Buy one | They don't fail to satisfy | 
 "words": This SUV is really good | I can easily pull my boat with it | It's also very safe | It has lot of space in the interior | 
 "words": We're thrilled with Touareg | It drives like a car and is solid nothing is loose anywhere | The doors and sunroof shut tightly and very it is quiet inside | That seems to be the VW trademark lately | This truck is really well made | Its power delivery is smooth but it's a heavy car | So be patient | I've had three Japanese cars a Nissan Infiniti and a Lexus and four German cars a BMW Mercedes-Benz and VW | Personally I find German cars to be more sturdy functional and practical | Some might say Japanese cars are more refined sophisticated | etc | The Touareg exemplifies all these qualities without losing its German character | 
 "words": What a wonderful German engineered SUV | It is the best in its class by far | I have had no problems with mine | 
 "words": I fell in love with my Touareg the moment I took it for a test drive | It's fun and I feel in complete control | Its gas mileage is low but its an SUV | I haven't had an issue yet but it's still early | I enjoy it | 
 "words": This is the best vehicle I have ever owned in my 20 years of driving | VW went above and beyond on this one and the dealership was great too | 
 "words": The Touareg provides the best in on road performance combined with the best on off road performance as well | It is quiet and refined on the highway and has excellent turning radius for it's size | The Touareg is by far the best value for a premium SUV | 
 "words": I love my new Touareg | I don't think that I've ever said that about any other car I've owned | My last two new cars were Volvos that I had both under a year ouch | The Touareg has every little gadget and more | It has all the features that my husbands 06' BMW 750Li not to mention that the Touareg has a backup camera and his doesn't | The V8 Touareg is fun to drive especially going up our curvy mountain road in Sports Mode | This SUV is not only fun to drive but has great curb appeal | I have had quite a few people stop and ask me about my Touareg and love telling them about | I hope that when I turn it at the end of the lease that VW will continue to make the Touareg as good or better |
