REVIEWS
 "words": I purchased my Edge 1 09 | I got it used with about 31k miles on it | The only problem with it was a noise coming from the gas tank | Once I let the dealership know they took care of it free of charge to me | They said that it was the mechanism that keeps us from hearing the gasoline moving back and forth in the tank | Mine was loose and making lots of noise | No problems now | I travel to New York about twice a month and this is one sturdy and comfortable ride | The back seats recline some and the front seats are just wonderful | There is ample space in the back for luggage | Other than the gas tank issue this has been a great experience thus far | 
 "words": My Edge has stalled on me several times usually stop lights and the Dealer can't find anything wrong with it | Does anybody have the same problem | The tires are very noisy Hancookand I had a rear bearing replaced already | 
 "words": This is the first U | S car that I have owned that equals Honda in quality | It is a safe car with good handling and a good ride | 
 "words": Nav is kinda lousy | The rear dvd is awesome | Heated seats are insanly awesome | Love toasty buns | Motors right along | Looks better with 20's | 
 "words": I received my Edge in May 2007 | Vehicle was great until January 2008 when it started leaking transmission fluid | Brought to the dealership they told me nothing was leaking | I had to ride with windows down in January in Maine | They replaced seals in the differtial many times | The transmission has been replaced | Still leaking | Ford rep finally looked a the vehicle and they are replacing everything again | If this doesn't work they say they will buy the vehicle back | The vista roof also stuck open in a rain storm | Not fun | The dealership had the vehicle for three weeks during the repair they dented the roof drivers door and scrathed the doors on the inside | Dealership not helpful 
 "words": The oil is constantly leaking have had the car in the shop multiple times they can never find it or say that it doesn't need to be filled all the way for the transmission then my panoramic sun roof exploded shattered over my head one night driving down the road nothing hit it and there were no other cars trees just shattered scared me to death | Shock on right side leaking smoking fixed not fixed lost part not the right part what other excuse could Ford give | This is my first and last Ford oh and the paint has bubbled on the drivers side door and the door lock on that side will never unlock with automatic unlock and they say it needs oil ha that doesn't work either
 "words": This vehicle shows the direction Ford is going | Better interiors high quality and still amazing performance | This makes it a winner | I think any Dad would love this as a very safe fun and versicle package | This car received the highest score for safety | Believe me once someone hits you and you are in a car accident you will check this every time before making a decision on a car for you and you family | Safest CUV available | I think any young or fun couple with love to have this in their garage | 
 "words": I bought an SEL in Creme Brulee loaded with all the options including the panorama roof and navigation system | I traded in a 2004 Explorer Eddie Bauer V8 for the Edge | Compared to the Explorer I like the ride lower step in height better mileage and roomy back seat | On the downside the interior of the Edge is a sea of hard plastic and poorly styled interior elements | compare the front interior door panel of the Edge to a Saturn Outlook and you will see what I mean | The interior is way to cheap and cold feeling for a 35000 car | The navigation system is good but not great | 
 "words": My Edge is currently being serviced for it's fourth transmission seal and second PTU Assembly | Soon after purchase the interior began to rattle and reveal the cheap material and poor workmanship | The brakes perform poorly and the car continues to pull to the left for no reason | The dealer and Ford offer no support except to tell me the transmission problems are a known Edge defect | AWD is great in the winter it's quiet and the engine is powerful | Average 18 mpg | When not in the garage it's a fun car to drive | 
 "words": december 18th 2008 I purchased a 2007 ford edge | i have enormous problem with the transmission
 "words": What a difference from my orginal 06 Ford Escape Hybrid to a 07 Ford Edge Ride is excellent and power is great could have tuned engine better for better gas mileage but I will give up the 3 or 4 miles over my Escape Hybrid | With the Edge I will have the A C always on with the Hybrid you loose the A C on Hybrid mode Beware | Towing was real easy and with the all wheel drive a breeze with getting the boat out of the water | Styling has got allot of eyes looking at it and saying what is that and when I say a Ford they say no way with that style | I would suggest test driving and seeing for yourself | 
 "words": We have had our Edge for about a month now and are very pleased with the purchase | A couple of recommendations to Ford though 1 the rear hatch needs to be power operated 2 improve the vents on the driver's side air seems to hit the steering wheel and doesn't cool the drive well | Initial quality has been outstanding | Built solid and has low road noise | Doesn't sit too high for my 5'2 wife to get in and out of but is good hight for visibility | Gas mileage is fair but we knew it wouldn't be great with the powerful 3 | 5L V-6 | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle in June with high hopes I'm over 6ft | After living with the vehicle I am sadly disappointed in its comfort | If your over I say 5'10 you need not apply | The seat bottom cushions are far to short to offer support for longer legs | The footwell for the driver is short on space also making driving very uncomfortable and your only relief is when you go to cruise control on a hwy | Despite the suspect claims of good gas mileage from other reviewers the gas mileage stinks only 18 for a 6cyl | is absurd | An Expedition gets as good | I was only getting 10 at first | I'm light footed on the gas so I dont hotdog | Im looking for a new vehicle | 
 "words": I like the way this car handles rides and looks | Great for someone like me commuting in from the Burbs every day | 
 "words": Bought mine a month ago and I love this car more and more every day | I have had no problems | It drives well feels tight great looking exterior and tasteful interior with buttons in all the right places | This is my second Ford but won't be my last | 
 "words": Traded in my 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 for the Ford Edge | Love the looks and style and do not miss my truck like I thought I would | Has a large cargo area and very fun to drive | Not to mention the better gas mileage | I was getting an average of 15 mpg with my dodge ram and according to the digital read-out on my new edge it says avg | 33 mp | So I am assuming I am getting an average of 33 mpg with it but then again I have only put 233 miles on it | Handles great in the mountains going up the hills | Very roomy interior and love all the cup holders | The lever to tilt the steering wheel is a little tough to operate keep hitting my hairclip on the headrest and the speedometer gauge is hard to see | 
 "words": All in all I think that Ford did a great job with the Edge | With modern styling and a practical design this car really is the perfect mix between a car and an SUV | I had a 2003 Ford Explorer and it drives just like it | The best part is that I didn't have to give up a lot of space | It's a great family car and the safety features that come standard are above and beyond what you'll find in most vehicles in it's class | I am really pleased with my purchase and am so glad that Ford came out with a youthful version of a practical family sadan sport utility vehicle mix | I can tote my kids around and not be embarrassed to drive it when going out with my friends | It's the best of both worlds | 
 "words": I bought the SEL Plus and traded my 2003 Expedition | We found that the space inside the Edge is a lot more than you think | We travel regularly with 4 pets and it works great for us | The styling is nice hard to believe it's a Ford | With all the incentives 0 financing you have to consider this over the Acura MDX for 47k | You'll save a ton of money and be happy with your new car too | The moonroof is amazing good powerful engine nice sight out the large front window and a huge amount of back seat room for adults to sit | We just drove it 600 miles and got about 21 mpg with it loaded down including stops and traffic | To me that's all you can ask for | 
 "words": I bought my Edge in Feb | 2007 | Bought it without a second thought or test drive | One look and I was sold | Love love love the Edge | I get many compliments on it and its a real head turner driving down the road | Ford you really did it for me this time | Have almost 6000 miles and no complaints and don't anticipate any either | I have been a Ford buyer for more than 25 years and have yet to be disappointed in anything I have gotten from Ford | I am an American and drive an American icon and couldn't be more proud | Quality is superb I have never questioned the quality of American cars | Ford will always be 1 for me | 
 "words": If you are looking for a family vehicle but don't want a minivan or full size SUV Edge is it | I've read all the reviews from major publications to googling Ford Edge reviews | Only real knock I can find are the brakes its 60-0 stop is lackluster Ford please address | All around engine is stellar 6-speed auto performs well handling nice feel but not ultra sporty ride quality the same blend of comfort not to squishy Buick Like but not Mazda like either | Test drove all others came down to CX-7 and Edge | Wanted the CX-7 to be the winner but Edge had more room easier access to rear seats ie car seats just more practical day to day | Crash test ratings can | t be beat | 
 "words": I only have a few miles on the Edge but it's easy to see it's a winner | I came back to Ford after a Chrysler van and am happy I did | The van was a nice car but the Edge is easier to drive easier to enter and exit easier to park and has much better handling | It also has much better seats and better ergonomics everywhere | The styling is uncluttered | the car looks ultra modern both in an out | The expansive sunroof is a great feature | Multiple airbags everywhere make safety a strong suit as well | It's not perfect but it's way up there in its class | I did a detailed comparison and the Edge won over the SanteFe the VeraCruz the Murano the Pacifica the Highlander and the Pilot | 
 "words": We have only had the Edge for 3 weeks and 1200 clicks but so far we are very impressed | The handling comfort and ride is excellent | I don't think we could of picked a better all around driver | 
 "words": Spent 3 months looking for CUV | Tried the Edge CRV RAV4 Pilot Outlander VUE CX-7 CX-9 | Came down to the CX- 7 the Edge | After driving them back to back the Edge came out on top | Not as sporty but V-6 feels stronger than the Turbo 4 burns regular | Vista Roof is incredible | It's like having a convertible CUV | Nav Sound system are great along with SIRIUS | Got Black Black with the 18 chrome wheels | fantastic looking vehicle just adds to great driving experience | Contrary to a magazine review I read brakes work very well | I may even buy a few shares of Ford stock the Edge is that good | Great follow-up to the Fusion Milan MKZ | Proves they can build best-in-class autos | 
 "words": I have owned this vehicle for two weeks and so far I love it | I had a Volvo XC70 and I prefer the Edge over the Volvo | The overall feel of quality is remarkable | This vehicle is smoother quieter and faster than the Volvo and has more room inside | The motor revs freely and pulls hard from a stop with the help of the close ratio 6-speed automatic | 
 "words": Got 1400 miles so far took on 800 mile trip great ridevery quiet on the road | A little disappointed in the fuel mileage 21 tops on road |

 "words": I have only had this vehicle for about a week and I am loving it already | I had an Expedition and after filling it up for the second time that week at 85 a pop I decided to look at something smaller | I thought I would miss the space of the Expedition but I really do enjoy driving the Edge | 
 "words": I have had my EDGE about 10 days | When applying the brakes it sounds like metal-on-metal just like I have gone too long without changing pads and am now riding on bare metal shoes | The dashboard lights are very dim no matter how far I turn the dial up | I'm a big guy and that isn't the Edge's fault but short trips are better on my left knee that is jammed against the side door | Right knee is okay | I drive alone so there are no passenger complaints | Gas mileage averages about 27MPG so far which is better than I thought | Will have to readjust headlight beam throw as the length of lighting comes up short high beams superb | 
 "words": This is the perfect family vehicle | It has impressive performance handling style and room inside | My Edge performs better than anything in it's class gets great mileage and is solid | V-6 is Ward's Auto 10 Best Engine | Large 2nd row seat with ample cargo room | AWD makes it even more stabile in the winter |

 "words": I had high hopes for my new 2007 Ford Edge | I really like it and it is fun to drive and I think it is very pretty | My dissipointment though is the irritating whine coming from the engine area when giving it the gas off and on | Took it to two different dealers and they compaired it to other Ford Edges and stated they all made that whine | That should not be like that

 "words": My wife and I trade in a 2006 Nissan Murano for the new Edge and have never looked back | The quality of ride and noise reduction are much greater | Then add 2 | 5 mpg improvement and the fact we don't need to put in Premium I figure we'll save two lease payments a year in gas | The Egde has gotten noticed too | Our neighbors who currently have an '05 Murano are now looking at going to the Edge once their lease is up |

 "words": I'm at just under 2000 miles and loving every minute | This is a great car | I suggest driving one and not taking some of the so called experts advice | 
 "words": This vehicle is one of the nicest 'Utility' vehicles that I've ever driven | It has a quiet and comfortable interior and the suite of luxo-goodies doesn't hurt | The engine delivers power smoothly when requested | Handling is good and adds to the fun-factor but the Edge is no sports car | It is heavy and although the Edge maintains control you feel that weight when you push the limits | Overall a pleasure to drive | I appreciate its just-right size when compared to the larger boats like the GMC Acadia | With 800 miles on mine Mileage is OK at 19 MPG |

 "words": The Edge is awesome looking on the outside but is very lacking on the interior | The interior materials are cheesy plastic and really need to be upgraded | This is a heavy truck and needs a more powerful engine | Around town it is great but highway aceleration is poor | The sound system stinks and needs an upgrade | I already miss the monsoon system I had in my VW | Ford needs to think about adding the little touches that will make this ride a true standout automatic open and close lift gate keyless entry and start sensors on the front which alert you to cars in front of you | Pretty much take all of the features found in the VW Toureg and put them in the Edge | 
 "words": After driving my new toy about 1800 miles I am loving it | It looks great inside and out | Now we are trading my wife's Expedition in next week for a second Edge | It feels safe and sturdy |

 "words": We drove the Murano before deciding on the Egde | Murano CVT simply could not decide what to do with itself very annoying | The Edge does everything very well and it is screwed together like nothing else we drove | Good vision comfortable for driver and passengers fully featured and it gets a lot of admiring looks | Maybe there is hope for the American car industry after all | 
 "words": Headed down to my Ford garage to buy my third Explorer but really didn't want to face another 5 years of sub 20 MPG at 4 | 00 per gallon | Dealer suggested trying the new Edge | After trial bought one | I have owned it for about one month and I like it | It is the only vehicle I have ever owned that people on the street turn and look at | My neighbors all came over to see the car that can drive on the edge of buildings | Haven't tried that yet | The suspension is much softer than the Explorer and other truck-based vehicles | This will take a while to get used to | I am hoping for average mileage North of 20 MPG | Too soon to tell | 
 "words": Beautiful to look at and beautiful to drive | Pewter AWD SEL-plus heavily loaded is everything I hoped for | Smooth power smooth handling | We'll see how it stands up to my heavy foot but initial indicators are all good | Except for sunroof which rattles in the open position |

 "words": After waiting 4 weeks for our Edge to come we are totally thrilled by the ride comfort and the powerful V6 | Ford job well done | 
 "words": I traded in a 2006 Fusion SEL V-6 to get the Edge | The Edge has the engine ride and style that I wanted | There is the room I need with a child and a dog | Great looks people stop me in parking lots to ask about it and look inside | They say it looks like a Lexus | All in all it is just what we need and want in a CUV | Also it's very fun to drive | I knew I would miss the Fusion but the Edge fills the bill and than some |

 "words": Bought in Feb '07 and have found it to be a great vehicle fun to drive and very roomy | Ford all around did a nice job for a 1st year vehicle and entrance into a new market | Looked at Toyota Highlander and Saturn Outlook | Even looked at a couple of vans and went with the Edge | Mileage is OK | I'm now getting 17 | 3 around town but you have to let the mileage calculation span over a couple of tanks of gas to get a more accurate reading | I would definetely recommend seriously considering it if you're in the market for new vehicle | 
 "words": I love it | The gas mileage is right where I need it | The style makes me feel young but the amount of space inside allows my kids to comfortably be transported from game to game with friends | 
 "words": Don't believe me do you | Most people don't know that Ford owns Range Rover | Many times I rode in my friend'd 80k Rover and salivated | Then I drove the Edge and oh my gosh | I felt right back in the Rover | Same wheel stereo ride feel stiffness and power | It's even faster than a BMW X5 | It is also the first Ford to appear prestigious in all manner of profiles | Nav and XM are also perfect just lacked Bluetooth | Oh and the entire back seat reclines so far back that Hulk Hogan could side cross his legs | Folding front seat into a table-esque platform makes it a limo and the center console can conceal an entire laptop | Perfect just perfect | 
 "words": After looking at the Honda CRV the Mazda CX-7 the Pontac Torrent and the Mercury Mariner I decided to go drive an Edge | That was all it took | The Mazda had a bit more zip due to its turbocharger but really lacked for room inside and towing capacity was not there | The Edge is much roomier than the Mazda not as roomy as the CRV | The CRV was a really nice ride but only had 166HP and didn't have the zip I wanted even on the interstate | This vehicle is by far the most fun to drive of any I've ever owned | The only thing I do not like is the headrest is at an angle which is somewhat uncomfortable on long rides and I think they are a smidge overpriced | 
 "words": I had been looking at CUV's for some time and then I test drove this car | My drive was mostly on the freeway and I was shocked at the outstanding ride | Bought one on the spot | Have since gone on two short trips and could not be happier | Beautiful exterior topped only by the interior | Vista roof is amazing | Love the 18 chrome wheels | Mileage could be better but this car is by far the best in this class | You owe it to yourself to test drive the Edge and make sure you take it on the freeway as it just glides down the road | 
 "words": I took an Acadia home overnight and after nearly 150 miles I could tell it was nowhere near the advertised mileage | I drove a similarly equipped Edge and thought for approximately 2K less it was the better of the two vehicles | The transmission is smoother and even though it doesn't shift up and down with the buttons the engine braking feature on O D lockout is much better than on older Ford vehicles | The vehicle is fun to drive and has a much more comfortable driving postion over my Honda Pilot thanks to a more comfortable seat and the telescoping wheel | I was getting over 26 MPG on a trip on the interstate and am getting around 21-22 on the mountainous roads I drive daily to work
 "words": Okay it might be a bit early to jump to such wild assumptions but I love this vehicle | Not seeing a lot of them yet out here so I get the What kind of car is that question followed by no way that is a Ford | So the ego of course is inflated but driving this thing is where you will fall in love | On ramps with all four wheels pulling are instant smile makers | Stomp the accelerator at 65 and feel yourself pulled back in the seat when the auto tranny smoothly downshifts to 3rd and 5500 rpms and you rocket past that pain hovering at 65 in the left lane | I thought my 525 would always be my favorite driver but the Edge has made that a distant memory | 
 "words": I have owned my 2007 Ford Edge for 2 weeks and absolutely LOVE it | Supposedly the first version of the CUV was the 1996 Toyota RAV4 which I traded in for the Edge | People who see me and my new Edge think it's sexy | I think they are referring to the 6 speed automatic 265 horsepower or maybe they are referring to the modern design | Either way my new Edge is comfortable stylish capable and gets 24 mpg | 
 "words": I was not sure when I first got it but within a day grew to love to drive it | Seats high and comfortable Love the larger armrest storage | MPG is a little better than most in its class | Drives great | 
 "words": Although I've only driven 800 miles the Edge is a superior automobile to my 2002 Escape | I truly believe that Ford hit a home run | 
 "words": I love my EDGE | It is fun sporty and elegant all at the same time | Although the gas mileage is not what they say | After 2 months I only get 14 miles to the gallon city but that's still better than most cars today | I would not trade my EDGE for any other crossover in the world | I test drove all other crossovers made and this one has just that extra EDGE | 
 "words": I as many others was very skeptical about Ford's first real crossover | Freestyle doesn't really count | I test drove it as well as the GMC Acadia | What it came down to for me was the lease deal | Ford is pushing the Edge pretty hard and the lease interest rate I got was | 75 | That pretty much sealed the deal for me | But once I started driving it I was totally blown away | First off the drive is super smooth and quiet | It's quick and relatively agile | Bottom line | FUN | The interior has some minor lower quality plastics but the overall quality is very good | The leather seats are very high quality and look and feel terrific | Overall this CUV seems to be a home run | 
 "words": I have been caught in two snow storms since the purchase of my Edge | I must tell you it handled great | In dry conditions the ride on the highway is very smooth and plush | The feel of a high end luxurious vehicle | 
 "words": I wanted an SUV that had the comfort of a nice car and this fit the bill | It's a very smooth ride and ultra quiet at any speed | It handles like a dream in snow with the traction control | The 265 HP engine really accelerates like a sporty car | 
 "words": We had to wait to get the color and features we wanted but it was worth it | Outside the CSUV is a head turner and the inside has a great balance of usable features comfort style and a massive Vista roof | We drove the Nissan and Mazda and they couldn | t compare to the great ride afforded by the Edge | The Edge also beats the others with better all around quality on the exterior and interior | The powerfully matched engine and transmission really sets it apart from the Nissan and the Mazda | Great looks great performance and a good price | What a fun vehicle to drive | Too bad it | s my wife | s | 
 "words": This Edge was my first Ford and first SUV | In the past I | ve owned traditional 4-door cars unusually foreign made | I don | t think it | s possible for me to express how happy I am with this Edge | The ride is smooth and very comfortable and it has a great 3 | 5 V6 paired with a smooth 6 speed transmission | I test drove the new 2007 Outlander which couldn | t hold a candle to this new Edge | 
 "words": I was very skeptical about buying the edge with all the reviews so I checked for myself | The ride is great the braking is better than my Explorer | We've had it for about a month now and couldn't be happier | Everywhere I go people ask we what is that | All of my friends want to ride in it | 
 "words": This car is fun to drive | I use the navigation system constantly with my line of work | Open and airy | I constantly get comments about how nice the car looks | Handles great in the snow | Very fast and sport | Absolutely love this car | I almost bought another Ford Escape but changed my mind at the last minute now I am glad I did | Great job Ford once again | 
 "words": I has been a die-hard import car lover | My old car was Toyota Highlander but didn't like the style and the engine was terrible | My friend recommend to check out the Edge | At first I was hesitant but as soon as I test drove one I was very surprised at the fun-to-drive capability and the style | I didn't know Ford has this kind of a car before | I like the huge sunroof Vistaroof | and the ample center console | The 2nd row seats are folded just by a touch of a button which is awesome | Hey if somebody was like me driving only imports please check this car out | You'll know what I'm saying | 
 "words": I looked at cars for 1 year and I'm glad I waited | Looked at the Edge Mazda CX-7 CX-9 and Nissan Murano and many many more | Nissan and Mazda wouldn't negotiate price | Ford did two 500 rebates 3 | 9 financing and near invoice price and that sealed the deal In my case | Safety features are excellent ride comfortable well planted and quiet with plenty of power | For example drove at high speed and pushed the pedal and quickly went higher with easily more to spare | Transmission shifts silky smooth | I never owned a Ford before but am glad I considered them | I recommend that you do the same if you are considering a crossover | I rented an Edge for 3 days before buying | 
 "words": What a vehicle | Spacious comfortable sharp looking quiet ride and from early experience it appears to be built well with solid craftsmanship | The Edge is well designed in the cab allowing easy access to the controls and giving each of the passengers ample room and drink storage | The exterior design is certainly a head turner especially when you equip the vehicle with the 18 wheels which come standard on this trim line | My Edge is black with the camel leather interior it looks great | So far the performance of the engine and transmission has been flawless | The 6 speed automatic shifts smoothly and allows me to cruise at high speeds at only 1500- 1700 rpms | 
 "words": I've been driving a midsize SUV and been waiting for this kind of fuel efficient crossover long time | Test-drove Murano but heck it's too overpriced | Finally I test drove an Edge and just I was sold to it | The fuel economy is much better than I expected and the vista roof gives me a huge view to the sky which is terrific | So nice looking outside and very BIG inside | The inside space is one of my favorites | The gauges and controls are convenient and friendly | V6 and auto go very well together | I love to drive my Edge everyday | It's fun to drive | The trunk space is also very generous and 2nd row seat is big enough for my 6' 5 son | 18 tire is a good idea too |
