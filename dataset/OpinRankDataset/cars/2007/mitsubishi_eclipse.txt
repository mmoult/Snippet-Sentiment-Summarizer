REVIEWS
 "words": I love this car it is wonderful | Stylish fast and just great | The only problem is they don't tell you how fast it depreciates | I bought it new and it's not worth a quarter of what I am still paying | So I do recommend buying a used or older year | 
 "words": The negatives on this vehicle are interior space | Hardly any back seat | Not good for extremely tall people | I am 6'4 and fit very snugly | Worst is severe blind spots | Very low to the ground | Handles very well | Average fuel economy for 4 cyl | Decent acceleration power | Always been reliable | Speaker in trunk eliminates some storage space | 
 "words": The 2007 eclipse has 2 problems some of the models sunroofs do not open all the way mine does not and my air conditioner has not worked properly and the dealership does not resolve my issue only makes excuses | I will not buy another Mitsubishi | their engineers do a poor job in my opinion and that of the service rep I spoke with | BEWARE |

 "words": Bought the car back in November | Traded in a 07 Mustang for it and I'm glad I did | The car is pretty peppy for an inline 4 and gets great gas mileage I usually averaged about 30 mpg | It has a cool design and interesting interior | It's also pretty comfortable as well | I did however wreck mine about 3 weeks ago and totaled it | It held up very well but the airbags didn't deploy strangely enough | Overall I liked the car and would recommend it for someone who is looking for an affordable sporty car that gets good gas mileage |

 "words": I traded in a Dodge Dakota because I wanted a sportier vehicle | I did my research and after comparing the Mustang RX-8 Civic-Si and Eclipse it was my favorite | I have had it about a month now and it is the best car I have ever owned | It's flashy fast hauls my golf clubs and makes mundane trips to work a lot more exciting | It is an excellent medium between a full on performance car and a livable daily commuting or touring car | The stereo is ridiculous | I didn't know you could get a stereo that sounds that good from the factory | 
 "words": Bought mine used with 17000 miles on it | I was just looking for an everyday runner and this car was available | Simply unbelievable | I never even looked at Mitsubishi before but it's true that they've thought of everything | I have the convertible GT V6 and this baby is a runner alright | Previous owner put a carbon fiber hood on her 20-inch black spoke wheels an air induction system to increase her horsepower and all the options | Wow | She's amazing | The ride is incredible the look is amazing and the officer who pulled up alongside of me to tell me I was going too fast even gave me a thumbs up and a wave | And my golf clubs fit in the trunk | You won't be disappointed | 
 "words": I looked for a very long time to get this car | I bought it with the Rockford stereo which was a must and complete with all the options | I was reluctant at first to buy any car with a 4 cylinder but was very satisfied after driving mine | It did not take long to figure out that it has an amazing ride as well as all the power and handling anyone could ask for | This will not be my last Mitsubishi I promise you that | 
 "words": Well i went to buy a Tibron but end up with 07 Eclipse Nice Car First time own a 2dr | Sport like car | It's not really a Sports car but its act like it | Sound System design Wheels All around is good car | I did some long trips and very comfortable | It has more room then TC Tibron for back seats and really its an Head turner | I bought in 4 cyl | wish bought it in 6 cyl | and 6 speed Manual | Next Time | So if you like style Modifications Oh yes | Forget about Honda Toyota Get this one with 10 years of warranty | wowo | see you around | 
 "words": I purchased this car brand new off the lot in 2006 | I have been driving it for two years now and would not give it up for the world | I love the comfort sportiness and sexiness it gives me on the road | The power is excellent for a four cylinder although I do notice a sluggish start when running the A C on high from a dead stop | Long distance drives have not left me with the numb butt feeling | That was a plus | I average about 28-30 mpg in town if driving casually | If I romp on it I can almost see my gas gauge move | Driver tendencies depend on gas mileage | I love the interior although the driver side door could have an elbow rest a little higher | Absolutely great car | 
 "words": Overall the car is gorgeous and reliable | It's heavy and built solid like a tank which makes me feel safe | The sound system is FANTASTIC | It's fun to drive and I always get lots of looks when I'm out and about in it | Luckily I'm short so the car offers me lots of room | I hauled a 32 inch 100 lb tv in the trunk 220 miles to my brothers and had room left over for my luggage and dvd player | It's all in how you pack your cargo | 
 "words": This is a really fun car to drive | Great body style super sound system pretty good gas mileage | 
 "words": Purchased as a first car for my daughter but I'm driving it more than she | Every time I drive it I'm more impressed | Today I drove a combination of interstate and U | S | Rt 1 from Richmond VA to D | C | in heavy downpours and lots of standing water with my wife and daughter onboard and felt in control at all times | Always looking for an excuse to drive | Peppy sporty ride and handling great braking tight steering just overall fun to drive | Lots of compliments on styling with the sunset color | Weird because I was looking for BMWs when my daughter talked me into driving it | The price was 500 more than Kelley Blue Book TRADE IN with the balance of a 6 year 60000 mile warranty | 
 "words": Although I haven't bought the car yet I have to say the two days I test drove it I was so impressed | I currently own a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am and have always loved the sportier cars and have to say the Eclipse is pretty amazing | The get up and go is awesome def | more torque than my grand am and the sound system is pretty awesome too | I'm getting the green silver blue color and think it's a very classy choice | 
 "words": From the day I bought the car I just liked it not loved it | I didn't buy it for the gas mileage so I wasn't expecting good mileage | The power was fun manual makes it better but I notice all the other things like the blind spot rough ride and road noise | To top it off when I took the car in for a shimmy while braking I was told that it is normal for the rotors to have to be resurfaced every 10000 miles | So have fun with the car just don't use the brakes | 
 "words": I bought this car used with only 15000 miles on it | Used to be a rental | I absolutely love the body | The interior is great mostly at night with the blue interior lights | The car draws lots of attention thank God this comes standard with security | Surprised to find such power in a 4 cylinder | I test drove a 6 cylinder the extra pick up was better but not enough to make me want it | The 6 also requires premium gas and when purchasing this gas was definitely an issue | The gas mileage is okay if you're not running and gunning | I love the way the engine sounds and the handling is pretty good | I like the fact that there is more room than in the older models | 
 "words": Love the car | Sexy style fun to drive hot sound system what's not to like | If you are thinking about getting one just do it | I am 6 feet tall and there's enough room | 
 "words": This is my commuter mobile | It has plenty of power and torque despite it's a 4 cylinder engine | Plenty of interior room for front seats but the rear seats are not for people just extra storage space | You get a lot of car for its price style and performance compared to its competitors | 
 "words": This is my 4th eclipse Mitsubishi knows what they are doing | They make the vast improvements with the vehicle years | This model pretty much takes the best of every body style and puts it into a powerful reliable well controlled tank | This car is for the price the best buy for the buck | 
 "words": I love this car | It's not as sporty as G1 G2 Eclipses though it traded some of its sportiness to a true everyday comfort and that was a square deal | It's still fun to drive either it's mountain Colorado roads everyday commute or 2000 miles vacation trip to Yellowstone | Ride is smooth but you have all the control through the corners you can expect from a n Eclipse | V6 gives more than enough power for civic roads thanks Mitsubishi for standard stability control | In its price range Eclipse GT has no close competitors you'll get most for your money | 
 "words": For the price I paid for this car I think it was the best on the market | As far as toys and looks go it is a very very good car | If you are not planning to race around professionally the performance is good enough for you and the stereo system design etc | makes the car look more expensive than it actually is | 
 "words": This is my first Eclipse and I love it | I get so many comments from so many people and it feels good | I wish the car was lighter and had dual overhead cams instead of a single because I'm 24 and I like to have a lot of power but with modifications it could be a power house | Over all I love the car the feel of it on the road the inspirated racing seats the blue gauges astound me every time | This is a very fun car to drive and fun to look at its a real eye catcher | 
 "words": This is a classy car | Eclipse SE 2 | 4ltr automatic black | The 18 alloy wheels on this beautifully wide coupe make a driver feel secure especially in bad driving conditions as well as make you look good while driving | lol | Very smooth ride | I've only had this vehicle for a few days | Although I researched my options with other makes and models prior to this decision I must admit I'm very pleased | 
 "words": Some people don't like this car because it's a V6 and front wheel drive but it doesn't matter what they think when I'm passing Mustangs with their V8s | This car doesn't only look fast it can back it up | If you don't regularly drive more than 1 person you should be fine otherwise it might be an issue with the back legroom being absent | But the interior is great displays all blue at night has sunroof 6 disc rockford phosgate system displays the temp cd track and time | I'm very pleased with this car | 
 "words": I love the color that I got | The car is pretty quick for a GS | I like the style of the body and most definitely love the interior light | I love the sub they included and plan on putting in my own | 
 "words": Love absolutely everything about the 2007 Eclipse GT | The design is the best | It is extremely fun to drive | It sticks to the road like glue | It is very good in winter driving | This car is absolutely comfortable and FUN to drive | 
 "words": The 2007 Eclipse is an awesome ride | It has the styling of a small speedster the beauty of a classic sports hatchback and the get up and goes of a roadster | The 6-cyl | 24 valve 263 HP engine provide plenty of power to rock the road | Do not hesitate to take it for long drives | The car hugs the road with my all season Toyo Proxes FZ-4 | Its ride is very comfortable 
 "words": The 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse GT Coupe is a joy | It's very fast and fun to drive | 
 "words": This is the first two seater I've ever owned | I had always driven sedans | This car is a good value | Its styling is to my taste and the interior design is well thought out | This car is enjoyable to drive although not a high performance sports car by any measure | I am getting 27 plus miles to the gallon with only 2000 miles on car so far | I am still adapting to the driver's seat | It took me one month to find a comfortable driving position | Getting used to the passenger side blind spot is no big deal | 
 "words": I don't understand the poor reviews of this vehicle by the so-called experts | I drove several cars Mustangs 2 Miatas 2 Honda Civic Si RX-8 Solstice Corvettes 2 | While this car is no Corvette frankly the Corvettes were too much car for me it is a lot of fun to drive | In fact given legal speed limits I would say it allows one to jump on the gas and still remain at reasonable speeds i | e | you can actually utilize what the car offers | And I liked it much better than the Honda Civic Si which all the experts rave about | If you're looking for a reasonably priced car and don't plan on limiting your driving to pushing the car to the max on an oval it's worth trying | 
 "words": This is my third Eclipse and its flair seemed to fade less than two months after purchase | Its fuel economy rating is not even close to its EPA estimates though | I enjoyed my 1994 and 2002 models much more and am look to trade this gas guzzler before the end of the year | The styling is truly unique so unique that it will be out of style faster than ever | The special aero kit required three adjustments and because it is difficult to see the front and back end scraping curbs are unavoidable | The steering and brakes are great and so is the acceleration but like an amusement park ride it is time to leave for something else | 
 "words": This is the second car of this style I've had | The first was an Eagle Talon | It is fun to drive | I love the feel it's like scooting along on the highway | Its gas mileage is great if you don't drive like a high school kid | The looks can't be beaten for the price | 
 "words": This car is very fun to drive | The sportronic transmission resembles a ratchet shifter for an early model hot rod or muscle car in efficiency and the low-end stereo is quite sufficient for for most people | I only wish there was performance enhancers to make it that much faster | 
 "words": The 2007 Eclipse is a dream car | It has the styling of a small speedster the beauty of a classic sports hatchback and the get up and go of a roadster | The 6-cyl | 14 valve 260 HP engine provide plenty of power to rock the road | Do not hestitate to take it for long drives | The car hugs the road | Its ride is very comfortable and there is plenty of room for luggage the dog the cooler and the golf clubs | Whether you go with the hard top with the sunroof or the convertible Spyder you cannot make a bad choice here | I was set on a two seat roadster so I drove the Solstice the Sky the RX-8 and the G6 | The Eclipse won the day | There is no need to spend your life savings you can have it all with the Eclipse | 
 "words": After testing driving the Scion tC Honda Civic and the Ford Mustang V6 I test drove and purchased an Eclipse GS | While it is more expensive than the Scion and the Honda I felt the Eclipse delivered more value | It has better acceleration than the Scion or Honda has more comfortable seats has a better interior layout and a has much better exterior design | I did like the Mustang's exterior design but it's interior seemed cheap and poorly laid out | Overall the Mustang which was more expensive than the Eclipse just didn't seem to offer as much value | 
 "words": Well I've had my '07 Eclipse GS for about three months now so I think I have a good enough feel for the pros and cons to rate this car and give it a review | First of all the car looks GREAT | The design on the exterior is so innovative and curvy | The interior is a beautiful blue color at night thanks to the little blue LED lights inside the dash | However the plastic on the doors and other parts of the interior IS CHEAP | I barely knick the door and there's a scratch | I can't have anyone sit in the back if there wearing heels because I am afraid they might scratch the plastic | I really hate the fear of scratching my plastic every time I take a ride but over all the car is nice | 
 "words": The 2007 Eclispe is the best car I have ever driven at the ripe old age of 45 | I love the handling the sylish look as well as the speed of a 4-banger | I feel young and get the young ladies looking | 
 "words": I went through a major transition getting my Eclipse | I had an '01 Grand AM SE before this | Needless to say I like the Eclipse much much better | I have not even tested it fully but the handling is great and it doesn't take much to get it moving | 
 "words": My wife and I were searching for a sporty car that gets decent gas milage at an affordable price | The '07 Eclipse fits the bill very nicely | We love the new body styling | It had always been my dream to own a Porsche 911 someday | But let's face it the average person will never be able to afford that | You can get a similar look for 1 4 of the price with the new Eclipse | The performance of the 4-cylinder engine is really suprising | It has plenty of power for the average driver | We took it for a 150 miles trip down the Blue Ridge Parkway this past weekend and it ran and handled like a dream | I am 6' 3 and weigh 220 at 52 yrs old | I can get in and out of the car with no problems | 
 "words": This is my first new car purchase and so far I'm really loving this car | The exterior styling is gorgeous and the interior is in two words simple elegance not too overly done but eye catching none the less | The front seats are very comfy but the back seat is small with no leg room but that doesn't bother me since I don't sit back there | It's got a peppy engine for a 4-cyl | but does get a little sluggish with the A C on in my opinion | It takes turns like nothing and the the brakes are also wonderful It it the best vehicle I've ever experienced | The Rockford Fosgate sterio is killer a MUST have | All around I adore this car and it's a huge step up from my '01 Grand Am | Buy one youu'll love it | 
 "words": On a long trip or short hop the 2007 Eclipse is just pure fun | I lose few stereo wars with its Fosgate 650W stereo and no off the line acceleration | It is almost on par with the 2006 Mustang GT which is faster than their previous GT | I also looked at the Nissan 300Z and Mazda RX-8 | They are overpriced for what you get | The 2006 'Stang GT is also overpriced when you compare it to the Eclipse's features side by side and plus everyone has one | This car is also a real head turner | I have been on eleven hour straight drives up steep mountain passes and flat praries the car is just a pleasure to be in and has amazing power when you need it to pass | It is worry free | I also garden and can haul a couple of 1 | 7 cu ft dirt bags and many plants in one go | What a great Car | Also it eats BMW 3-Series off the line easily | 
 "words": Driving this car is very fun and pleasurable | The '07 Eclipse is a great head turner | Its styling is awesome | Road trips in it are comfortable and its performance is A-OK even with the 4-cyl | engine and the A C on | Overall the car is top notch | We are very happy owners of this vehicle | 
 "words": I Traded an '01 for the '07 Eclipse | I loved my '01 model but had to trade it in | My new car handles easily and is very sleek | The '07 Eclipse is not just for the young but for anyone | I am 61 years old I know I will love my new car as much as my old one | 
 "words": I bought the Eclipse GS model last week and it is a fun to drive car | Its Sportronic transmission it makes you feel in control of the car | Its acceleration is good for a 4-cylinder and it is a good looking car inside and out | The road handling is very good and makes tring to get more out of the car | So far it is a very good choice | 
 "words": My Blue Eclipse GS model is not bad for those looking to drive and have fun at the same time | It is really nice around the corners and it has a smooth ride | It gets people's attention when crusing the streets | Also the guages are really nice to look at when checking your speed | The seats are comfy too | 
 "words": I love my car | This is my second Eclipse I traded my '03 model for the '07 and I have no regrets | I am always getting compliments on my car | If you don't want to be noticed this is not the car for you | I can't even pump gas into my car without someone coming up to talk to me about it | If you are looking for a family car this is also not the car for you | The backseat serves no purpose other than to put a purse on it when I have a passenger but then again I bought the car for me and being 18 backseats aren't important to me | Foglights are also a must because it makes the car look better and not so cheap with the black plastic inserts | 
 "words": If you drive a 2007 Eclipse you are in for a surprise | This is the car that will put Mitsubishi on the map again | It has great looks it is fun to drive and it has plenty of power to go arround | 
 "words": Just traded my low mileage 2004 Spyder in on the new one I now have the Sunset Pearlescence colored GT with the Sportstronic transmission which lets you drive as an automatic AND OR a five speed manual transmission | Initially I was worried about the trade as I was crazy about my 2004 Spyder | But after having the 2007 for a few days all my concerns have been eased | The 2007 handles better rides better looks more like a luxury car and turns heads more than the previous style | I think I'm going to be a happy camper-so far so good |
