REVIEWS
 "words": Test drove and researched reviews and maintenance histories of the big three and settled on the Chevy to pull my 5th Wheel | I'm so impressed that I'm taking the time to post this review and like other reviewers I have nothing but praise for the Duramax Allison pwertrain quiet and dependable this is one towing beast | Pulled my 14000 lb trailer coast-to- coast up and over the White Mountains while passing cars climbing the hills | While the comment about acres of plastic is true and I find the exterior styling less appealing than similar Fords I bought it to haul and stay out of the shop and it does both better than the competition | This is a great truck | 
 "words": After much discussion between gas and diesel we went with the Duramax | Just awesome is all I can say | We just pulled a 4 horse trailer cross country 9 days and 6500 miles later my back was not even sore from the ride | Engine never slowed across any of the mountains | Plenty of room to lay out in the back and sleep while trading off driving | I revamped some built in headrest dvd players from an H3 and they look great | Should be an option | 
 "words": Purchased to pull a trailer and love it so much it has become my daily driver | It has plenty of power and fuel mileage is acceptable due to the diesel and Allison 6 speed transmission | I live in snow country and the 4wd heated seats defrosters are all excellent | 
 "words": Great riding and driving truck | Can handle the occassional work load well | Good reliabilty | The new six speed automatic transmission is a dissappointment | I currently still own a 2500hd classic with the old 4 speed automatic trans and under similar driving conditions cosistently gets 3 | 1 miles per gallon better fuel economy | I would have expected the 6 speed to get better fuel economy than the old one | 
 "words": Just traded a Dodge 1500 Hemi for this 2007 2500HD with the Vortec 8100 and Allison six speed automatic | Wow this thing really goes | It is better than the old 454 engine | I needed a lot of pulling capacity but did not need the expense of the DuraMax this really fills the need | Gas mileage is about 12 | 5 mpg around town and 14 | 5 on the highway and it loves regular gas | Drivers seat is much better than the Dodge was | Steering is not quite as good seems to wander at high speeds | Could be the E load tires compared to the 20 tires on the Dodge | Attention Dodge owners Chevy dealers will not give you anything on trade if you have a 05-07 Dodge | Overall very strong truck | 
 "words": Duramax w Allison Trans is the way to go | I regularly pull a 13 | 5K fifth wheel and sometimes forget it is back there | Rides better than my SUV gets better fuel economy gotta love a diesel and has all the same creature comforts | I would definitely buy again although I'm thinking I won't have to | 
 "words": I just got this 2500HD with the 6 | 0 gas engine and I love it | Even though this is the basic W T version it gives me plenty of cash to play with to make changes | Ride is great for a 3 4 ton even with E tires | Interior is nice and I enjoy having the 40 20 40 bench seat | Easy to clean just like my wife's Element with the vinyl flooring not missing the carpet | Just added a performance exhaust and love the sound and launch | FYI I've been driving diesels for the last 8 years and loved them but missed the raw power of the gas engine | Trade-off is the low mileage though but loads of fun to drive and cheap to insure | 
 "words": This is the nicest truck on the road hands down | I test drove all 3 competitors Ford Dodge and Chevy and Chevy takes the cake | The ride is superior engine is loud like the powerstroke and cummins more HP365 and more torque 660 lbs very roomy and comfortable | Just needs bigger tires | Price is more and I could of got a diesel for 40 grand but hey 45 grand for a Chevy and that truck is worth it | 5 stars
 "words": This is an awesome truck | I am super impressed with the power and acceleration of the Duramax Allison combination | The ride is excellent and very quiet | The interior is not super flashy but it is very driver friendly | It also seats my family of 5 and my black lab very well Crew Cab | 
 "words": I am very impressed with this truck | It is the Duramax DieselLBZ 6 | 6l with Allison Transmission | It's solid truck that drives extremely well | It is very quiet for a diesel | My kids actually fall asleep in it when we are on the highway because it is so smooth | Although this truck has a lot of power | I like the body style but if I could change one thing it would be the tiny tires they put on this hulking truck | It really hurts the overall look of it and most buyers of this truck change them immediately anyways | 
 "words": Great truck | The ride is better than either Dodge or Ford across my dirt roads | On the highway it does not ride as well as my wife's Suburban but still much better than the other trucks I have | Handles well better than most trucks that are not sporterized | I test drove all three domestic truck lines and this was head and shoulders above the competition | Fuel mileage is low but this is probably due to the engine break in period |
