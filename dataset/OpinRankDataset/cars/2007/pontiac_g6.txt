 "words": I traded my 06 ford explorer off for a g6 because I started to get too high off mileage on my explorer and I needed something that got better gas mileage | I liked the way it looked on the outside | The inside wasn't bad at first and it drove alright | Within the first month it was in the shop three times for rotors brake pads and steering column problems | Now the silver trim is peeling off | It looked cheap on the inside to begin with but now looks even cheaper | 
 "words": Car seems to have gotten worse with more miles | I now have almost 29000 miles and I've already had to replace the brakes turn rotors AC stopped blowing recently numerous alignment and tire issues needed to get the steering column lubed now it's starting to make noise again had to have passenger side airbag sensor replaced once and serviced two other times | Unfortunately it feels like the reliability is not there | It feels like the more miles I get on the car the more things go out | Car handles well and cruises real nice at high speeds on interstate | I feel like Pontiac just threw this car together real quick | I will shop around more next time | 
 "words": I like my 2007 2 | 4l g6 it drives well and I bought it new | At 23000 miles I didn't have to do any Major repairs | I have noticed that when you turn and take off fast there is a clunking noise that is starting to annoy me | I have called the dealer and they said it must be because of the speed I'm taking off at but that's not true | 
 "words": I have owned my 07 for about a year and a half | I have had minor issues that I have taken it into the dealership but nothing major thus far | I agree with other people about the interior plastic type pieces being cheap | Other than the cheap plastic pieces it's an overall good car | The trunk space is amazing | 
 "words": I purchased this car in February '09 after trading in my '03 Chevy Impala | I'm very impressed with it so far | It had 35000 miles on it due to it being a rental car yet I haven't had any problems at all | It drives great and looks awesome | I've had GM vehicles for the past 5 years and haven't had any major problems with any of them | Now if only Ford could do the same | lol | 
 "words": This car was a piece of junk | I bought this car with only 28000 mi | The car came with its original bumper to bumper warranty | At 29000 mi I had grinding in my steering wheel 36000 mi everything really went to heck | My steering wheel once again stared making the grinding sound again | The car started to loose its power and the car started to get horrible on gas | By the time I traded it in I fill up at least 4 and to some time 4 times a week | At 38000 I had to replace the brakes and let me tell you it like rocket science to replace those brakes | At 40000 my struts were out and it was going to cost me 1200 to get them replaced | 
 "words": Purchased 4 07 | Wheel bearing replaced at 12000 miles | Now at 20000 back in the shop for clunking in the steering | Car will not stay aligned constantly fighting the steering wheel aligned 4 times | On the positive side looks good 3 | 5 engine runs well | I bought the sports package maybe that is the problem | Will still buy American probably not GM | 
 "words": For all of you who have wrote bad reviews about the car you must not know how to drive | Ive drove my 07 G6 115000mi in two years | The only two problems I had were dirty fuel injectors and the cadilac convertor was replaced | Finally after 115000 the struts are starting to go bad but thats because of all the pot holes | The car runs great looks great handles great and im thinking about upgrading to an 09 | If you have break problems with only 10000mi maybe your slamming on the brakes too much and overheating the rotors | 
 "words": Purchased brand new and started having problems safety issues from day one | Mechanical steering wiring brakes rotors engine and throttle body has gone out | Contacted gm customer service and not getting any help | Car to dangerous for me and my son to be in but now one wants to help me | 
 "words": Aside from an annoying clicking in the front windows this auto has been awesome | It took the dealer three attempts to quiet the clicking rattling window noise | It only happened with the windows all the way up and was fixed with an adjustment to the top closure which was covered in a manufacturer's bulletin | This car is fun to drive and is truly like having two cars in one with the retractable hard top | Gas mileage is excellent given the performance level | 
 "words": This is a very attractive car | It feels comfortable and sporty and with some exceptions has very nice interior | I think many of the issues with the earlier years have been sorted out | Too early to tell about reliability | My example has several interior rattles | The engine feels very powerful and the car handles well but it falls short of really being a sports coupe | I have the sport package on mine which includes the 3 | 5L LZ4 and hydraulic PS which probably resolved previous handling complaints | I probably can't complain about the mileage 28 MPG in commuter service but I still will | Stiff suspension transmits considerable road noise to the cabin ride is OK though | 
 "words": This is a great car I'm impressed and surprised | Great riding strong V6 nice clean appearance and very roomy | Wide wheel base makes this thing turn like a boat | Console and shifter area kinda awkward | Too close together | Not enough storage | Small trunk opening | Sharp looking I guess the people that stole my factory wheels thought so too | Get wheel locks | My wife was avid about not getting this or Pontiac in general had to give her her own set of keys | 
 "words": I have been looking for a HT convertible since owning the Ford Sunliner | This car is so much fun to drive and I stole it from the dealer | It is fun to drive and great with the top down | Had a rag top and you guessed it the top got cut and it rotted | So much for rag tops | Now I am so happy with my convertible and if it turns out to be lemon I don't care | I will love it anyway | My son and I love it and now he wants me to buy him one | The top movement is so smooth and no problems like the Sunliner had | Tubes switches bad

 "words": My G6 is less than a month old with only 500 miles but I love it so far | It's truly a great value | I think it looks and drives great | I'm impressed with the driver information center | I'm a little disappointed in the center console | It's roomy but doesn't have a compartment for coins minor flaw | Also I was surprised that the car does not have ABS brakes although it does have 4 wheel disc brakes | I also assumed that the radio would have the song information I forget what it's called but our 2001 Sunfire radio has it | I wish it had remote keyless entry but this is something that I will add later and I think is reasonably priced | I'm sure adding these would increase price | 
 "words": I shopped around for a new car for a year and had always considered the G6 sedan until I had the salesman showed me the convertible | All it took was looking at that sporty coupe turn into a great looking convertible with the push of a button and I knew what would be in my driveway | I love having two cars in one | When the top's up you can't even tell it's a convertible inside or out | It looks great going down the road and then I put the top down and you know that everyone is looking at it whether they want to or not | 
 "words": Wow | I got the G6 GT Convert w the 3 | 9 V6 Sport Premium Pkg adjust pedals side bags the works | I am a big man 300 6'1 and still fit well in this car | When the top is down I am even comfortable in the back seat | My wife is much shorter and with the adjust pedals and tilt tele steering wheel finds a comfortable position too | The ride and handling are great | I drive a daily round trip commute of 70 miles and this car works fine | Turn off the traction control stomp the gas and you burn the tires but this is a cruiser not a dragster | I don't have a garage and didn't think a cloth top would wear well | A steel top was my only option and Pontiac has delivered | I love this car | 
 "words": This was the very first time that I purchased a new car | I have only had the car for a week but I love this thing | It even came with free maitainance for a year | Be carefull though it drives fast with no problems | Love the red lights at night and the audio system rocks | 
 "words":  This car is one smooth ride | During the winter with my heated seats on I could probably fall asleep while driving it if I didn | t have my nice loud factory speakers going | I have friends who always say they dislike American cars but they sit and ride in the G6 and they change their mind | Panoramic sunroof is real nice it | s huge | I haven | t any problems with it in 6 months | Besides gas mileage and few minor things it | s a great buy |

 "words": I really didn't expect such a great vehicle | I've been a high volume fleet and internet manager for my Pontiac dealer for a long time but honestly I never thought I'd personally buy a G6 but it came time to buy a house and I wanted room in the budget so I got rid of my loaded up Sierra truck and got this G6 | It is a great riding car great build quality powerful I am really surprised | I've had Pontiacs in the past and never cared for them | I think theyve stepped up a notch and are a great value | I highly recommend the G6 if you want a great vehicle for your money
 "words": This is my first new car although this car is technically a used vehicle | I bought it with 12500 miles on the odometer | Overall GM has done a good job with this vehicle | For the price I couldn't have gotten a better more stylish '07 midsize vehicle | 15000 altogether and I have the V6 17in alloys and lip spoiler | I'm only 20yrs so I feel the design does a good job of apealing to a younger generation | Although I love my car a few things can be improved | I'm not a big fan of the hydraulic assisted steering not sporty at all not even as good as the '07 Carmy and that's not perfect either | GM cheaped out on the interior a little but thats nothing new | Ride quility is good though | 
 "words": We chose this car after driving the Accord and Corolla | This replaced my wife's old Sentra | While this car certainly did not have the bells and whistles that the other cars did and this was a very basic model besides there was still quite a bit to like about it | It is comfortable and roomy inside and has all the amenities for the daily commute | Bottom line is that it has been a very good car for thousands less than its competitors |

 "words": This is the most fun car we've ever driven | Push one button and you go from hard top to convertible no latches to loosen or canvas covers to snap in place the top automatically folds into the trunk in about 30 seconds | Most convertibles are quite noisy with the top up only canvas between you and road noise but this car is as quiet as any sedan when the top's up | Can't wait to tow it behind an RV and enjoy the vacation scenery from a vantage point only a convertible can provide | I have a Bluetooth phone which I can use when the top's down | There is hardly any wind noise in the front seat |
