REVIEWS
 "words": As a road warrior moving from an Acura RL to an SUV I have been very surprised at how much I have enjoyed this vehicle | I typically drive 1200 miles per week and with the exception of brake pads and tires this truck has asked for nothing but gas | On that note I have been tracking the mileage for the past 30k miles and I'm averaging 20 | 9 MPG not bad for a V8 | 
 "words": For years the 4Runner has been a popular SUV in TX | I bought a 2005 V6 SR5 and liked it but traded it in for this SE V8 so I could pull a RV travel trailer | Went with the upgraded JBL audio system and leather | Love the sunroof | The engine is a solid performer and accelerates nicely when needed | Exterior aesthetics are nice | Everyone who has ever ridden in it has been impressed | I expect to drive this well past 150K miles | 
 "words": This is my second 4Runner | I just traded in my 2000 4Runner SR5 for this used 2007 Sport model | I loved the 2000 model and it was reliable but I had to trade it in after having a catalytic converter issue | This 2007 Sport model is great | The ride is much smoother than the 2000 | The seats are more comfortable | Great stereo | Really like all the compartments and the MP3 connection | Still love the sunroof and the rear window that goes down | This SUV is solidly built with no rattles | Was originally looking for a black model but got the Mica Gray instead after seeing it | This 2007 model confirms my belief that Toyota makes the best cars at the best prices | I will drive them forever | 
 "words": If your needs are for mid size utility not just an all wheel drive sedan with a hatchback this is an excellent vehicle | It has the same motor as my Tundra did and tows almost as well | Handles the parking lots great and fit and finish are all Toyota
 "words": This vehicle is driven north of the 60th parallel | From -50 to 35 it has proven it's worth many times over | Up here our roads are so rough that it seems like your off roading every time you pull out of the driveway | Did I mention that the City of Yellowknife only does snow removal once a winter 7 months long and never plows on a pro-active basis | 
 "words": I couldn't be more happy with my choice | The 4Runner rides so well | It is so quiet and smooth and Lexus like | It seems like a luxury SUV | No problems | Best car SUV I have ever had | No issues problems or complaints | Engine is very powerful | Maybe they can make it even more powerful and with even better gas mileage | Here's hoping for miracle technology | 
 "words": This is my 4th Toyota and 2nd and last 4 Runner | The entire cab rattles | including the annoying squeaks in the dashboard | plastic on plastic rubbing | This is the first Toyota I have ever had that had rattles | I have had it 21 months and the rattles started the 6th month | I have a total of 20000 miles on it | I took it in to the Indianapolis dealership I bought it from and they told me that they were not going to be able to fix all the rattles | Are you kidding me | Next vehicle purchase will be an Acura | 
 "words": Had a 2005 Honda CRV while it was okay it rode rough felt every single bump and crack in the road so I was on a mission to find a more comfortable ride that had enough roof clearance to hold 2 large parrot cages buckled into the back seat and enough space in back for our suitcases and such | I test drove the Mazda suv-rode like the crv did loved the style of xterra but the ride was lacking also | The 4runner was the best ride | On occasion my dad or our grandson travels with us and the backseat has very limited leg room so can't say I would choose the 4runner if we had a larger family but for dh i and our feathered kids its ideal after all parrots don't need leg room | 
 "words": I traded in a 2001 SR5 4Runner which I had purchased new | The style and additional room inside and out makes this a far nicer ride than the 2001 | I am averaging 20 | 1 mpg with the majority of miles being local | This is better than the old 4Runner even though there was a boost of 30hp in the V6 engine | This is my third 4Runner and I have never experienced any problems with any of them | I see no need to ever get rid of this 07 since Toyota offers unsurpassed reliability and this 4Runner offers everything that I need | 
 "words": I had a 1999 4runner for eight trouble-free years | Wife test drove RAV-4 and Highlander and as soon as we left the lot in the 4Runner she said this is the one | Love the ride handling and gas mileage18-20 city 22-26 highway | Better MPG than the 1999 model | Looking forward to another eight years of worry free driving | Way to go Toyota | 
 "words": I have had several SUVs prior to this starting with a 2000 Mercedes ML320 which I got rid of under the lemon law | Then 2002 Envoy then 2003 Trailblazer both of which had transmission problems | 2005 I purchased 4 runner sport 6 cyl No problems | 2007 purchased 4 runner sport 8 cyl which actually does better with mpg | Not very stylish but love the comfortable drive does well in 4x handles great | ample storage in rear including room for a full size wheel chair | Just wish the dash lights were no so hard to read during the day | 
 "words": I traded in a 1998 which was a VERY good car | This one is more refined less truck like and bigger | It gets about the same miles per gallon 19 in mixed driving 24 on the highway at 55mph | No repairs after 6 months | 
 "words": Overall a good dependable vehicle | This is my 3rd 4Runner | I liked the interior of my earlier ones better | Manual controls were easier to manage while driving | I the exterior design is good | 
 "words": Love my 4Runner | I average 22 MPG and this has been fantastic in all weather | Living in a hilly part of the southern tier of NY the traction control and amenities are on par with cars costing up to 15K more | Considered the BMW X3 and it was no comparison | The interior space and comfort is fantastic for the money | I have never owned such a comfortable vehicle | Even the little features like the speed adjusting airfoil for the sunoof just make the driving experience and daily use a real pleasure | The control of the rear window is another great feature to help cabin airflow | The cargo mounted mirrors are a great help when backing up in close quarters | 
 "words": My 2007 4 Runner V-8 is getting between 19 and 22 mpg and can still give a coupe a run for the money | I am very very happy with my 4 Runner | And I've owned other SUVs in the past | Other then my 2002 Highlander I gave to my daughter this is the best one I've owned yet | I think if you take good proper care of it you too should get great results | Just my opinion | 
 "words": I wanted to wait to write a review until I had my 4Runner a year | I drive appx | 30000 per year so I needed a comfortable vehicle | My only major complaint is the handling in windy conditions | That might be inherent of this type of vehicle though | If I keep my foot out of it my gas mileage improves greatly 24 MPG | Overall I love the look and performance | 
 "words": I had a 2004 4Runner and recently crashed it into a telephone pole then through a large fence going 40 mph | I walked away with only a small scratch on my finger | The truck was completely destroyed | I was so impressed with the overall performance of the 2004 4Runner I had to get another one | So far this truck has met and exceeded all of my expectations | 
 "words": This vehicle is the best one I have ever owned | I have owned many SUVs | To list a few I have had a 1994 GMC Yukon 2006 Ford F150 1997 Toyota 4runner | All around this is the best from the snow to mountain driving | I drive many kilometers per day average 225 km a day and this is the most fun comfortable vehicle out there | 
 "words": I bought my 4runner 4 months ago after looking at and test driving several SUVs | Initially I wanted a Highlander but the dealership did not have the one I wanted in stock | They convinced me to test drive the 4runner and I was sold as soon as we drove off the lot | We live in the Northwest where there is a lot of snow and hills | This SUV handles extremely well in the snow with the traction control and stablility control | I went from a 1998 Toyota Camry which I loved but will never go back to another sedan after owning the 4runner | The over the top safety features and the way the vehicle handles make me feel very safe and in control | The only complaint I have is the stock stereo is crap | 
 "words": I really love this vehicle | My list of cars I have owned is as follows for understanding purposes Chevrolet Citation Toyota 4WD SR4 with roll bar fun | Mustang 2000 coupe For the first time since owning my toy4wd I really like driving | This vehicle owns the off-road equally with the on-road | I can go off-roading to meet up with friends to shoot shotguns or cruise for malls for the girlfriend to shop at hehe | Throw your snowboard and snow chains and gear in and go | My average MPG is min of 20 | Acceleration is great when some jerk is blocking u can actually put the pedal to the metal and get around them | My 1 gripe is the AC controls are slightly annoying | 
 "words": Replaced a 2000 Isuzu Trooper | Was going to buy a smaller vehicle but when I drove the 4Runner I was sold | Amazing ride and handling yet very capable off-road | Fuel economy for body-on-frame SUV has been very reasonable at 22-23 mpg on highway 18 mpg in town | Towing is impressive even with V-6 | Tows my 4500lb boat fairly easily | I like the fact that this is a no-bling vehicle that does what its supposed to do without excuses | 
 "words": I was on my way to buy an Acura RDX when I drove by the Toyota dealership and remembered the 4Runner | I was love at first glance | Fabulous vehicle couldn't be happier | 
 "words": One of the best vehicles I have ever owned | Really nice ride excellent quality the only complaint is the brake being too close to the accelerator |

 "words": Looking for an SUV with a little bit of everything | handling fun to drive tough reliable smart and gorgeous | Look no further | 
 "words": This 4Runner has been in the dealership 4 times for steering vibration flutter pulsing | The area Toyota technical rep has been working with the dealership to determine and fix the problem | They keep changing and re-road force balancing the tires and nothing works | They tell me that this vibration is normal for the vehicle and they are just tring to get the best set of tires that give the least vibration | It seems that it is not possible for it to be fixed | Toyota quality is not what I thought | An unhappy owner with 2000 miles | 
 "words": It was a toss up between ML 350 and the 4Runner | The MB has very poor reliability but the Toyota has no luxury options such as GPS | Sat on the fence for months until I came across a nearly new dealer demo I couldn't pass up | Very happy with it so far | It's like choosing between the hot high maintenance person or the plain all around good person | One is much easier to live with | 
 "words": Second 4Runner purchased | Incredibly well built and drives like a sports car | Made a HUGE mistake in the selection of this vehicle model stereo | The first 4Runner I owned had the JBL Synthesis 10 speaker system in it and it could blow you away | This 2006 I paid no attention and ended up with the basic head unit and basic speakers | Thousands of dollars later I have aftermarket | 
 "words": After months of research I purchased the 4Runner and couldn't be happier | The look feel and quality of the vehicle is exceptional | This is not a haul your family around SUV get a highlander if you need that | This is a true rugged go anywhere drive over anything SUV | Ride quality is exceptional for a truck based SUV gas mileage is very good as well | Resale value is through the roof and if you opt not to trade in after your term is up you can get 200k miles easy | Short of driving it off a cliff it just might outlast you | Can be a little tough getting in out for taller people but this is an off road truck not a minivan | 
 "words": We traded in an 05 Ford Supercrew for the 4Runner | The F150 was simply too long to park in our side entry garage | The 4Runner is sized just right and is easier to maneuver and park | Excellent inside and out | The interior looks and feels expensive way superior to our old Ford | It gets better mileage than the F150 but has less interior room | It's not the best family vehicle but it will have to do for now | 
 "words": After toying with several different kinds of cars trucks I chose the 4Runner and couldn't be happier | Love all the space the comfort the quietness and the strong engine | Above all I love how solid it feels | There is such a strong feeling of quality with this vehicle | 
 "words": I waited a long time to buy a 4Runner much too long | I love everything about it | Exterior has classic lines | interior is very comfortable | Love it | 
 "words": After looking at every SUV out there we decided on the 4Runner mainly because of Toyota's reliability | The back window is great if you have dogs | We love everything about the car | There is one problem that we have found when we first got the vehicle there was a constant rotten egg smell it since has gone away for the most part but is still there occasionally | We have tried different grades of gas and nothing seems to help | 
 "words": This SUV has been in the dealership 5 times for excessive vibration and rear end clunking and not been fixed yet | I've even had the Toyota technical rep look at it | The clunking in the rear end is a known defect in the SUV which according to the technical rep Toyota is not going to fix | If you get it you'll just have to live with it | We thought the vibration was fixed with a new set of tires but that ultimatly did not fix the problem | Toyota quality is not what it's advertised to be | I'd recommend looking at another companies product before buying one of these | 
 "words": Purchased in Jan | and loved it but now it's 12000 miles later | Inside is very small comfortable in the front seat means no leg room in the back | I am only 5'11 and I hit my head almost every time I get in | 3rd row seats create an even bigger blind spot | Seats aren | t too comfortable on long trips | Gas mileage is very poor when traveling at highway speeds | It's a nice SUV but not made for families we wish we would have waited for the new Highlander | 
 "words": After 6 months of reading reviews on SUVs picked the 4Runner | My second choice would have been the FJ Cruiser | Have had for 9 months and have had no problems at all | This is the first new vehicle I've owned that has not been in the shop at least 3 times the first 6 months for repairs and or adjustments | Mileage is 19 MPG city and 22 to 23 on the road | It's enjoyable to have a ride that only requires gas and oil changes | The vehicle I replaced was a 1988 S-10 Blazer purchased new | it was a great truck but the new Trail Blazers just did not impress me as being a SUV | The 4Runner is great in our Minnesota snow and ice 4-wheel drive and traction control perform well | 
 "words": This is my first SUV and this is a great choice | Refined ride great power smooth transmission and a responsive V8 make a very capable vehicle that can tow a ton handle any weather and full time 4WD make it very safe in any conditions | The steering is a bit unresponsive but once you get used to it you feel secure in it | The iterior is well made the leather seating is not as supple like some but seems to be built more for duribility | MPG is good for a V8 | I average 17 | 9 with mostly stop and go driving | 
 "words": 2700 miles and looking forward to trading it in | Good looking basic transportation | Unable to get side curtain airbags daytime running lights sunroof 4x4 3rd row seats in CA | Told these safety features weren | t necessary | In CO could get side curtain airbagsday time running lights3rd row seats w o sunroof | Opted for sunroof 3rd row only good for midgets | 10 year old Discovery handled better in tight fast paced LA traffic | 4Runner feels unsure and at times throws a few surprises driving at higher speeds | I never know how the vehicle is going to react to various road condition at freeway speeds | This is the first vehicle I | ve had this problem with | 
 "words": Purchased the 2007 4Runner because my 2001 SR5 was an incredibly reliable SUV and didn't cost me a dime to maintain other than routine work | The 2007 is better in every way | Handling freeway ride road noise dampening stereo interior comfort are all improved | As for the storage capacity what you see before buying is what you get | Most people don't need more or they would be buying a larger SUV | The 4Runner is a perfect size for its intended market | It is not designed to haul 6 passengers | The third row is a compromise for those who need extra seating for small children only | It is bonus space and shouldn't be viewed as Toyota's failure to provide adequate seating for 6 adults | 
 "words": I bought the 4Runner after looking at a LOT of other vehicles and the 4Runner was the best choice | Nothing beats Toyota's build quality and that can be seen with the 4Runner | You still see '84 4Runners on the road | Ride quality is excellent and the drive is smooth | Interior design is great too | 
 "words": This is my fourth 4Runner by my first one with a V8 | Traded my 2001 4Runner in for this one because I purchased a new camper | Love the V8 a lot of power very smooth and comfy | Pulled my 5500 lb camper in the mountains with no problems went up some steep mountain passes | That V8 is a beast | 
 "words": We are a family of six and when it comes right down to it our decision to purchase the Toyota 4Runner came down to three main components safety reliability and fuel economy | We downsized from a Ford Expedition to the 4Runner because the rising gas prices were cause for concern | Overall we do not regret our choice as there is no comparison to the quality and safety of a Toyota | We will keep our Toyota for years to come but with a family of six it will probably be relegated to our second vehicle | We find that the 4Runner will meet our needs in a pinch as a family hauler but trying to fit four children two are still in car seats is uncomfortable put politely | Next time think minivan | 
 "words": I've had my new and first 4Runner for two months and just finished two long road trips in it | The first was to Idaho 1500 miles round trip and the second was to Yosemite 700 miles round trip | What a great truck | I've previously taken my Highlander and Camry on these trips but the 4Runner is by far the most comfortable way to go | It has a great ride plenty of room and averaged between 20 and 26 mpg depending upon the terrain I was driving in I've got the 6 cylinder | Ran the air the whole time since it was middle of summer and no problems | I read all of the reviews here before I bought and they were right-on with pros and cons as I'll detail in the two sections below | I'm a fan | 
 "words": This is our first Toyota 4Runner and so far we love it | It's amazing how much reliability performance and luxury we're getting for the price | We bought it towards the end of Q1'07 when toyota was trying to beat GM in number of sales so we got a pretty good deal | Granted fuel mileage could be better but hey with all the other features we're getting we can't complain | 
 "words": This is where Toyota has spent its budget for SUVs | What a great job they've done | The transmission is silky smooth | Quiet | Nice | 
 "words": I traded a 2001 SR5 for this new LTD | The difference in feel is tremendous | The 01 was a great vehicle and never cost us any money in repairs | The 07 looks better has more front seat room and drives really tight | I don't see how Toyota can improve on this model | I kept the last one almost 6 years and I'm sure down the road I'll be buying another 4Runner | Can't beat the reliability | 
 "words": Although I only just purchased the SR5 model I love it | I previously had an 01 Explorer what a difference | The handling is much better and I can't believe that is doesn't feel truckish | So far I seem to be getting really good fuel mileage | I repeat love this SUV | 
 "words": As a Realtor I needed a vehicle that can get into interesting places regardless of weather be safe and reliable and also present a good professional image | I deliberately chose the mid-level Sport Edition I liked the larger disc brake rotors the X-REAS suspension the cloth seats and the side tube steps | We special ordered ours | I wanted the navigation system side airbags and sunroof primarily | The 4Runner is the ONLY vehicle that I've had including Jaguar Mercedes Mazda Volvo Honda and Nissan that was and has been absolutely flawless | Great driver and 4WD system | 
 "words": Pros a nice ride | Handles well with good acceleration | Cruises nicely at 65 70 mph at 2000 rpm | Avg miles per gallon 21 | 5 | No vibration of steering wheels over 2000 rpms as others have suggested | Good radio with great reception | 17 wheels a real plus | Putting the back window down decreases buffeting air when drivers window is down and sunroof open | Cons brakes a bit weak and seats are harder than my retired highlander | 
 "words": Overall a good truck better on gas than most SUVs | Downfalls are it floats on the highway a lot of blind spots especially the 3rd window and the wide panel between the 2nd and 3rd | The roof is very low or the seats are high if you have a kid in car seat expect to hit there head a few times | The trunk is so heavy and they need to add extra assistance to close it not at the end when you actually get it down | I'd love to see a dual sunroof | 
 "words": This is my 3rd Toyota 4Runner and as with the other two I am thrilled | I will probably always buy 4Runners if they continue to be as great as what I've experienced so far | 
 "words": Have owned all types of vehicles since 1950s | This is by far the best all around useful and the most fun to drive of any I have owned | It will tow 5000 lbs gets about 22 mpg huge cargo area with the seats down seats 5 and with the sunroof open and the windows open is almost as fun to drive as any vehicle I have owned | and I have owned about every make at one time or another |

 "words": I traded a 2001 4Runner SR5 for this 07 LTD | I loved the the 01 but the 07 is in a whole other class | Drives great plenty of power and the newer styling really looks outstanding | The only problem I had on the 01 was a broken antenna chain | The 07 doesn't have the external antenna so I expect the 07 will never have a problem | 
 "words": I searched for 4 weeks which is highly unusual for me for the perfect luxury mid-sized SUV | I narrowed it down to the H3 the Land Rover LR2 and the Acura RDX | I ruled out the H3 due to the reaction I got from everyone I told | The LR2 had no incentives and are ridiculous with their pricing and I was on my way to by the RDX when I passed the Toyota dealer | After seeing and driving the 4Runner there wasn't a doubt in my mind that was the one | 
 "words": I narrowed my SUV search to the Toyota 4Runner the Nissan Pathfinder and the Nissan XTerra | I chose the 4Runner because of comfort of driving and historical reliability | The 4Runner despite being on a truck frame delivers an exceptional ride | It's quiet and tight | You can just tell that it has 150 to 200K miles of driving in it | Although it was a little more expensive than the Nissans I think it was well worth it | 
 "words": I transport equine medical emergency cases pulling a large horse trailer and find the 4-Runner excellent in doing this job | With the 4x4 going out into the pastures is not a problem or worry to date that is | The only thing I do not like is the location of the electric window switches they should be located much higher to be easily accessible | Mileage is about 20hwy 17city | One other thing I don't like is the way the Toyota emblem looks | Overall this truck is great in the field and for evenings out on the town for dinner |

 "words": Took awhile to find an SUV that suited my towing needs and that I could live with day to day found it | I waited for the new Tahoe and once I drove it the decision was a no-brainer to purchase the 4Runner | Fuel mileage isn't bad either | 
 "words": We test drove the Highlander over New Years and put over 1200 miles on it | When we came back we decided on a 4Runner instead | It had a more rugged design and feel inside like an SUV should but the handling felt almost the same as the highlander built on a Camry frame | So far with almost 2500 miles on it gas mileage has not been that different either avg | 19 city 25 hwy | This is a great SUV with great standard comfort features | I would suggest looking at a different vehicle if you want a 3rd row seat though | The seats fold up along the side instead of fold flat into the floor | They can get in they way often when trying to load cargo | 
 "words": I agree with all the other reviews | The 2007 4Runner 4x4 totally rocks | everything is great | The black finish is gorgeous | By far WAY more than I expected it to be | Looked at all of the competition | This was the obvious choice |

 "words": This is my 3rd 4Runner and we are preparing to purchase another one this month | It has good power an absolute plus | Only downside is that it totally lacks any design sex appeal | This is truly minor as the drive more than makes up for it | I just wish they would offer more colors and or send the Salsa Red to south Florida | - I Love driving this vehicle |

 "words": I have a friend who owns a Cadillac and a Mercedes SUV | She let me drive when I went to visit her in New York | And I realized that my 4Runner has better performance than her cars | I was shocked as she has expensive cars and I thought mine is just the 4 Runner SUV | I am glad I have my Toyota 4 Runner | 
 "words": After only having my 4Runner for 6 months I can say it is a fun SUV to drive it handles like a car looks great runs great and is quiet except for a slight vibration effect or noise when it's windy it seems like wind blowing or buffeting against something | That comes and goes and is not annoying just a little disconcerting at first | The turning ratio is easy and good I've taken it off road 4x2 and it was fun fun fun |
