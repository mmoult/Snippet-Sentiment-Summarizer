REVIEWS
 "words": Overall the car is good much improved over our previous 2003 ML | The steering column mounted electronic shift however is a major problem which MB won't or can't fix | It is easy to think you have put it in park by pushing the button also has tendency to come out of park | My wife was run over by her ML after it failed to stay in park and rolled backwards on flat parking lot | Thus far MB has done nothing to address the problem | Since the computer drives the car it seems it would be very easy to have the computer stop the car shut down engine or otherwise give an aggressive warning when car is in gear and door opens | the little dashboard light which currently does the job is useless | 
 "words": I have this ML350 for just over two years | Juat in the past month I had three incidents with lamps | First one headlight lamp went out I replaced myself | Then two weeks later the breaklights went and the dealer had to replac the lamp and sockets | This week I had a problem with the parking light | When I had my 2002 ML320 for 5 years I only had to replace a single haed lamp | It lokks like that MB started to use cheap components in their car to save money | This is a very unhappy customer due to the inconvenience | I called MB to request they do a preventive maintenance replacing the remaining lamps | I was told they can not do it | My next car will be an American made car | 
 "words": We bought the diesel variant of the ML for the MPG and torque ratings | We have been very happy with power and the MPG | It is a turbo diesel so I knew to expect the 1-2 second lag when hitting the gas but love the punch once the power hits | I have been lucky not to experience any reliability or odd little noise issues and am thank full for that | 
 "words": After researching the MB ML500 was the only SUV that appealed to me-used for utilitarian purposes as fast cars are my preference | I am surprised at how well the MB drives | It accelerates nicely handles turns better than most SUVs I | ve driven | It | s extremely quiet has great curb appeal | I love that it | s predictable that the ride is true MB | I avg 20mpg highway and 15mpg city | I like the console control center a lot as for the clock in the center for the passenger-they can buy a watch or drive seating is comfortable on long trips | My friends have the Lexus Infiniti other than outright speed-FX is much faster-RX not so much-my M Class wins in every category-especially style | 
 "words": Let me begin by saying I am trying to love my ML350 | I have had it for 1 1 2 yrs | now | The ride is smooth and without the major and minor hiccups I'm about to explain I really try to love it | Let's begin there is a plastic rattle sound that I hear every single day while driving at low speeds on normally worn roads | can't hear it on the highway or interstate My dealership had it for four days and can't seem to fix it | Next one day while opening my back hatch a large bolt just fell out of the hatch | Of course there is the trailer hitch recall | Best of all my driver's side heated seat burned a hole in my seat and nearly caught on fire | Daughter was sitting in seat warming up between soccer games | 
 "words": Ordered this vehicle in January and did not get delivery until May | This is the only thing that disappointed about Mercedes | After almost 6 months and just over 10000 miles I have found very few shortcomings and many pleasant surprises | The most pleasant has be fuel efficiency | Overall combined mileage is right at 27 MPG | Trips up and down the east coast this summer registered almost 30 MPG both better than the ratings on the sticker | Solid construction quiet operation real luxury feel terrific acceleration and very comfortable seats among the most pleasing characteristics | Only disappointment so far is iPod integration bug which MB has promised to fix | Highly recommended | 
 "words": I just purchased the ML350 after seriously considering the Lexus RX400h and the Acura MDX | I really fell in love with the ML350's appearance and the smooth and relatively powerful ride | The interior is very comfortable and spacious and this car is a joy to ride | I will say that if navigation is a big priority to you the Acura is much better | The system is clumsy and you can't even find a Starbucks on it | But it is functional | 
 "words": My 2007 ML 500 is the best handling and riding SUV I have been in | Really enjoyable to drive corners extremely well | Seats are really comfortable | Cargo space is pretty roomy | Biggest complaint is delay in acceletration Car jumps after 1 sec or so delay when stepping on the gas | Gas mileage is terrible | Also the automatic tailgate only goes about 3 4 of the way up and so if you don't remember to push it the rest of the way up with your hand you will bang your head on it if you are more than about 5' 10which I have done about 100 times | Final complaint is navigation is very hard and slow to program especially if you are in a hurry | 
 "words": The car wanders needs to be constantly corrected the steering is dead sloppy in the center position | Steering wheel will not return to center and must be pulled back | The engine idle is rough goes up and down and causes a vibration in the cabin at the low idle point | Braking at times hits a sticking point that can be pushed through but then the brakes comes on hard and fast | At 5000 miles and multiple trips to the dealer I recieved no help from the dealer or MB USA | I asked them to purchase back the car the answer was NO My advice don't purchase this car | It is not the quality product I expected | The dealership was pompous when I tried to explain my concerns and dissatisfaction | 
 "words": This is my first SUV and my second MB my wife drives an 02 SLK | I leased my ML 320 CDI in Feb | 07 and so far I have been very impressed with the quality and workmanship of this SUV | The ML320 drives and handles well for a AW drive SUV | The performance is impressivethe diesel is super quite and the MPG is good for a vehicle this size I have been averaging 21-22 combined and 24-25 highway | I have 7000 miles on my ML and so far no problems | The only down side is the price MB needs to start offering more options as standard equipment ie Bluetooth formed mats power and heated seats moon roof | etc and a lower price so more people can afford it | I would highly recommend this SUV |

 "words": I purchased a new 2007 ML350 in April with the Premimum II and heating packages | I think the front and rear heated seats and heated steering wheel will come in handy this winter | It is alabaster white and has the sport package chrome accents and chrome running boardswith the 19 inch Rukbat six twin spoke wheels chrome door inserts etc | The car is a blast to drive and has plenty get up and go | It will corner and stop on a dime | It gets great gas mileage for the type of vehicle it is and is a definite eye catcher | I have had many compliments on it | It is my first Mercedes but not likely my last | 
 "words": The ML350 is great looking and fun to drive | I have the appearance package with the silver grille and 19 inch wheels and the tube side rails | 
 "words": I was able to find a new ML 500 with the optional AMG sports package | I love this vehicle because its styling is second to none especially with the AMG package | Unfortunately the performance is not as what I had expected | The transmission has some serious lag | It seems like it's got multiple personalities and only responds when it wants to not necessarily when you want it to | Other than the transmission there's nothing to complain about |

 "words": One great SUV | My husband and I had the 2004 ML350 for about a year | My husband was pleased with the ML350 stating it was a truck and was suppose to drive like a truck | My opinion was a little different I hated everything about the ML350 | Well | whenever the 2006 ML came out we went to the dealership to test drive | My husband was in shock with how different the ride | Of course I was sold after riding for a block | We purchased the ML500 and we are in love with the ride sleak style comforts in seating space the great speed on the highway and much much more |
