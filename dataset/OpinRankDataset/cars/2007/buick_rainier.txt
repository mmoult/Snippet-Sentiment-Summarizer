REVIEWS
 "words": Smooth and quiet ride just what you would expect from Buick | The features of am import luxury car in an SUV | 
 "words": Handles great on trips all the bells whistles you would want | Biggest complaint is with rear seats down it is difficult to access a cooler behind the driver from the passenger side | Sun visors are to small and for the price you would think it would have pull outs so when you use them as a side visor they would block the top of the drivers passengers window | Very aggravating | 
 "words": With over 17000 miles on my Rainier there have been zero problems with the vehicle | I purchased the Rainier because the seats in my 2004 LeSabre were so uncomfortable my wife could not ride in it for any distance even though we had zero problems with it over 85000 miles and still experienced 32 mpg on the highway and 22 in my commute to work | The Rainier's ride is great wind noise in minimal seating comfort is perfect I'm 6'4 and my wife is 5'6 and the towing and carrying flexibility are outstanding | While the mpg averages are less than the LeSabre I still average slightly over 22 mpg on the highway and a little over 15 mpg commuting to work | This was Buick's best kept secret | 
 "words": Have been incredibly pleased with all aspects of this SUV | The smooth and quiet of the ride are not like an SUV | Plenty of power in the I-6 | Dollar value was outstanding | It is unfortunate that Buick is not continuing the Rainier | 
 "words": We were looking at the Acacia when the dealer showed us the Rainier | The value for the Rainier was exceptional | We towed our boat on a 2000 mile excursion through the Sierras and it pulled with very little problem | Comfortable seats quiet and smooth ride | The fold back rear seat headrests help with vision when no one is riding in the back | The built in air compressor is a plus | urning radius is very tight | 
 "words": I got My Rainier by way of a factory order and toured the factory where it was made in Moraine Ohio | This vehicle is flat out awesome | It has a smooth ride and does not have a flat out truck feel at all | It's the quietest I have ever owned | I have no regrets getting this one | Just too bad Buick is dropping this model after the 2007 year ends | Things that need more publicity are DVD Navigation and Onstar Turn by Turn Navigation standard on the 2007 Buick line | Having both on the same vehicle makes long trips a breeze | The Voice control of the navigation system is a really great feature | The factory DVD Navigation can be added later with the | Delphi TNR800 | Unit from Crutchfield | 
 "words": When it was time to replace my DeVille we decided to purchase another Ranier | Now my wife and I both drive Raniers and are extremely satisfied with them | We have had no problems with the 2004 only going back to the dealer for oil changes | Hopefully we will get that same level of satisfaction from the new one | Gas mileage is not great but as advertised | We get 21 to 23 on the highway which is not bad for a heavy vehicle | Buick did cheapen the interior since 2004 with different sun visor brackets and mirrors and no overhead assist handle over the driver | They did however add the wood trimmed steering wheel and gear shifter | 
 "words": The last 3 SUV's we've owened were all Oldsmobile Bravada's which was a step above the Envoy and step below a Cadillac | When Oldsmobile closed the Buick division cloned the Bravada with the Rainier | After recently buying the Rainier we were pleasantly surprised at how beautiful this truck truly is | The ride is great performance great and totally compares to the Bravada | Buick came a long way when they created this truck | Not an old man's vehicle anymore | 
 "words": OK like most of us in my age group 40- 50 the name Buick is not a vehicle we are familiar with unless it | s a Buick Grand National an 80 | s muscle car | At least that | s the case for me | OK my parents have owned them but I thought it was an old persons car | lol but I guess all things change and after having a family myself I have become less about speed and performance and more at what | s practical and comfortable | Don | t get me wrong for a V-6 putting out an impressive 291 hp and 277 lb-ft of torque its no slouch | after looking at the Envoys I was sold on the Rainier | The Buick Rainier out classes the Envoy and rides like an upper class town car | Its the best bang for your buck | 
 "words": My husband and I love this car | The ride is incredibly smooth and the comfort is beyond those in the same price range | There is plenty of room for a family | 
 "words": The interior is very nice and the seating is comfortable | It is a very quiet ride as well | There is a lot of power with the 4 | 2L V6 | I would definitely recommend | 
 "words": The 2004 Rainier that I had rode a lot quietier | This 2007 has a wind noise starting at 35 mph and gets louder | I have had it back to 2 different dealers for this problem as suggested by GM motors | They can doing nothing at this time because of no recalls or service bulletins | It seems to me that it is the door seals on the back | Sounds like the back window is open a little on both sides
 "words": A real truck with real towing capacity yet as quiet and smooth as most luxury cars in town and on trips | Optional sound system is very good | The nav system in my 2004 was cumbersome so we left it off the new 2007 | Buick fixed the AWD system and it engages smoothly in 2007 | Competent handling for a luxury truck | Don't drive or evaluate it as a sports sedan | I used to make jokes about people who drive Buicks but this vehicle grows on you | 
 "words": I think this is a very under-rated SUV | It is so much nicer than the Envoy which is more popular | Very quiet and the fuel economy is about like everything else |
