REVIEWS
 "words": I bought this van new for my family needs | I have 27000 miles on it now and have had no problems so far | The only complaint I have is the transmission downshifting from 2nd gear to 1st gear | It has a very hard downshift that is very noticable | If feels like I'm doing damage by driving it with this condition | I started noticing it around 800 miles and thought maybe it was just breaking itself in | I took it to the dealer and they said that they could find nothing wrong with it | I personally think that they don't want to acknowledge the problem | Other than the transmission I really like the van | 
 "words": Now have just under 80000 miles | Van has been excellent | Still have original tires and brakes | Only part replaced was a rear bearing hub | Highway mileage on straight run is 26 mpg consistent 20 mpg in town | Van has been my first van ever and would easily buy another due to versatility | Have not had the transmission issues mentioned in other posts | I have zero complaints | 
 "words": This is my second Dodge Caravan and my family and I love it | I had my first one for almost 12 years and almost 200K miles with minimal problems | This one has most of the bells and whistles and I got it for 22K | a steal | I have the 3 | 8L engine and it really is more than I needed but because of the package I had no choice over the engine size | The 3 | 3 is more than enough unless you are pulling a load | Reading some of the other posts I guess that I was lucky since I have had no problems whatsoever with this van | It has a smooth and quiet ride pretty quiet interior and extremely comfortable | The stow and go seats just made it better | Overall a great family van suited for long trips | 
 "words": I love this van | I have a 1997 version of this faithful van and found this one to be much better | Mine is the quitest car I have ever owned | It is as quite as my Mercedes so I know what I'm talking about | Great car for road trips | 
 "words": Very upset | In 1 year must have been in service about 5 times | Air conditioning changed twice | Problem still continues | Radiator cap changed twice | Sill leaking lost bracket that holds rack pinion boot trans shift very hard at time 
 "words": This is the noisiest car I have ever driven | Sounds like the transmission is already in trouble after only 4000 miles and earlier | The road noise is awful | Could be the tires | Will take it back to the dealer next week but compared to my 2000 Voyager its just noisier and parts internally and externally seem flimsier | Hope they are not going back to their old poor workmanship compared to Japanese cars | 
 "words": I am happy with my 2007 Dodge Caravan SXT 4dr Minivan 3 | 3 L 6cyl 4A | Also I got lifetime powertrain warranty that no one offers out in market | Also my friend had it for 3-4 years has low maintenance cost | Compare to toyota honada you pay more get same by the way when you buy dodge help US economy not foreign county
 "words": Just the facts Vehicle bought new | enjoy driving but transmission has been problem from start | Hard shifts up and down but not 100 of time | Happened so much now that I'm picking up squeaks from the fact that the front end is jarring so much | I had rented another new vehicle in '07 from a car rental co | Enjoyed it much which cause me to desire one | I put over 5000 miles on the rental | I bought the current one new | put over 4000 miles on a trip | It started having troubles with the transmission that was noticeable at probably 500 miles | Enjoy driving it but HATE this problem | First new Chrysler product purchased ever and last | 
 "words": I love my new van | It rides so smooth | My kids love it my husband loves it | It gets awesome gas mileage | I have no complaints | I am comfortable when I go on a long road trip because I know it is very reliable | 
 "words": This is our first minivan | I love the roomy interior the styling and the seating is comfortable | However it is the noisiest car I have ever owned | Something which I believe is the passenger sliding door is rattling | But the dealer does not hear it | When you drive on a bumpy road it feels as if the car is going to fall apart | We have had it in to have the brake drums replaced due to noise and now it is making the same noise from the front | I still really like the van but I hope the dealership can find the source of the noises and rattles and fix the brakes once and for all | It only has 6500 miles on it we bought it brand new | 
 "words": Had a Honda Odyssey and it was nothing but problems | Now I have a Chrysler and I feel a lot more comfortable when I drive somewhere knowing I will not break down
 "words": This is the 5th Chrysler Dodge minivan that I have owned and the worst of the bunch | Good design intention failed execution | Radio does not get local stations transmission had to be re-programmed that would fix tranny problems also in these reviews driver's door re-aligned twice overhead console loose failed cup holder weatherstripping falling out of driver passenger window and hitting people in head failed resistor in blower control | Must say dealer is absolutely great but manufacturer built a lemon for me and will not own up to it | E-mailed Dodge web-site called them and still no satisfaction | It seems like they want to drive their customer to other makes | 
 "words": Driving and comfort not an issue the caravan performs | It's the transmission thats driving me crazy | When slowing down the tranny is trying to downshift 2nd to 1st is a real pain | The clunking or grabbing is a real nuisance | What's worse is Wellington motors is denying that Chrysler had issues with this tranny and still is selling these vans | Chrysler Canada aside from trying to give me 50 gift certs | keeps telling me their engineers are looking into it | I have been told that the fix would be there early Aug | 2007 that was moved out to the end of Sept to the new year and now I havent heard from anyone | 
 "words":  I bought a 2007 Dodge Caravan on 07- 02-07 | Transmisson was bad the day that I drove it off the lot | Have had it worked on twice by the dealership | Still have the same problem as day one | Chrysler can not fix the problem and like anything else you buy if it don't work it should be replaced | I get get mad each time I pull from my drive | Never fails that I get a hard shift | I did not buy the van to have this problem | I would like to know if Chrysler has plans to make repairs in the near future | Vehicle has learned my driving habits by now | 
 "words": We replaced a 1994 Voyager with this 2007 Caravan | The spirit is the same with a tidy wheelbase and four bucket seats but the new Caravan is smoother and quite a bit bigger inside | It is getting the same mileage about 17 mpg in short trips around town and about 24 mpg on the highway but is noticably better in acceleration despite having the same basic engine as the '94 | My wife wanted the short wheelbase minivan for its maneuverability around town and is very happy with it | I find it a pleasant car when I drive it particularly cruising down the highway | A piece of weatherstripping needed to be replaced on the front door otherwise it has been perfect so far | 
 "words": I have owned over a dozen vans in my life from every American manufacturer | This van has proven to be the most economical one | Reasonably priced to start the gas millage is decent at 23 MPG combined city hwy and Insurance cost are low | With 15k have had no issues except a less than smooth transmission downshift which the dealer says is normal | 
 "words": Minivans are the way to go for all my gear and traveling with or without family | The stow away feature is a must but lowers the van too much for bad dirt roads | What you get for the money is far beyond what a car or SUV can deliver | If they would only come up with better gas mileage | I think that a continuously variable transmission would help a lot | Also a computer assisted economy mode and maybe a smaller engine | 
 "words": My Grand Caravan is comfortable has excellent crash ratingswith plenty of room inside and has reasonable performance and economyacceleration is only adequate | I liked the safety of side air bags the rear backup alarm pretension seat belts | 
 "words": We wanted the 2008 GC or TC but excise tax in Puerto Rico is huge over 30 on top of full MSRP so when new 2007 SXT model became available at liquidation sale at under 20K we jumped at it | Nice surprise was that SXT came with additional options cruise control power driver's seat power slide door and 6 CD player we didn't expect so we paid 5K less than invoice and avoided taxes altogether and dealer drove new car over 100 miles to us where we had a mechanic verify it was new | Hot PR weather requires AC on full time so gas mileage is only three quarters expected | I'm only 6 ft | tall but still find pedals short and side door controls scrape my legs in front seats | Otherwise OK
 "words": I really enjoy the Grand Caravan SXT special edition | It seems to be roomy has a lot to offer and was a lot less money than the Honda wish we could have waited for the 2008 but very pleased with this van | 
 "words": Fun so far | Did not have a thing go wrong | Can not wait for the new van come out with a sunroof this time and more power
