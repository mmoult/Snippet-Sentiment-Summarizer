REVIEWS
 "words": I bought this after 3 BMWs and did so because service is so awful on BMWs in Southern California | Lexus service is truly amazing and so far ahead of any other car type that it is hard to believe | However this car is like driving down the road on a jello square | It handles loosely and because of the continuously variable transmission it feel like you are driving a motor boat more than a car | 
 "words": I just drove my car home last night and still have to set up all the bells and whistles but what a lot of fun just driving has been for 24 hrs | This car is smoking fast and the power is so smooth and linear it just keeps pulling until you are well over 100 | 
 "words": I migrated from an '06 Corvette C6 and was expecting a letup in performance | Not so | This car is extremely fun to drive and I am averaging around 26 mpg compared to 19 in the much-lighter Corvette | I am totally satisfied with this my first Lexus ever | 
 "words": This car rocks | Excellent style and finish with all Lexus has to offer while setting the bar on environmental responsibility for discriminating buyers | Performance is off the chart for a hybrid and I am averaging approx 27 | 5 MPG at 15000 miles | Service is Lexus excellence plus and I couldn't be happier with this vehicle | Anyone who can afford to make a vehicle purchase decision based on luxury performance and most importantly environmental impact should consider this car | 
 "words": What I wanted reliability green car sporty handling and acceleration ability to fit five passengers ultimate comfort 4 wheel drive | What I got everything but 4 wheel drive | What an amazing car | Don't be fooled by the similar appearance to other GS versions | I test drove the standard gas version of this car and found it lackluster noisy and boring | This car is totally different | It is the fastest and most powerful in the GS line up and has remarkable acceleration | It gets around 27 mpg in non performance mode too | It's an amazing blend of comfort and technology | 
 "words": Hits Car performs great lost of power and quality all over Nice features when you can use them | Clean lines Lexus legacy luxury in a sport sedan | Great car | A Misses dash usablity | Lock out when driving of features on most items song list of CDs | Only can play MP3 CDs 255 song limit NO DVD MP3 even though it is a DVD changer | Radio list remains at speed why is this so different than a CD list I have no idea | 2007 Acura MDX have it right when it comes to the Glass Dash | You can use the features as expected | Lexus Toyota has taken conservative to a new level | I hope they lighten up and come up with a software update | I'll even sign a waiver | PLEASE LEXUS fix this | 
 "words": My wife and I decided to go from 3 cars to 2 so we traded in a 2001 Accord EX V6 and a 2003 BMW M3 for the GS 450h | We ended up with a car that carries people better than the Accord performs better than the M3 really and gets better gas mileage than either we get between 26 and 27 mpg | If you drive it like a high-powered sports car it will perform like same right down to gas mileage in the teens | If you drive it like a sedan it will give you all that plus another 5 mpg | Visibility is excellent | Controls are perfect | Everybody can find a comfortable seating position | 
 "words": I understand the lack of trunk space where else to put the battery | Worst mileage is around town at 23 | best mileage 28 | 5 at avg | 75 mph on a 500 mile trip | Navigation system and electronics particularly LED interior ligthing are way ahead of competitors | This one was equipped with the collision avoidance package speed matching on cruise takes some getting used to but is easy to over ride with the gas pedal | I honestly believe you could set the cruise at 80 and head for a obstacle or wall and the system would stop the car well short of it | 
 "words": Best car I've ever owned | My wife and I fight over who drives it | Very hard to stay under 100 mph | Always looking for someone to race | 
 "words": Went to the taste of lexus event and loved the car | I traded in my 2002 LS 430 which I loved | I love the hybrid not because I am saving gas money currently getting 14 mpg due to my style of driving | It is incredibly fast and can keep up with most porsche cars | The sport transmission is amazing and the car is up to par with what I had in mind | Very sexy design but if you want to spend less money buy the GS 350 it | s only 37 less horse power | 
 "words": Have a 1998 GS 400 | Have owned leased at least 5 others since 1993 | This one does not live up to the hype | Extremely annoying feeling of gas- electric-gas kickin out etc | at speeds around 59 mph | Miniscule trunk | I am currently attempting to get out from under this Edsel | PS the mileage is really only a 4-5 mpg better than my GS 400 | 
 "words": Great handling smooth quick acceleration | Nice finishes | Small trunk | Decent back seat leg room | 
 "words": It is not a BMW 550i but it comes quite close in terms of handling | Interior materials are a bit superior to those seen in a BMW especially when it comes to sound | Given Lexus Toyota high levels of reliability this vehicle was a better choice for me | 
 "words": The performance of this car is mind-boggling | If you floor the gas while driving at 70 to 80 mph you WILL get pushed back into your seat and blow by everything else on the road | If you are over 6 feet tall you should definitely sit in a GS before purchasing especially if you tend to sit straight in your seat | I'm 6' 1 and my head touches the roof | The trunk is definitely tiny but I personally do not place large suitcases or any other significant cargo into the trunk on a daily basis so this is a non-issue | For trips to Costco or the airport we just use the other car an SUV | The navigation voice recognition takes some practice but otherwise the nav system itself is powerful
 "words": This car has a quiet engine very comfortable interior and can go from 0-60 in 5 | 2 sec | It has superior handling and excellent sound system | 
 "words": Love the acceleration and the feeling of driving a sports car while getting decent gas mileage | Have owned two other Lexus vehicles and this vehicle continues the streak of flawless fit and finish | I've gotten many compliments and a few negative comments about having a luxury hybrid | I chalk those comments up to jealousy | Gas mileage has been consistently in the 24 26 mpg range and I have a lead foot sometimes | With Virginia's tax credit this wasn't that much more expensive than the regular GS model and I get to use HOV lanes | 
 "words": This car blew my mind | I have never accelerated so fast from 70mph and in such comfort and tactile excellence | 24 mpg is great with this level of performance | Navigation is intuitive and easy to 'talk to' | The music system sounds like I'm in a concert hall | I love this car | 
 "words": Wonderful car overall | I had owned an Acura RL and BMW 5 series prior to purchasing the Hybrid GS450 only about 4 weeks ago | Downsides are small trunk space and less than predicted fuel economy so far only one tank and I got 22 MPG | the vehicle rating claims are 24-28 MPG | I find the car to be a great combination of comfort and performance | 
 "words": My experience with the Lexus GS 450h although brief has been overwhelmingly positive both in terms of performance and mileage | I drive 500 miles a week | 80 highway 20 city | I have consistently been averaging 28 mpg highway 150 mile trips 27 mpg city 5-15 mile trips | Having the minute-to-minute feedback from the gas consumption screen enables you to maximize your mpg and once you learn the correct way to drive a hybrid the fuel economy is certainly attainable if not beatable | And that includes a mixture of usual gas-hungry aggressive driving such as frequent quick accelerations such as merging from an entrance ramp and just blowing away fellow drivers when passing | 
 "words": I received one of the first Lexus GS 450h hybrid sedans | I had been driving an LS model | The GS definitely feels like a step down in luxury | I have been getting a disappointing 20-21 miles per gallon | The interior feels cramped compared to the LS | However the GS hybrid has plenty of power and is fun to drive | I would think twice before spending the extra money to get the hybrid model of this car |
