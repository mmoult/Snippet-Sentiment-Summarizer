REVIEWS
 "words": This car is just absolutely amazing | I am going to hold on to this car until it dies pretty much | It gets me where i need to go and I have no regrets for buying it | I think the people that get on here and complain about this magnificent car must have obviously been spoiled by cars such as Mercedes or Lexus | The seats are not uncomfortable and the fuel economy is a lot better than most cars | If I can drive this car 868 miles from IA to AL without complaining about uncomfortable seats then no one should | 
 "words": This car rides great and gets decent gas mileage ave 28 mph mixed and has needed only standard maintenance | Solid ride with plenty of people and cargo space and the moon roof heated seats six disk cd player with controls on the steering wheel are a nice plus | Excellent reliability for a good price | 
 "words": Fun car to drivelooks cutesporty handlinghowever seats squeak horribly since day one paint chips and scratches easilyinterior doesn't hold up well-seats and dash trimgas mileage- max 28mpg hwy driving no more than 65 mph | would love to know how others are getting 30 mpg as they say they are | Don't think its possible not even using cruise control Have already replaced catalytic converter and rear main seal at 30000 | Heater has rattling noise that no one can seem to figure out what it is | Has alot of road noise | Would rather own another accord or camry for sure | This car is more comparable with a corolla or civic | Not as impressed with it as salesman was | 
 "words": I still love this car | Only complaint is I've needed two alignments and gotta but new tires now | Breakaway mirrors and a bit better gas mileage would have been nice | But other than those quibbles the comfort and handling and the sheer fun of driving remains exceptional | So much cooler than all the Camry's and Accord's out there | Really sad Mazda ended the hatchback line in 07 big mistake | That rear space is so convenient for hauling stuff and the hatchback actually looks better than the Sedan IMO | I'd definitely buy this car again | 
 "words": Had the car for 15 months 22K miles | Very comfortable nice interior layout good visibility nice options for the price | Sporty handling but large turning radius | Engine idles a bit rough smooth while driving decent power good gas mileage average 28 MPG in mixed driving | Excellent brakes trunk and fold down rear seats | Only problem- steering creaks when going slow-dealer said not a safety issue greased fittings per tech bulletin seems better | 
 "words": I like quirky cars and this one fits the bill perfectly | It's not an annoying car just different | The 3 | 0L V6 is not as strong as you would think down low but the car asks you to drive it in a higher rev range | Driving the car higher in the rev range doesn't screw up the fuel economy very much | Gotta love the huge hatch opening | My only gripe is the weird front seats the have too much thigh support for us manual drivers | Yeah and the shifter itself is slightly clunky but it performs flawlessly | 
 "words": I have owned Hondas VWs a Peugeot and a Mazda GLC | If I had the cash I would buy a GTI or BMW but the 6 is a nice affordable alternative | Good handling and the 2 | 3 with a stick has enough power to be interesting | The hatch is what sold me | Room for skis and a couiple of bikes | Good car on snow and ice | I put on minus one 16 inch wheels Nokia studded snows | Use the standard 17's in the summer | Like a lot of cars today there is lack of tie down hooks on the frame which make it diffcult to pull out of a ditch 
 "words": Overall my Mazda has done everything and more | The long trips and are comfortable and short trips are quick | I enjoy the tight and quick response handling | As for quick comparison my last car was a Ford SHO and I would have to say that the 4-cylinder in the Mazda really moves when you go from point A to point B safely | 
 "words": I've had my '07 Mazda6 since Sept '07 and it now has about 13000 miles | I still love it | I find excuses to go places just so I can drive it | Some owners and car authors comment about the lack of power from the 4 cyl engine but I think it has plenty of power | I get over 30 mpg on highway 31 | 5 usually and I've never been in a situation where I wished it had more power even when climbing mountain passes in western NC | I am leasing the car | when lease is up I'm considering buying it | I recently test drove the new '09 Mazda6 and I don't like it as much as my '07 | it's too big and lacks the fun-to-drive factor that the old model has | I think Mazda has screwed up with the remake of the 6 | 
 "words": Great ride awesome acceleration average gas mileage | 
 "words": I love my 6 | This is the first time I've purchased a Mazda and it's been great | I get about 24 MPG | in the city and about 30 MPG | on the highway so it's pretty decent and it's got a really big tank |

 "words": I had owned 3 previous Mazda cars | Thought with this new car I was going to get same quality | Boy was I wrong | I have had to take this car back to dealership for 3 different repairs | Oil pan leaked air conditioning motor went now battery is leaking acid and has corroded the wires | Now I found out there is a Ford motor in the car | Can't wait to see what is next | All this and it hasn't been a year | Thank goodness for a warranty | Lot of time wasted though | I do however like the drive and the interior is very spacious | Plenty of room for the kid and all his toys | There are lots of cubbies to hold things | Regardless of the interior space Mazda has lost me as a life long customer | 
 "words": This is a wonderful car | Mazda's done a great job combining sportiness design value in this car | Exterior really draws the eye it just looks quick | Inside everything about where you expect it to be and falls to the hand easily | Ride is what sells the car to me it's fantastic | I took the 4 cyl for gas mileage getting 28 from a midsize is fine by me | A little raspy when you put your foot down but it moves | Goes exactly where you point it handling is a good as previous BMWs and Audis I have owned | This car wants you to push it | Brakes are 1st class |

 "words": I bought the Mazda6 as a replacement for a Mazda3 | The mazda6 was my first brand new car | I love how it drives and handles | Zoom Zoom | but at 11500 miles I had the transmission replaced | At 13000 I am having the transmission fixed and the front suspension fixed | Sound strange to you | I live in a big city no backwoods dirt roads just city pavement | I am so upside down in this car that I could never get out of it at this rate | I am about to bite the bullet and trade it in anyway for a Honda | I hope no one else is having these problems |

 "words": Smooth engine good handling and nice auto box ruined by worst ride of any car I have owned in 23 years of driving avoid the 18 inch alloys and Pirelli P Zero tyres | Looks great outside cheap materials inside | Loads of space and easy loading on the hatch | Lousy economy | Overall disappointing as on the surface much more interesting than competition | 
 "words": Just bought a used S Grand touring Wagon and love it so far | Got almost 28 mpg on a short 400 mile road trip | Tons of cargo space and configurations | The cargo cover doubles as a doggie cage and can also be moved just behind the front seat when the rear seats are folded down | The bottom portion of the drivers seat seem a little short on leg support could be longer but otherwise it is a comfortable ride for a big guy | 
 "words": Wife was happy with her 2007 silver glacier M6 i 5 Dr Touring HB so shortly after got a 2007 redfire metallic M6 s SVE sedan for myself | The sedan's V6 is very smooth drives and handles great | The M6 hugs the road very well and is fun to drive and quiet overall it's a poor man's sports sedan | Best car owned with regards to driving experience | To improve my M6 sedan's looks found on the internet and added a factory like pre-painted rear wing spoiler for 1 3 the cost of what Mazda charges | Looking to add fog lights |

 "words": I was driving a 2002 Mazda Tribute and when gas prices shot up to 3 per gallon I decided to trade it in for something with better gas mileage | The Mazda 6 i Sport Value Edition is the perfect car for buyers who want 4-cylinder gas mileage but don't want to sacrifice good looks performance and comfortability | I am averaging 25MPG on the highway after 4k miles I usually speed in the left lane | This car is very comfortable to drive | 
 "words": This is a FANTASTIC car | I like the more muscular look of the car when compared with the Camrys Altimas and Accords | This car says Look out | I'm Comin' | I'm exceptionally pleased with the car and highly recommend it |

 "words": I just love this car | I have had it for 2 weeks now and the interior layout is well done as is the exterior | It looks like a peppy midsize car and the performance backs it up | There is a larger turning radius but that was expected with the 17 wheels vs | the 14 on my last car | The traction control and ABS perform wonderfully and those commenting about the wonderful visability through the windshield hit the nail on the head | The red dash lighting is friendly on the eyes when driving at night | Rear passenger map lights CD changer numerous storage spaces and comfy seats are also appreciated bonuses in this car | I suggest a test drive | It doesn't take long to get comfy in one |

 "words": I bought the 4-cyl 5-speed Value Edition after driving a 4-cyl Altima for 7 years | The value is unbeatable it looks great excellent handling good gas mileage | The interior is good with a number of features I did not expect at this price | Front seats are very supportive | The ride is stiff but not harsh | The engine is not as responsive as Altima's and does not feel as strong | Another complaint is somewhat short gearing the engine is close to 3k revs at 60 mph | it gets buzzy at higher speeds and MPG suffers | The stereo sounds great but there is occasional static on FM stations | this did not happen in any other car | 
 "words": I traded my Mazda6 i Sport for this new GT V6 model thinking it would be much better | I was thrilled with my 4 cylinder car and I really cannot notice much more zoom-zoom in this new one unless I'm going up a hill | Nice new features that can be found in luxury cars | Gas mileage is horrible even reving the car low with a stick shift but it was to be expected coming from Mazda | Everyone admires my car | Although I would recommend getting a GT I with 4 cylinder instead of an S with a V6 |

 "words": The 6 is a sharp looking little car | Get behind the wheel and the V6 gets you up and moving promptly | Throttle response is quick though if pressed too hard the engine is prone to rev hard in search of power | The 6 speed auto is especially fun in manual mode but the close ratios make shifting a busy job | Fuel economy does not appear to reap the benefits of 6 gears no matter who is shifting | Heading down the road highway however subtle hints creep in that this is not the touring car its package advertises | Road noise is fairly high and presents a stiff challenge to the meager standard stereo | The ride while absolutely stable is not necessarily smooth and is tiresome on extended trips | 
 "words": Ok | This is coming from a German car snob all my life | I've owned Mercedes BMW and Audi and finally got smart | I had a great deal lined up for a Mercedes ML430 used then did some reading on the horror stories and breakdowns | So decided to test drive the Mazda6 before I went for a 3 series BMW | Guess what | Save the 10k | The Mazda6 is outstanding sexy and prances down the highway at 80 mph with a solid quiet feel | Yeah the beemer is a little quieter better turning radius and tighter on hard turns but get over it for thousands in savings with the Mazda6 | This company knows where the market is | 
 "words": I drove a V6 Mazda 626 for 11 years until it was totaled in an accident | I reluctantly decided to go with a 4 cylinder this time to save gas | New car does not pick up as fast but the shifting is very smooth and the power is quite sufficient | Interior is all black which turns out to look rather sporty from the outside | Seats are very comfortable microfiber with good side bolster support | Driver visibility is terrific especially out of the front window better than in my old 626 | Engine noise is very low and the ride is smooth | IMHO the 6i is the best new car value for the money |

 "words": At 49 years old I have bought many cars in my life and have never felt compelled to write using descriptive words such as fantastic fun to drive love it etc | Mazda definitely got it right with the Mazda 6i in addition to giving the consumer a great value in comparing the 6i to a Camry or even a BMW 3 series they have built what I would consider to be the perfect car for middle America | Having a family car that doesn't resemble a box is refreshing the 6i is not only sporty in looks as it drives more like a sports car than family sedan |

 "words": I've owned may cars over the years ranging from a Porsche to a Focus and also spent 25 years in the car business mostly hi-line European | We just picked up a 5 speed Sport Value edition | The 4 cylinder performance with the manual transmission is surprising | Build quality seems very good | The thing that impresses me the most is what you get for the dollar | We had 03 Focus ZX5 with a sticker of 18k and the Mazda is 20380 four years later | For 2300 more the difference is unbelievable | I think the car is on a par with an A4 Saab 9-3and maybe even BMW 325 | If you're in the market for a fun-to-drive affordable sedan check this car out | IMHO it's probably the most underrated car out there |

 "words": This is a car built for teenagers not for a big not fat man over 50 | Real world driving does not require seats that pinch your legs and shoulder blades to the point of pain | Red lights on the dash at night may be cool in a fighter jet but if you've become far sighted you will not be able to focus on them | Don't expect to carry any hanging clothes because the hook is too close to the drivers seat and the air bag won't work if you hang things on the grab handle | Does anybody really have room for this totally insane key on a keyring | Besides 250 to get another can you say ripoff | And the mileage isn't as good as they say either | I'll unload this turkey even if it costs me thousands |
