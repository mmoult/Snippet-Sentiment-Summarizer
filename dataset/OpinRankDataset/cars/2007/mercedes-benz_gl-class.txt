REVIEWS
 "words": I bought one of the first off the assembly line and have been very happy overall | Only problems I had were at 40000 miles with the cowling around the steering column coming loose and at 48000 the front wheel bearings going bad | Of course all of these problems were fixed by the dealer | The interior of the vehicle is outstanding but the view out the rear window is somewhat restricted | And getting into the third row seat takes a little effort | The third row seat has to be one of the most comfortable available | Adults can actually sit there comfortably without their knees in their chest | I'm not crazy about the exterior design | No complaint with the power it's great | 
 "words": My GL has been into the dealer's not less that four times in under 30000km mainly for suspension problems | In this distance I already have had both front and rear shocks changed and whatever else could be changed down there to reduce vibrations road noise wheel-bouncing | Rear windscreen wiper blade fell off just a few weeks into car's first rainy season I ended up with a scratched rear screen | Vibrations have not stopped make the car unpleasant to drive | Windows shake ever so slightly but you hear the click-click all the time you go over a bump | I have since learned that MB has used the same suspension components which are fitted on the ML | GL is wider though | Anyone out there | 
 "words": Recently purchased this CPO vehicle and I love it | I haven't had the car long enough to have anything break but the design comfort power and features are fantastic | 
 "words": Well I wrote a review and was very pleased after 3 weeks | After a year I had to get rid of because I could not stand the tire suspension problems | Car pulls badly to the right | Dealer says Oh that's just the crown in the road causing that | No way | Wore out tires at 16000 miles and needs an alignment every 3 months | Car gets aligned and runs true for a few months before starting to pull again | Sorry I ever doubted BMW | Do yourself a favor | Check out the driving characteristics first | If you go on the Mecedes forums you will see many have the same disappointment | 
 "words": Great driver fun with plenty of power and comfortable | Good styling controls are easy to use | It's really a joy to drive | Really disappointed in the quality of the tires-25K and they needed replacing | But the real disappointment is the quality and longevity of the brake pads and rotors | Had to replace both rotors and pads at 27K unbelievable | You expect much more better quality from a Mercedes Benz especially under the mild driving conditions Speed in the USA vs the German autobahn | The dealer indicated they have changed material to a softer variation ostensibly to resolve the squeaking issues that I have read about but they have done this at significant reliabilty and customer cost
 "words": Own this 13 months bought brand new | Just completed 50k miles had no problems | Excellent drive | With this size of SUV mileage is very good 24- 25MPG perfect for the highway | Owned several SUVs but I think this is the best and think it will last forever | MB has really improved there product | We are very happy | 
 "words": I loved this car from the minute we saw it | We were planning to buy Ford or Chevy but once we stopped at the Mercedes dealer we couldn't leave without this car | It is an absolute pleasure to drive | We had to have a rear shock replaced but no other problems after 20 months | Brake pads were worn out after only 15000 miles which was a shock and disappointment especially when we found out the cost to replace them | Apparently this is normal for Mercedes brakes | It's a great car but expensive maintenance | 
 "words": Owned this 07 GL320 CDI for 15 months | Overall fuel efficiency has been 22 | 7 mpg through 20500 miles | On the highway we've gotten up to 28 mpg and always 20 around town | Very comfortable on long trips or short commutes | Handled heavy winter snowfall in Spokane and North Idaho with ease | Couple of items to be aware of when purchasing | Uses synthetic Mobil 1 so oil changes are every 10- 12k | Oil light comes on occassionally | Dealer states it's a computer glitch that hasn't yet been corrected | OE tires we have Continental 4x4 Contact 18 are worn out and need to be replaced | 
 "words": I have to admit that I never knew this model existed | The room in this Mercedes GL has it all over the ML | The quality is light-years ahead of the Escalade | The ride is better than a luxury sedan | Came with an off-road package which I don't expect to need but nice to know it's there | Rear entertainment leather nav sunroof and satellite radio are all top notch | 
 "words": I drove an Acura prior to the GL | I looked at the Navigator and Cadillac SUV but settled on the GL | It handle well under all types of road conditions | The ride is excellent and comfortable in locally or on long distance travel | My kids love the third row and the room is great | It has been an excellent investment |

 "words": Traded an ML320CDI diesel for a GL450 gas V-8 | The diesel has a narrower power band more gear shifting with 3-4 second bursts of huge power on demand in the upper gears | The gas V-8 has a wide slightly weaker power band less gear shifting extended acceleration leaves the diesel for dead | Pick your poison | V-8 averaging 18mpg overall on regular gas canceling some of the diesel's excellent 25mpg on pricey diesel fuel | The GL air suspension gives a smooth level ride | Think S-Class | Car-like steering and brakes much better than the vague jerky brakes on the diesel | Standard manual rear hatch is light easy to use | Nav system data entry is tedious results are confusing | 
 "words": This was my pick by far based on looks but I gave my wife the 'command' decision | We drove everything out there from Lexus to Infinity and this one drove most like a car | She picked this one hands down | We have had to have the one of the air shocks replaced but that was no issue | The fit and finish are superb and everything inside is solid and well constructed | We have taken it on 3 long road trips with 3 kids and the quiet ride for the baby the comfort my wife and the joy of driving it me have further impressed us to the point that we will probably buy another in a couple years | The older kids love the back seat entertainment package | 
 "words": This is my 1st MB got a good deal and jumped at the chance to own it | I love the way it handles compared to my old standard SUV's | I wanted something smaller with room for the kid's sports stuff | The GL450 does not have an armrest so on long trips anything over 30 min | my right arm goes numb then I move it down to the bottom of the wheel feeling less in control and still not comfortable | The navigation is very inadequate | Hard to operate compared to most on the market now | Should have compared more vehicles and not just gone for looks | 
 "words": Excellent vehicle needs air pressure to read actual pressure in all tires | Very expensive to maintain | Mercedes does unneccessary things on scheduled manintaince such as check caliper thickness at 10000 miles | Navigation system is one of the worst in the business but not the cheapest | 19 inch tires and wheels are a joke because the tires cost 3 times as much as 18 or 20 inch | MB tech fake leather is very bad stuff | Blue jeans stain it and it does not breath like leather | Pulls very nice and the brake intregation system is superb but far to pricey | Garage door opener works only on occasion | Very weak signal | All in all it is a very nice vehicle but MB has made it far to expensive to maintain
 "words": It's wonderful that Mercedes-Benz made a large SUV shortly after our last one gave up | A fantastic alternative to Cadillac Chevy and other brands with large SUV's | It work's great in snow and rain | And overall very easy to drive | 
 "words": I just bought this used with 10K | It got 23 miles per gallon on average and I drive crazily | Get the diesel it's quiet quick enough and should last forever
 "words": I had an '02 ML500 and currently have an '06 Range Rover | This GL450 is as comfortable as the Range Rover roomier than both and the best ergonomics | The transmission is excellent and I like the upshift downshift buttons on the backside of the steering wheel | Easy to use Navigation and excellent placement of the CD changer in the glove compartment | Rear view camera is clearer than the Rover also | The Rover wins off road but the Benz wins on the highway | 
 "words": My wife and I test drove 5 other luxury SUV's and this outperformed the competition by a wide margin | The quality of this MB SUV is outstanding and you get what you pay for | The acceleration beats the competition and the ride is similar to the S-class sedan | Overall it seems like something out of their AMG class | The GL takes the corners well and the interior is very quiet even on dirt roads | The upgraded sound system plus navigation is a must have | Plenty of room for the two kids and lots of storage room | With the third row seat up there is limited room but the competition had even less | We look forward to numerous road trips in the future | 
 "words": Surprised at the fit and finish of an American assembled MB | Quite a departure from my '98 ML320 that my mechanic often cursed 'this is not a Mercedes | ' Why choose the GL450 550 when 1 gas version comes at a 2500 premium over the diesel not the case usually with diesel vehicles 2 gas version requires premium unleaded fuel premium still costs more than diesel 3 the diesel gets 18 24 gas gets 13 18 GL550 will fare worse | average economy for both cars at 12k miles year and factoring price differences for premium vs | diesel you'd save 600 yr in fuel savings on top of the 2500 | Not noisy not slow no smoke or smell | 0-60 who cares | it's an SUV

 "words": Quality size fast and fun the list could go on | I wanted a large SUV and ended up comparing Navigator Escalade and the GL | In my opinion there is no contest | 
 "words": I've only had my vehicle for about a week and I can say with confidence that this is the best luxury full size SUV on the market | I've driven and researched all other full size SUV's and they don't even compare | This vehicle is quiet comfortable smooth as silk | Quiet as a mouse diesel engine and transmission and drop dead good looks | I keep driving around and never see the fuel gauge move as this vehicle with the diesel gets incredible mileage | Don't walk run to your nearest dealer and order one as they are getting tougher to find due to the great demand | 
 "words": I gave my Acura MDX to my daughter and was looking for another solid SUV | Fell in love with the MB GL450 at first sight | Beautiful inside and out | Then saw the 320CDI version and drove it | Couldn't believe it was a diesel | Who would believe that you could have large comfortably luxury in an SUV and get 27 mpg on the highway | I was only worried about recent MB quality surveys on Consumer Reports but felt a little better given that the GL was totally redesigned | 
 "words": Just returned back from vacation and driven a total of 4000 miles | Got about 20 miles gal | Excellent drive and ride comfort | Love the Off-Road package and P1 and lighting package | All my cars are Benz but thought about buying Lexus LX470 but ended up buying the lovely GL450 |

 "words": This is our second MB | We also own an '05 ML350 and have been very happy with it | My wife traded her 04 Acura MDX for the new GL | We looked at the new 07 Acura MDX and although the Acura appears to be a good value we were not impressed by the overall build quality of our 04 MDX vs 05 ML350 | We also looked hard at the new BMW X5 V8 but determined it was no larger than the Acura MDX and takes you into the price range of the much larger faster smoother and more practical GL | We just hit 3000 miles and we are still fighting over who gets to drive | 
 "words": Looked at MDX too small too ugly exterior | Suburban Z71 looked good with too cheap materials interior for a 50K car | Then we decided to buy the '07 SUV of the year The Mercedes GL450 | The body doesn't look as sexy as the X5 we have but for the big 3rd row seat the cargo space it can't get any better than this | Fit and finish of the exterior and interior is excellent beautiful | That's all I can say | I also test drove the Audi Q7 | I like the look and the exclusive status of Audis but the materials they used is nothing close to Mercedes or BMWs | With a comparable V8 engine Audi wants 60k plus | That's why you don't see many people driving Audis | 
 "words": This is my first Mercedes and my 2nd SUV | I love it | We have 3 small children all in car seats and we all fit very comfortably and easily with room for friends | We live in central New York and have had about 5-6ft of snow since we picked up the GL it handles it like a dream | We will be adding running boards as it's a bit high for small kids and grandparents | 
 "words": This SUV has everything you dream of having in a vehicle | Quiet and smooth ride true luxury powerful brakes top of the line technology nice looking and best of all it's a Mercedes | 
 "words": I have had other SUV's Mercedes Benz BMW Cadillac lexus and I love my new GL the Best | I t can tow my boat with no problem and I can go on vations with my family | I love the handling and the drive | 
 "words": I have to say Mercedes Benz has done a great job with this vehicle | I had my doubts at first but after driving it for a week now I've really gotten into this thing | Its comfortable smooth and can handle alot of cargo if the time comes | 7-speed auto gives the engine maximum flexibility but it still drinks gas like any full size | 
 "words": We've owned the GL for three months now and it has been flawless | I've put 4000 miles on it with regular trips from the SF Bay Area to the sierras | It's incredibly solid and comfortable on the highway completely stable on ice and snow and easy to drive around town | The car is deceptive there is a lot of room for both people and cargo hauling | We own this and an E-Class and the GL feels even smoother to drive than the E | We tried all the 3-row SUVs and nothing on the market comes close to the GL | 
 "words": The GL class is by far the most enjoyable and lovable vehicle that anyone requiring cargo space passenger space and snowy driving conditions could dream for | It handles beautifully | It abounds in standard luxury although do add the well- designed P1 package and sunroof package | P1 is equipped with everything you'd want and nothing you wouldn't want and the exterior lines are gorgeous | I have sampled the new Acura MDX the Escalade and the larger Lexus SUV's | There is simply no comparison | The BMW X5 is still too small too slow without the V8 and the options are overpriced | If you drive the GL450 you will buy it | It's as simple as that | 
 "words": This is the third SUV I have owned and by far the best that I have test driven or owned | The options do run up the price but all of the large luxury SUVs cost big bucks | The GL drives and feels like a MB is fast quiet and roomy | Backup camera is a must | Great sound system | Nav system is easy once you learn it | 
 "words": The car has a smooth and quiet ride | It has a solid feel to it | My family loves it | I haven't had any problems with it so far | Love this car |

 "words": We order a new '07 X5 but after having borrowed the demo from the dealer we found the X5 still to small for a family | Still has the BMW performance though | So we purchased the GL450 and found that it has the size for the family and pretty decent performance | The interior features are great and the safety features are even better | Mercedes did a nice job with this vehicle and I think they hit a high luxury SUV market that BMW has yet to hit | If you need room for kids and cargo look no further | I just hope the build quality coming out of Alabama is better than I've read in the past |

 "words": I have only owned it a week and love it | It has more room than my previously owned 2006 VW Touareg which was a good crossover SUV which did not enough room for my three sons even after one just departed for college | Also the M-B GL450 is so much nicer then my previous 2000 Lincoln Navigator relative to ride gas mileage and just plain sophistication | The M-B Tex interior is well worth forgoing the extra 1650 for leather too | The only feature that could be improved is the back-up camera showing the actual orientation of the vehicle for parking etc | My VW Touareg had this at 20K less | All in all this is not a lot different in features then my wife's 2005 M-B S500 | Just Great |

 "words": Driving the GL is a great experience I am very happy with it | After having an Acura and a Lexus I was happy to be back with MB | I was surprised to see a serious lack of technology | especially with the outdated navigation system a portable one with a fraction of the price has more features and less complicated and you should be able to change the radio station or CD without loosing the view of the map | Touch screen is standard in other cars | DVD in the back under the back seat make it imposible to change DVD or start it for the kids without stopping and diving under the seat mainly it is for kids restrained in the back seat | Need child safety locks for the back doors |

 "words": Drives like a big M-B sedan which is not perfect like our BMW M5 but nonetheless very competent and solidly comforting | Unlike most other SUVs that we've driven the steering feels well connected to the road and very safe at high speeds on the highway | And it looks right at home in the country club parking lot | The exterior design combines elegance and muscularity in a way that should become the new standard for luxury SUVs | The same can be said for its ergonomics which are simply outstanding | The controls for its many gizmos and gadgets are readily accessible and fairly intuitive allowing us to avoid spending our nights reading the owner's manual | 
 "words": I wasn't 100 sure this vehicle was worth the price when I signed the paperwork | But after a 750 mile trip home the day we purchased it I was completely convinced | The ride is smooth and silent | The interior is well designed and comfortable | And the vehicle has all of the features a family needs | Our model is loaded with all of the options less the distronic cruise control amd the vented leather fronts seats | I averaged 18 | 8 MPG on our return trip | Not bad given the vehicle was loaded to capacity | Definitely investigate the keyless go | Walking up to the car with bags in one had and your kid in another and never having to unluck the doors or insert a key to start the gine is nice | 
 "words": What a great vehicle | Moved from an '01 Landcruiser I loved to this vehicle | Would have bought another cruiser but the style and options are a little dated | So far this vehicle is far superior to the cruiser | The transmission and ride is unbelievably smooth and comfortable | The acceleration is great for such a large truck | It has almost every option you would want in a vehicle of this type and so far they all work wonderfully well | The interior is absolutely beautiful and all of the controls are efficiently located and I understand that most are copied from other Mercedes vehicles which is good because they have been time tested | 
 "words": This truck is awesome | I drove every SUV under the sun and this one blows them all away | Not too big not too small | Just right | Love the pick up | Pure luxury | Hope there won't be any problems to work out being it's a new model and all |
