REVIEWS
 "words": I love this car | It has a sleek look to itSporty yet elegant | Great sound system | Havn't had any maintenance issues after 50000 miles | Really good handlingI had to swerve sharply on the highway once and the car was very responsive and easy to control | Very comfortable and plenty of spaceeven in the back seats | Great car for long comutes | 
 "words": Is fact now that a control arm defect is confirm but at 25000 mile is maintenace service were from dealer | So do you want to replace the problem for 419 with the same defect product | Also if tried align with defect product will cause gas will burn faster and wear you tire faster | Also engine correction on V belt replace | To must problem | Plus a copy of MADZA 6 suspension i should have just but Madza | Rate now of 10000 and less and year and model if paid more you got robbery | 
 "words": Overall I am very pleased with the purchase nearly 3 years later | I still get compliments on the cars styling | For a purchase price less than 25000 the car was a solid value | 
 "words": I purchased my 2007 Ford Fusion SEL used in October of 08' with around 24k on her | I had read many reviews on the car before my initial purchase and was willing to take the leap | I also hated my 2003 Liberty and refused to purchase a GM or Chrysler product again | I had never owned a Ford product before and was a bit nervous | However I have been greatly impressed with the vehicle thus far | I love the leather seating although it does not seem to have the quality of other vehicles | A little premature cracking etc | I have experienced some odd cabin noises various creaking and such mainly from the passenger seat and console | Get up and go is fair gas mileage could be better | 
 "words": I owned my Fusion for two years | Purchased new in 2007 | The car has had its issues most of the headaches were caused by the dealership but overall I am happy with it | The handling the leg room quiet interior are a few highlights | The one feature that stands out is the AWD | It works and it works well | A few bad winters with the standard package of snow ice freezing rain slush and the occasional ham-head soccer mom with her 23 passenger SUV sliding backwards in my lane did not hinder the car's ability to make it to point B and back to point A | The location of the auxiliary input is also a plus | Located in the center console with an extra 12 volt DC outlet was an excellent idea | 
 "words": I bought my Fusion used and immediately loved it | I hadn't planned on buying a Ford and was really looking at the Camry and Accord but I fell it love with the Fusion after the first test drive | It looks great | It rides and handles great | Its not a sports car but I have no problem passing on the freeway | I have been getting 27 MPG with mixed driving | The few small complaints I have about it have all been fixed in the newer models | My car was totaled by a drunk driver while it was parked in front of my house and the only car Im considering to replace it is another Fusion | Just a great car that is well made and thousands less than any of its competitors | 
 "words": Fusion a merging of diverse elements into a unified whole | Fits the description of the Ford Fusion I bought 2007 one owner w 18200 miles | I studied and researched several cars before deciding on the V6 SEL Fusion and I have not been disappointed in the least | Class and style a head turner | Very comfortable and responsive | Hope the long term reliability holds true | 
 "words": I bought this car in Nov 08 with 7800 miles | Living in Western Pa | and traveling 100 miles a day to work and back | I was looking for something that had great handling in the snow | The AWD V6 is very responsive and great traction on snow and wet roads | The Fusion's has allot of room and a comfortable ride | No problems | I put 20000 miles on so far have been averaging 22 combined and 26 HWY | The design is awesome Ford has a real winner in the Fusion | I would recommend this car to anyone | 
 "words": Just purchased a used v6 07 fusion with 48000 k's very pleased with the value this car has | Mazda 6 based platform is great and the build quality is rock solid | Comfy seats and nice styling compliment a very complete design | This car will put ford back on the radar screen for sure | 
 "words": The way it is build feel like a Toyota Corolla handle | Problem with value stem in the first years | Fuel burns like a toyota corolla one tank get you to dallas as for the fusion half tank | Steering is bad sway can lose control if high winds of texas | I believe that the computer is outside the firewall and in texas were is flood i would not buy this car if i know | Plus I would not buy this car for 16000 nor 13000 for a value of the depression is quick | The only way to keep track is if is sold at 11000 to 120000 and that is the max price | At 24k plus miles i am think of trading it off already | 
 "words": I bought my Fusion after test driving the 4 and 6 and the awd | I settled on the awd v6 | It felt that it drove through bumps and didn't hop like I felt the fwd does | The v6 is almost too much for stop and go and the brakes are super sticky | I'm not too fond of the tall back end | I'm 6'2 and have a hard time backing up | Also the drinks are right under your shifter or your arm | And the window is so tall I can't put my arm on it | 
 "words": Get the appearance package | The faux leather seats fool everyone and are quite comfortable | 17rimslower profile tires are well worth the extra price | Rear spoiler is subtle not a big wing | Spoiler has led lites | 6cd mp3 radio is very good | No need to upgrade unless you're an audiophile nut | Handling | This is where the suprise is | It is by far the best riding and handling 20K car out there period | Even more expensive cars can't compare to the ride | My wife says it's just as comfortable as any BMW | Getting 29 mpg mixed driving when driving like grandma | 35mpg all highway with cruise set at 65 | 25mpg when driving like a typical NJ NYC person | 
 "words": I have owned my Fusion for two months | Overall an excellent car | My driving is 100 city and I am averaging 20 MPG | There really isn't anything on the car I don't like other than I haven't found a good dealer to get my car serviced at | Have had a quirky thing happen the information center says the driver's side door is open when it really is not | Will have it looked at when I go in for my first oil change | 
 "words": I love my new Ford Fusion | I get compliments on it all the time | It rides way smoother than my Mother's Chevy Impala and it is quieter too | I love the 6 disk in-dash CD player | The gas mileage could be improved a lot | I am only getting 25mpg on the highway right now | The biggest problem I have with it is my windshield | I have had my car a month and a half and I am going on my 3rd windshield | The first one splintered the 2nd week I had my car | The second one within two days of getting it fixed it had splinters twice from small rocks hitting it | I am a highway driver so I expect rocks to do damage | But I have never had a windshield break this easily this often | It's expensive and ridiculous | 
 "words": I always liked the looks but after a test drive I was sold on this Fusion | I swore away from buying Fords or any other North American cars for the last 20 years because of reliability problems compared to Japanese makes | But the Fusion is really reliable according to Consumer Report surveys | So you get a really good car with a V6 and 6 speed transmission for the price of a Japanese 4 | It's a great car to drive and I love the way that 6 speed transmission responds and keeps the revs down even when you're blasting down the highway | Sure mileage could be better but that was my choice over a 4 | My only disappointment was finding out until it was too late that I couldn't tow a trailer | 
 "words": The Ford Fusion has it all well almost | The car has sleek lines and handles like it | The 6 speed automatic is flawless and never searches for gears | The car is very quiet on the open road very little wind noise at all | Compare this car to the others in the mid-size segment and it is a winner | You cannot go wrong with this car | I love it as much now as the day I bought it | I chose options such as ABS heated seats traction assist and leather interior | With X-plan pricing and a rebate to boot I couldn't go wrong | Neither can you | 
 "words": I have been unfortunate to have my 2006 Ford Fusion hit at 40 miles per hour while the car was stopped | The car that hit the Fusion was totaled but my car drove off with minimal damage | It took the hit well as much as the car is a joy to own it is safe as well | 
 "words": While I only have 2000 miles the build quality is excellent design and styling exception for US designed car and general thought behind car is above the rest including Toyota and Honda | Have every option but navigation however there are a couple of design changes needed | The area visible once trunk is opened becomes a catch all for dust dirt etc | here in the desert | A better redesigned seal on trunk is warranted | Plastic louvers are below windshield wipers needs to be improved as it is a catch all as well | Headlight illumination could be improved and gas mileage is very poor in city stop and go driving less than 20mpg | however highway is approaching 30mpg | 
 "words": I did not realize how well these cars handled until I drove one | There is a ton of power when you hit the gas it goes fast | And it still gets about 28 MPG on the freeway | Also I'm a big guy | So I needed a car that I could fit into easily | The interior of this car is huge and it also has a massive trunk | Great for sports equipment or large subwoofers like I put in mine | I would say this car is a fantastic balance between luxury and price | 
 "words": Fun to drive solid performance | Great looking inside and out | Ride is quiet and nimble on the freeway | Quick enough to get around the city great for long drives | Interior is very comfortable and plenty of room for 5 | 
 "words": I've owned 10 new Pontiacs 2 new Toyota's and this is my sixth new Ford and this one is the best of all | It does everything well good performance reasonable gas mileage for its size and its comfortable | I like the style and enjoy driving it | The extra powerpoint needs to be outside the center console it's hard to reach even if the console were empty which is never the case | I would like to see a super sport edition with a V-8 some gas shocks and a supercharger | This would rival the Impala SS and still be sensible enough for adults | Fusion is fun with lots of potential | If it proves to be reliable over the long term Ford has a winner | 
 "words": Our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion is an exceptional automobile with many features you might expect in a car costing thousands of dollars more | Its distinctive bold styling was one of the deciding factors as were the reliability statistics | This car's superb handling attributes are one of its significant pluses | My wife and I highly recommend this car to anyone who is in the market for a quality mid-size family sedan that is fun to drive | 
 "words": Just got my '07 SEL V6 leather Fusion and like it a lot | Sharpest car on the road and the Redfire paint and spoiler are awesome | Extremely smooth transmission and the V6 is as powerful as I'd ever want need | Love the lines on this car but not quite sure about the rear tail lights yet but they're growing on me | No interior rattles and am amazed at how well this car corners with no roll | Only issues I have so far are with the fit and finish in some areas | You get a lot of car for the money so maybe I shouldn't be complaining about the fit and finish | 
 "words": I'm a young working professional and after the first 1K miles I'm very pleased with the Fusion | I've been a Jetta driver the last 6 years and this car has been a nice transition from import to domestic | I put a lot of miles on my cars and make frequent roadtrips so I wanted a reliable sports sedan that wasn't a beast on gas | I opted for the SE model with the appearence package including leather-trimmed seats with red stitching sunroof fog lights spoiler and upgraded tires and wheels | The ride is smooth the styling is sleek and the overall quality has been quite impressive | The seats are extremely comfortable and make driving very enjoyable | Can't wait to hit the highway again | 
 "words": The design of this car is amazing | Reminds me of an Audi A6 | I love the black leather with white stitching | Many standard features and great sight lines | I have had my car now for 6 months and it is the best car I have owned yet | Powerful stylish comfortable and safe with all the air bags surrounding you | Large trunk spacious back seat | Controls are easy to use and handles great | 
 "words": My Fusion has 3000 miles on it | Fit and finish are excellent | The heater fan in defrost mode makes more noise than I expected | Otherwise interior is excellent and quiet | Automatic transmission shifts nicely | 4cyl engine accelerates noticeably faster than my 6cyl Ranger at low and high speeds | Fuel economy averages 29mpg with 35 stop-and-go city and 65 unimpeded highway 63-67mphon cruise control | At each fill-up I have figured the mileage manually to check the computer | The computer is accurate | On the highway I have seen 33 | 6mpg on the computer at 63mph | Excellent value at an affordable price | 
 "words": I absolutely love my Ford Fusion | It is the best car I have ever owned | I went from a convertible which was very noisy to the quietest car I have ever had | The thing that attracted me first was its exterior looks | I test drove several other models including Saturn Dodge and Toyota but the Ford Fusion was the best | I bought the dark blue pearl and it looks great with the chrome grill | It accelerates well too | I have to drive up a lot of hills where I live | It also has a great sound system | I also bought it for the traction control and AWD because of bad winters | I plan on owning this car for many years to come | 
 "words": I have been Fusionated to the future | Exterior quad-head lights and chrome grill is classy | Interior dash is smooth and space age | It makes other cars look old and outdated as you drive by | Great stereo | What a great feeling to drive a futuristic car | 
 "words": Just bought my Fusion SEI45M picked this over a Focus Mazda3 and Civic DX-G | No comparison | Much more room better ride quieter more comfortable and just as fun or more fun to drive as either | Gas mileage is unbelievable first trip saw 41 mpg imperial gallons | 
 "words": Test drove a SEL Fusion after driving a 2007 Altima | Not only was the Fusion 3000 less but it has all wheel drive | The Fusion has a great ride and handles great probably due in no small part to the premium tires | During a recent snow storm the car performed great on frozen slush and ice | The audiophile Sirius sound system is also terrific much much better than the Bose system in my Murano | The fit and finish of the car are every bit as good as the Altima | The only flaw I've found is a little flashing on the door panel | Controls are logically placed and the ergonomics were well thought out | The heated leather seats are very supportive and comfortable | Another plus is the large trunk | 
 "words": Although I've had this car for only a short time first impressions are very good | Like the zip size 6-speed transmission | Surprised mileage isn't better having a 6-speed transmission | Taking a cross-country trip in May and will be able to assess highway mileage better | Overall a solid peppy good looking 4-door | All the electronic features are hard to figure out | 
 "words": Had the vehicle for almost a year and it is a head turner | Really do not see too many on the road and I am not sure why | I put on 20 inch chrome wheels and tires and they really improved the look and steering | 
 "words": Our 2007 V6 6-speed automatic transmission AWD SEL Fusion is a fantastic car EXCEPT for the horrific in-city gas mileage a pitiful 13 mpg after 1800 miles | Our terrain is flat as a fritter | The climate is mild 56 degrees on Feb | 27 and we are both conservative gentle drivers | The car did however achieve 26 | 5 mpg going and 24 | 2 mpg returning on a recent 360-mile trip | It's the in-city stop-and-go travel 95 percent of our driving that is the killer | I find it incomprehensible that a 3300-pound mid-size car would have such terrible in-city mileage in the year 2007 | We enjoy everything else about the car | Ford has a winner here | But the mileage situation needs to be addressed
 "words": After 2200 miles I can say great fun to drive | Excellent on highway with minimal road noise and no cross wind disturbance | Transmission shifts smoothly and silently | Braking is straight and secure | Super climate control system with heated leather seats makes cold weather no problem | Seems very well built with excellent fit and finish | Tall riders love back seat leg room | Large trunk and fold down seats allow surprising storage | Agree with previous comments about less than perfect rear visibility at the corners and turning radius a bit wide with 17inch wheels but still parks easily | 
 "words": This is a great car | The only drawback I can complain about is the gas mileage has been consistently hovering at 21mpg with about 50 50 city highway driving | Other than that you can't buy a better car for anywhere near the price | I have all the luxury options except AWD and have had no problems with anything on the car | It handles well has ample power and rides smooth | The sound quality from the audiophile radio is fantastic | Buy one you'll be happy | 
 "words": This is a fun car | I have read some reviews where people say I wish it had auto on off lights etc | It comes with auto on off lights in this trim | Feels sturdy and secure handles very well in snow and ice | Interior is fine but needs to be adjusted e | g | Nav system should be up higher so driver doesn't have to look down to see it etc | You need rear spoiler or else third brake light blocks your rear view | 
 "words": I recently traded in my Subaru and was intrigued by Ford's new AWD Fusion | It looked like a good package overall so I gave it a chance | I'm impressed | The powertrain is quite refined maybe not on the level of a Camry but very good | I'd love to see Ford's larger 3 | 5 in this car | The transmission has been very responsive and oddly I feel has gotten better over time upshifting knowing my driving style | Fit and finish is better than I've seen in almost any car in its class | I've been averaging about 21-22 in suburbs and some highway but I'm a fairly aggressive driver so I'm pleased | So far I would definitely recommend this car | 
 "words": Looked at the Toyota Honda and Cadillac | Much more Bang for the Buck with this car | Great ride great look great mileage | Only time will tell but so far so good | 
 "words": i will feel guilty if i don't share my great experiences with you | Great price great car and great dealer | Ford should tell the truth instead of 23 31 MPG i get 27 35 MPG for the first month and first 1000 miles | Yes as the reviewers here said I-4 is a little bit noisy when the engine speed is higher than 2000 rpm at local driving | However when you drive it on highway man it is so quiet | I am a Ford lover | Compared to other Ford cars you can see Ford pays a lot of attention on it and try to regain the No | 1 position of family car | Taurus lost its No | 1 in 1996 | Fusion is very competitive from all aspects | compared to my Focus it is worth to pay the extra money | 
 "words": Got a Fusion for the features and found it very comfortable to drive and many cool features keep popping up | Audio input in the middle console front passenger seat lays flat etc | It just looks good sitting still as well | 
 "words": This is the first car I have owned in past 15 years | Always drove a pickup | Wanted something that would do well in the snow and be fun to drive | So far have not been disappointed | This car with AWD does great in the snow and is a blast to drive | Love the size of the trunk | 
 "words": It seems that you are driving an European car made to excel in windy roads | It gives you uncompromised power and still great fuel economy | 
 "words": I was kinda nervous because Ford never had the best reputation however this car is very awesome | I got the I-4 SE with the appearance package which has the best rims you can get aluminum with painted inside pockets and the black vinyl with red stitching and red fabric inlay | The quality seems very good the ride is awesome and smooth virtually no road noise | I am very impressed | There is a lot that is standard with this car which is nice for a change | 
 "words": Loving it | Mine is Silver Birch with a rear spoiler power moonroof and nice tint | I have had mine for a week now | I test drove this 4 times to make sure I was not hallucinating | The power of the dohc v6 is excellent | I would have bought the 4 cylinder if the deal would not have worked out on the v6 | The styling is strong distinguished classy understated smart and masculine with man-grille up front anchoring this good handling ride resting on sweet styled 17 alloys | Handling is great for this segment | Fit and finish makes this easily the best Ford sedan ever | It is the poor mans CTS and does have Caddy drivers looking | 
 "words": This was the first 'New' car I have purchased and I am very happy with my decision | I test drove many different cars Accord Camry Charger Caliber etc | and settled on the Fusion | Put on 2500 miles in less than a month | Very comfortable for long drives and averaged 28 mpg | Comfortably seats 4 took a trip with three friends shortest being 6'1 and everyone had plenty of room | 
 "words": I am getting 27mpg in mixed driving | I love the smooth ride and the way it corners | You really have to look at the appearance package it comes with leather-like seats with black and red cloth inserts 17 wheels smoke chrome grill upgraded radio I love the iPod jack that plays your iPod | The manual transmission has a nice feel | The fog lamps work very well | This package is only about 300 more | I also got the rear spoiler | Not one problem with car | Only thing I would suggest is after about a hundred miles I would open her up a little bit to seat the rings I babied the car and found I was a quart and a half low on oil so I set the rings | After adding oil the more I drive the car the more I like it | 
 "words": This AWD model has the great handling I love in our Subaru | The engine is responsive enough for everyday driving | Some people complain it's underpowered but for the price and package it's a great value | If you want Mustang or Corvette speeds go get one of them | This car handles a turn like a wide receiver sure-footed and quick | Some people complain about road noise but I haven't found it objectionable | My son said the engine when revved hard sounds like Lightning McQueen from the movie Cars | That's fine with me | The other feature I enjoy is spacious front and rear seating | I'm 6'4 and there's still room for a real person to sit behind me with no discomfort | 
 "words": I drove a Taurus many years | This car has great trunk space and is all usable as oppose to having a trunk with a lot of bumps that cause you to not be able to really get suitcases to lay flat | The power of the V6 is amazing | 
 "words": This is a pleasant family sedan | Even with the 4-cylinder it cruises smoothly and quietly at highway speeds | I'm getting over 28 mpg manual trans | Clutch engagement is easy and smooth | After driving more powerful cars the biggest adjustment is I need to downshift to safely pass on two-lane roads | At 80-mph the engine is turning about 3500 RPM and sounds a little busy | 
 "words": Smooth zippy tight quiet with great appeal inside and out | I bought this car for my daughter and she loves it | We looked at test drove Cobalts and Focuses first and then found that the Fusion is way worth the extra 1500 we paid | Only driven it 300 miles so far but it truly is a quality car at a great price | The 5M is gutsy quick and feels like a 6-cylinder not a 4 banger | Visibility is excellent in all directions | Very little road noise | Love the cruise design on the steering wheel | 
 "words": I waited to review this vehicle because I really wanted to try it for a month before giving my final impression | One thing that I've like about what Ford has done with their cars has been the conservative design of the interiors | Nothing flashy everything is in a place that makes sense and the quality feels fine | Some people have complained about engine noise on the 4 cylinder but I don't think it's that obnoxious | It's a fun to drive car for a mid-size | I'm impressed with the fuel economy it gets about as good of mileage as the Focus I used to own | It makes my 30 mile commute to work painless I enjoy driving with this car | 
 "words": I really do like this car but the only problem is that there isn't enough power | I would've gone for the V6 but they didn't have it in a manual | In any case the reliability and build quality of the car is great my family has owned 4 Fords in the past and this is definitely the best | The interior isn't any worse than the Accord or Camry but all three are pretty ugly | The interior design is simple which is a good thing and the leather wrapped stick feels great to drive | 
 "words": I was originally thinking about an Impala or used Camry | I am very glad I chose the Fusion | I have averaged 32- 34 MPG on two lane highway 29-30 MPG on interstate and overall about 27 MPG | We have one young child under a year old and have plenty of room for everything during our long trips home 400 miles | The only drawback is turning radius which I was aware of before buying the car but it does not turn on a dime more like a nickel | I have 13000 miles on it already and have enjoyed them all | I drove several late model Dakota's previously and this car is just as fun and enjoyable to drive | I recommend it fully | 
 "words": This is my first new car purchased for college and expecting 15k a year | So far I'm impressed with the car it's comfy with a nice ride and it's quiet | It's practical with lots of room for people and things but also fun to drive thanks to the great handling | I purchased the awd model due to where I live we get snow | in fact the day I bought it I drove home in snow very confidently car has lots of grip | Only things I can think of needing to be addressed are build quality just a bit fuel economy could be better I think and the engine could be better which I hear is on the way but even that engine now used in the MKZ isn't so great | Mine was loaded except for navigation system | I paid 24000 | 
 "words": Very sensible sedan but feels like a coupe | very good handling and I don't prefer front wheel drives very easy on fuel unless you jump on it but the power is there when you demand it | That's because of a very well tuned six speed transmission | Definitely go for the six cylinder six speed auto transmission | smooth power less hard working engine | 
 "words": Car is well put together | Ddriveline is very smooth and handles great | If you do a lot of interstate driving forget the 4 get the v-6 | Tennessee interstates demand you do 80 M | P | H at the end of the acceleration ramp | I could not find a better made vehicle with a v-6 for the amount of money I paid | 
 "words": I have to say that I am pleased with this purchase | I have checked out the 2007 Toyota Camry and the 2007 Honda Accord too expensive and not impressed | The Ford Fusion saved me over 7k and it was a practical purchase | My vehicle is fully loaded without the Navigation System and the spoiler | This is my fourth brand new vehicle from Ford that I have purchased over the last 15 years and so far I had a very good experience | I had a 1992 Ford Thunderbird with over 180k miles and recently a 2003 Ford Focus ZX3 with over 60k miles | I highly recommend this vehicle | 
 "words": I have always owned Hondas but I decided to trade in my Accord on a brand new Fusion | It was a great idea | Instead of having to put aftermarket parts on my car to make it be appealing the Fusion already comes with chromed-two tone leather-carbon fiber dash-and nice head and tail lights | I have mine in black with black and grey leather | it looks better and is just as reliable as any factory Honda out there | So why would anyone pay more for a Honda my Fusion is one of the best ideas I've had in a long time
 "words": Taut well put together quiet big back seat zoomy 23 mpg combined city highway great sound system smooth-shifting SIX speed automatic transmission six air bags etc | what's not to like | 
 "words": My new Fusion is awesome | Bought it new with 3k miles on it the dealership used it for the commercial accounts salesman | It is the SEL model with auto transmission and 4 cylinder engine | It drives great the suspension and handling make it extremely fun to drive | I have gotten as high as 37 mpg on a trip from Bangor ME to Coventry RI about 338 miles | that was a little bit more than a half of tank | I was skeptical about getting a 4 cylinder but it has some good pep when needed so no complaints | I was told the 4 cylinder was the same engine used in the Ford Probe | I have never been a fan of Ford but this Fusion has changed my mind | 
 "words": I bought the Fusion without ever seeing one in person and I really love this car | Gas mileage has been up to and over 30 MPG from the beginning | I also don't have any problems getting started from a full stop of punching the pedal to get out of a tight situation | The reports of slow response to gas pedal input just aren't as bad as they are made out to be | I am also 6'4 tall and have zero issues with leg and head room | I also have no problems with the turning radius | My previous vehicle was a Ranger which had a larger turning radius so the Fusion's tighter turning is a nice change of pace | 
 "words": Got the car and drove it to PA from Texas and back | Mileage averaged about 26 | 5 | No problems | Torque steer a bit strong | Transmission somewhat hesitant to upshift | Tight steering and no flutter in the rain | Overall seems like a good deal for the money | Was about 3K less than an Altima with comparable fit finish and performance I own two Altimas | Not going to get excitement but a solid competent cost effective performer | I paid about 22 | 3 for it so the deal wasn't super but it wasn't bad either | It deserves a look if you are interested in a midsize | 
 "words": Fast accelerating tight turning capability | Exterior design is beautiful | And fairly inexpensive | 
 "words": Bought this car used but spent a lot of time researching before buying Fusion | Wanted leg room head room gas mileage room for two teenage boys and 6 year old in back | Got it all | with a great price too | I have NEVER regretted getting this car | Would not hesitate to purchase another | 
 "words": I bought my car in the fall of 07 6 months after i bought it it started making a noise when i started it and turned the ac on | well i took it in to the dealer they said it was the belt so they changed it | the noise stopped for a week then came back | i took it in again they told me they couldnt figure out what was wrong | so i took it to another dealer ended up having to leave it for a week to have my tensioner pulley and ac clutch pulley replaced and my motor readjusted | a year later its making the same noise | not please with the vehicle should have keep my 05 altima way nicer car |

 "words": I bought my 07 Fusion w 30k on it last year and it is a great all-around commuting car | It doesn't have the acceleration and power that I prefer but it more than makes up for this as far as ride quality is concerned | It is one of the SMOOTHEST riding cars you'll ever have | I literally keep falling asleep while driving due to the low wide noise and smooth ride | The interior is very nice and neat and of course the exterior meets a tame middleground between sophistication and sportiness | The seats aren't the comfiest but they're good | So if you have kids and a tight budget and you're not a speedster this is a great car | It's reliable and doesn't feel cheap |

 "words": After searching for months I came back to the Fusion | This car is a winner | The styling is unique | The V-6 is worth a little less MPG than the 4 cyl | as it shifts flaulessly is very quiet and has plenty of power when needed | By far the handling is the best | After learning the underpinnings are from Volvo no wonder | I thought as my last 2 cars were Volvo and this car handles like no other import car | The interior is fresh and simple not gaudy like Camrys' fake beach glass glowing controls and old folks boring bisque color scheme | Get all the options even if you think you don't need them I did and I'm glad very good value |
