REVIEWS
 "words": Bought car as B-day present for self | Was great | super fast | The Sync Rev is awesome | You can basically drive it as if it's a manual w o the clutch | Burning out is easy won every race I had with it but 1 | The only problem was axle broke on me after 2 months while swerving to not hit something freak accident Still love this car | The 370 is better in some ways not all | I would most def recommend this car | If you get this car get the NISMO | It looks better | Love this car though | you can get one for a good deal ina lot of places now really cheap because of 370Z | My car was white with limo tint w 18 chrome also with orange interior | 
 "words": I have always been a huge fan of sports cars | but this one takes the cake | I got it w just under 25000 miles on it it still looks immaculate | Everything about the vehicle is outstanding except for the hard plastics which has been vastly improved w soft materials in the 370 | If you can ignore that minor issue you will be very satisfied w the iconic Z | I prefer the 370 but did not get it because this one was a steal | 
 "words": I'm 56 years old and after raising 5 children I decided to get something for me | I looked at several other cars and for one year I did all my homework | I looked at the Miata RX-8 and the BMW Z-4 | The 350m is by far the most exhilarating car I've ever driven | I bought the 6 speed and it will do about 35 mph per gear | You do the math | And the mileage I get around 26 average | And the funnest thing I like to do is turn | Man this car will cut like nothing I've ever driven | So my overall rating is don't test drive one if you aren't going to GET ONE | 
 "words": My son and I drove 260 miles to get this car new | Actually he drove 250 miles | I drove the last 10 miles | It was the exact color combo I was looking for and I managed to drive it off the lot for less than a used one | I had been looking for months at convertibles that I could feel comfortable in and still have disposable monthly income left for savings and eventual retirement | I looked at the 2 pricey Porsche the mild mannered miata the 2 large Corvette and the Honda s2k my son's dream car which he eventually bought | I believe I got the best of all four cars in my z speed luxury great looks reliability and affordability | I will be zgo tripin for years to come | 
 "words": This is a very great car to drive | My car is the base model 350z coupe | Has less features than the other models | Doesn't have the stereo unit controls on the steering wheel | Steering wheel seems a bit less sporty than what you get out of most other sports cars | The power is great and sounds great especially with dual intakes | Definitely a head turner and I'm always getting props | Base Model comes without Traction Control System and the Limited Slip Differential | Meaning you have to be VERY careful when taking turns and gassing it | You can easily lose control | Which is a reason why professional drifters prefer this model because you can slide everywhere | Donuts are easy | Very fun car | 
 "words": I read the professional reviews by Edmunds and was a little concerned where they stated the car was not a daily driver etc | I loved the styling much better in person than pictures | The body and added performance bits were for me though | I have been driving the car for a year now and in the winter with winter tires and different rims all I have to say is that this is definitely a daily driver car and I live in NE Ohio | The Sport suspension and killer looks never fail to impress | Added the NISMO intake kit and wow what a sound | As good a ride as any performance car | Go figure | It all depends what you like | I have driven 14K miles in this car | 
 "words": I got my 2007 Grand Touring Roadster convertible just about 5 months ago and overall I'm really happy with my purchase | I bought this as a second car couldn't part with my BMW 325i and thought I'd primarily drive it on weekends and when the weather is nice | Well I haven't driven the Beemer but maybe 5 times since getting my Z | I'll garage the Z when the winter comes but until then I'm in it with the top down | 
 "words": There are lots of things about this vehicle that make it a great buy | value for the dollar | fuel economy about 20 greater than advertised | excellent road griping ride | quick responsive powerful engine | nice exhaust roar | sharp expensive looks | automatic convertible pull down | quality interior and exterior |

 "words": Just purchased a new 350Z Conv | and it's awesome | The interior design is very simple which I love about Nissan not too little not too much | When I heard this car crank up for the 1st time I thought I was going to start salavating | All in all I love that WOOM sound it makes | The engine just barks at you and I'm a 30 yr old female | The salesman said I could get a turbo put on it | I told him he was insane | That's asking for trouble | Best sports car for the money | 
 "words": I have owned many cars both American made and Japanese but this car is by far the best quality I have seen in some time | Being that it is a convertible it does have some squeaks and rattles sometimes but other than that the car is exceptional | Bose stereo is nice and loud even with top down | Very impressed with the quality of the leather used for the seats | The only gripe I have this far is that this car absolutley needs to lose some weight | weighing in at 3600 lbs it is nearing my old 300c with the hemi | 
 "words": Waited 37 years since I laid eyes on the 1st Z back in 1970 | Owned a 280 and 300 but this is the car of my dreams | Owned almost a year 8K miles | It has exceeded all my expectations | Few cars outrun it no cars outclass it | Best described by one car editor as painfully beautiful | A literal work of art from any angle | Nissan did this right with a ground-up redesign keeping true to the true spirit of this legendary car | Tame enough for daily commutes but it turns into a different car when the tach hits 4K | The interior is a cockpit | The power and steering effortless | My hearts skips faster every time I see it | 
 "words": This is a sweet ride | Better than the 2003 touring coupe model I owned | The 2007 models have more power through the whole rpm band | The car is well balanced and is lots of fun to drive | Yes there are faster cars for the money but this one looks good drives great and is well made | 
 "words": This car blows me away | I've had it up to 160 twice and haven't got the guts to shift into 6th yet | The acceleration is awesome | The cornering is impressive | Drove it from Shreveport LA | to Miami FL | on vacation | I am 55 yrs old and bad back but the ride was superior | No aches or pains from driving | Had a 1969 Chevelle SS 369 stock 325 hp and it would have been no match for the Z | Best car I've ever owned | Running through those six speeds will take your breath away | On the highway it grabs onto the road as it glides effortlessly through the air | The quality of the ride is not reflected in the price | The only thing that would impress me more would be more horse power | 
 "words": I bought a 6spd z but didn't want the hassle of shifting in traffic | returned it for the automatic | It is just as exciting Great looks plenty of power looks and drives like it should cost more excellent value | 
 "words": Motor a lot faster then my 2003 fun to drive seat quality is a little poor but still a lot of fun on the twisties | great on the track and everyday driving | 
 "words": This is the ideal sports car for its price | The handling is very in touch with the road while body roll remains minimal | The unique exhaust note long legged 6 speed transmission and scare your girlfriend power under your right foot make this car a fun drive | 
 "words": I just bought a new 2007 350Z Touring Roadster | What an awesome car | I have owned several Nissan cars | Altima Sentra Spec V and now a 350Z | The Spec V was great but the 350Z is no comparison | Fuel economy is what I expected for a sports car | 
 "words": This is by far the best car I have owned and I have owned pretty serious horsepower cars | This thing is a blast to drive it turns heads and it feels good handling wise | 
 "words": I have had some issues with the clutch which I have had to take back to the dealership for warranty repair | The clutch was sticking to the floor | They fixed it but it still grinds when trying to shift into 2nd 5th and 6th gear too fast | So I still need to find the time to get that fixed | Other than that I love the car | 
 "words": The car is an absolute hoot to drive | The biggest problem I have with it is that I should have spent the extra money to go with the second level trim to get the cruise and traction control | Nissan should include those two devices and the extra air bags on every Z they sell even if it means adding a little more to the base price | It would make a big difference especially given the high performance status of this vehicle | Remember it's not just for looks this car already has the eye appeal it's a safety issue and that should be at the top of all other considerations | Nissan wake up and get with the program | 
 "words": This is my first Z I had a 97 240sx with an SR20 turbo motor in it | The 350Z is much faster and reliable | I love the Bose sound system and the wheels | Wonderful car and the bigest bang for the buck | 
 "words": It is a great car for a price tag under 30000 | I would not spring for a loaded model that puts the price tag close to 40000 | Would rather get in to a Corvette or Porsche Cayman | Definitely a performance oriented car that comes with less than great fuel consumption and a tight but pleasant interior | Have not gotten close to the advertised fuel rating | The car only sees city driving so that could be the reason | 
 "words": Beautiful car very athletic handling and performance | I have leather navigation and bluetooth | This car exceeded my expectations | 
 "words": The 2007 Z is a joy to drive | The last Z that a drove was an '05 | I also owned a 2006 G35 coupe | There is a huge difference from both of those vehicles to the 2007 350Z with the new engine especially in the the power road handling performance | I have owned and driven a lot of cars Infiniti M45 w 340hp AcuraTL TypeS etc | Nothing even begins to compare in the speed and handling department | I love it | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Z | Had a 2003 350Z Touring and there is no comparison | The improvements that they've made were right on target | Engine is stronger interior is more comfortable and better looking | Loved my old car absolutely ecstatic about the new one | If Nissan keeps making them I'll keep buying them | 
 "words": I am extremely happy I chose the Z | Mine is black with a soft top | The lines are sleek and powerful | The factory rims are phenomenal | My colleague owns a 911 and I wouldn't trade rims with him for anything | The ride is smooth and the engine is extremely responsive | Honestly the car is almost too quick for me but I am steadily getting acclimated | I love the car and I would recommend it over any of the other roadsters I see floating around the roadways | 
 "words": I owned a 2004 350Z and traded for a 2007 | I am very impressed with the upgraded interior and the solid engine performance | I had looked at other sports cars e | g | porsche corvette and feel very good about this choice | This is perhaps the best sports car in terms of cost and performance |
