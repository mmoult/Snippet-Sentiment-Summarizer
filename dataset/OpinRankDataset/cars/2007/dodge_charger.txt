 "words": I love the look and performance of my 2007 Dodge Charger SXT | However transmission problems have come to light that make this vehicle very unsafe | While traveling on the highway and accelerating to pass the transmission has locked up or something and the car loses power | I have had to coast to the side of the road stop the car and restart it to reboot the computer | 
 "words": Great car | Coming from a Mazda 626 '01 and prior an '01 Focus the interior is spacious | I have a couple of bigger home boys and they sit comfortably | After the dealership threw in some 20 black and chrome rims it looks great with my gray and black tinted windows | Wish I could have afforded the V-8 but when gas was 4 | 75 a gallon I knew it was a good buy | Very quick off the start | My wife can easily fit all our kids in there which is nice when I have to use the Durango for the snow | I highly suggest it whether it be the V-6 to the Daytona version the Charger is the way to go | I have driven the Daytona and boy that is a car to be driven
 "words": I bought the R T with 33000km so far did 2 oil changes at the dealer the car is amazingly quiet and comfortable on the highway Chrysler did a good job air-sealing this beast | Even on local roads when idling you can barely hear that the engine is running | i get 8 L 100 km on the highway and about 15 L 100 km local every time i fill it i get an average displayed around 13 L 100 km now remember I drive agressively so it's higher than regular | I did quite a bit of research before purchasing and it's the best purchase i've ever made in my life | 
 "words": I have been driving my SRT8 Charger everyday for over a year now and I am still in love with this car | I am retired and do not have to drive but if I look at my car I want to take it for a ride | The gas prices stopped that desire for a while so I learned how to drive the speed limit | The car is still jumpy as ever and if not for the brake dust and the fact that the Goodyear RSA's lasted a good year 18 months I would have no complaints | 
 "words": Fun car to drive but is expensive to maintain after 40000 miles | Fans go out and transmission has problems | Things that you should not have problems with at this mileage are failing | I had a 95 Chevy Impala SS that did not cost as much to maintain and I kept it until 125000 miles | If looking to buy just remember it is a DODGE | 
 "words": 1 year ago when I first bought my 2007 Charger SE used with 18k miles on it I was driving 100 miles a day | Now its been 50k miles | I have loved driving it for every minute | My one complaint I think I've started to hear a tiny squeak in the passenger compartment | It's the bare-bones model with the 2 | 7 L engine so I get fantastic gas mileage | The only repairs have been the front wheels and suspension after a blow-out |

 "words": I bought my 3 | 5 SE brand new from the dealership after an amazing test drive | It has the basic package but that was my choice | I'm 26 years old 6'4 high and 300 lbs heavy I reside in the UAE where temps reach up to 122 50 c in the shade and humidity up to 100 and my Charger has no trouble handling all that | Had it for a year now and no troubles what so ever | great value for money and the a c unit is absolutely fantastic it cools down the interior within minutes Very comfortable visibility is great despite thick A and C pillars cos the mirrors cover it all | I've driven lots of cars Saab Honda Mitsubishi Toyota BMW and none of them matches the performance of my 3 | 6 V6 Charger
 "words": I've read the other reviews and can't believe that no one has mentioned that it's hard to see the traffic light because of the low window | Overhead lights hard to see have to duck down | You have to look at the traffic light to the left in Chicago | The R T drives like it just wants to keep going and never stop | It really takes off on the highway | City driving in Chicago is about 16 17 mpg | Haven't taken the care on a trip but am sure the multiple displacement cylinders would do wonders for mileage |
