 "words": My company provided me this S60 | If it were my money I would not buy one | It is a fine highway car with wonderful straight-line acceleration and a comfortable driver's seat | The S60 is not good on curves and in corners its weight and vague steering adversely influence the handling and do not inspire confidence | After 29350 miles the only problems I have had are a loose passenger side door seal fixed during an oil change service and a rattle that I cannot locate by the passenger door frame | Passenger seat is awkwardly oriented and uncomfortable on long trips | seems to place passenger at an angle within the car |

 "words": The seats in this car are extremely comfortable | The layout of the dash is very user friendly and ergonomic | The heated seats were excellent | The sound system HU650 sounds superb | Few parts are flimsy | Rattles too much | Could be a smoother ride | Very quite | Too much curb weight when taking corners | Very fast car | Slow at first but once at about 35 mph this car accelerates very smoothly | The turbo is amazing | Makes passing cars on the highway a pleasure | Extremely comfortably ride at 70 mph | Excellent car could handle just a bit better | 
 "words": I have been driving my S60 AWD since July of 2007 | I drive from northern New England to New York City and back every other week | This car has held up well | My fuel economy seems fine I don't pay very close attention | The comfort of the seats has remained solid the electronics still work fine in short everything is still in working order | It has handled very well in snow sleet conditions though I recommend engaging the W option when doing so | The trunk storage is pretty good the rear seats while comfortable don't have a boatload of legroom for adults | When I got this I was considering the BMW 3 Series the S60 and the Saab 9-3 | I am still very happy I decided to get the S60 | 
 "words": It's been a year and I'm even more impressed and pleased with my purchase | Went on a couple of road trips from MA to VA on I95 through major cities like Stanford NYC DC Richmond | 31MPG Impressive | The comfort of the driving position is wonderful | I am reminded of the line from a competitor | when you turn your car on does it return the favor | In this case a resounding yes | Climate seating interior quality reliability all excellent | Engine purrs at night | Had two service visits and the only thing changed were indicator bulbs | 1 year and 16000 miles later I am happy with my choice | 
 "words": I walked into the dealership to purchase a 2008 V40T5 and found none available in the South Florida area | I was called back to see this car a loaner demo with the Premium and Sport packages | One test drive later I was an owner | Over the years I have owned every premium brandand this is a great blend for the money | 
 "words": I purchased my Volvo S60 T5 back in July | I couldn't be more happy with the car | The included features are excellent | It is a sporty sedan that is definitely fun to drive | You owe it to yourself to at least give it a test drive | I drove a half dozen cars when I was shopping around and the S60 was by far the nicest car for the price | 
 "words": Vehicles are my hobby and I've owned over 60 new ones from basics AMC Gremlin to exotics Lotus Esprit MB E55 AMG Saleens | I traded my 2006 BMW M3 convertible 6 speed manual for a 2007 Volvo S60 R automatic | The S60 R is my favorite vehicle ever | 
 "words": Purchased the car with 1500 miles on it in September | Impressed with the comfort of the front seats although the back seat legroom can be a bit tight for those over six feet | Instrumentation is handy and functional | The car responds well in passing situations and seems to hug the road with no problems | No rattles or shakes noted to date | The design of the car is sporty w o being presumptuous | I enjoy the fact the the car is not as common as the BMW and Lexus | 
 "words": The best value in an all-around performance street car | Superb brakes | Car feels noticeably lighter than it is when driven hard in the mountains or on the track | More fun to drive with DTSC on because of active yaw control | Ignore most of the negative comments of some other reviewers | The R has vented brake rotors the gas cap is on the side of the car away from traffic so it's not wrong there is a 6 CD changer option turn the radio off for mute duh the key fob opens the trunk if you press the trunk button twice like it says in the manual bad design but it's right there in the book and if you unlock the doors the trunk opens with the touch of a button | 
 "words": I've had my R for about 6 months and couldn't be happier | I was a little nervous after reading some of the edmunds reviews but can honestly say I have been thrilled thusfar | I got mine with the sport package | I like many was looking at the IS350 and the GS | This is a hoot to drive not as throaty and braggadosia as the Infinit and feels bigger inside at least the front seat than the lex | 
 "words": Sports package really makes a difference | I test drove a premium without the sport upgrade and was disappointed | When mine arrived on the back of a carrier with 2 | 7 miles and a surprise sports package I was delighted | 
 "words": My new S60 R is a pleasant surprise from a company known more for safety than performance | With 300 hp this car really moves and with AWD I have the confidence to push it farther than I might otherwise | I originally was looking for a mid large sedan like the Charger R T Impala SS Maxima and Mazdaspeed6 | After driving all these vehicles it was clear the Volvo was in a different class and was exactly what I was looking for | 
 "words": We bought this car in 2005 the first year the R was available | After much research it came down to the Audi A4 BMW 3 series Mercedes C Class and the Volvo S60R | After a test drive in each the Volvo was the clear winner | Faster pickup more solid build quality | The BMW and MBenz felt like toys compared to this | The Audi was nice but had now where near the OOMPH | AWD was a must for us living in the Northeast | We have driven it over 45000 miles now in the city and highway with no major mechanical issues | This is the 2nd one we owned yes I was the first person in the United States to total an R | Major rollover accident | WE ALL WALKED AWAY WITHOUT A SCRATCH | Volvo saved my life | 
 "words": Just got into this vehicle after much research 1 yr | It came down to S60 vs | TL | S60 won because of cabin comfort incredible | fold flat rear seats 8-way passenger seating hand-brake location driver side Regular fuel Trunk capacity | Overall I'm very satisfied with the ride | Makes you feel like driving all day | It's been 14 years since I've driven a new car came from a 93 Integra which is the best car in the world | It's going to take some time getting use to all this new technology | Will keep you posted | 
 "words": This car is lightning fast stable and comfortable on long drives | The best of both worlds in terms of a sports car with coupe lines that you can live with and bring along friends | Great stereo phenomenal seats this car fits me better than anything else I have ever driven | 
 "words": What a ride beating out the Lexus IS 250 Acura TL and BMW 3 series this is the best car if you want a flexible car fun when it needs to be and luxurious when you want it to be | Added spoiler Premium Package and Sport Package makes for a very sleek looking and luxuriously appointed car | Many positive comments about the interior and exterior fit and finish | Geartronic transmission a nice feature like other posters I thought that the pedal response was a bit slow on the highway before I realized I was doing close to 90 mph | Excellent pickup under 40 mph consistently | It moves with any pedal pressure immediate response | Very satisfied buyer | 
 "words": I am shocked that this vehicle is allowed to be sold after so many service related issues | My transmission has gone out the shocks have gone out the wheel bearings have gone out the engine needs oil every 800 miles | I have driven a loaner more than this car | Volvo is very unresponsive probably because they are owned by FORD | 
 "words": Car was delivered with 2 defective rear shocks Dealer could not replace them because they are on national backorder | After a month they received replacement units they were installed Brought car back to dealer | The replacements were also defective
 "words": This car is sneaky fast | Passing on the interstate seems lethargic until you realize you're going 80 90 MPH | The day after I bought it I drove 2000 miles round trip from Augusta GA to Houston TX and obtained an overall 29 MPG | Volvo recalibrated the engine computer so the car runs on regular gas | I'm pleased to report there are no rattles and very little wind noise | It seems solid and has very comfortable seats but has a somewhat harsh ride | The turn radius will drive you crazy especially in mall parking lots | Overall nice car but I'm seriously disappointed in Volvo's depreciation rate much higher than Japanese automobiles | 
 "words": Exceptional | Fun car but not an ostentatious sports car | Compared to Infiniti G35 Audi S4 and BMW 330 | Surprising power | Tight handling with the advantage of variable All-Wheel Drive | No problems with the R in mountain snow | Get this w a manual transmission for maximum fun | Great finishing touches on interior gauges and electronics | Hwy fuel economy better than 30 MPG | Overall good value for performance | 
 "words": My daughter was in a serious accident in my 2003 S-60 | She was hit from behind by a truck while at a red light | The car was totaled she was fine | I leased a 2007 the next day and found it better than the 03 The turbo is very peppy the handling on the awd is excellent and the dtsc is great in wet weather | I would highly recommend this car | Fuel mileage is also very good on regular gas | 
 "words": I love this car | It has all the class and safety of a volvo but it is also very quick and sporty | I have the black sapphire with black interior with the sport package | 
 "words": Wonderful driving experience | Compared it against the Acura TL BMW 3 series hands down the Volvo is the car to own | 
 "words": Amazing car | Incredibly quick amazing exterior and interior looks amazing sound system gages are beautiful powerful brakes sharp rims soft and easy clutch AWD system definitely keeps the car grounded | An huge bargain for its price compared to its counterparts | Definitely go overseas delivery if you have the chance nothing beats zipping by BMW's on the autobahn | 
 "words": My transmission conked out after 2000 miles | I have not yet received any explanation or a repair | I am disgusted with the car and with Volvo | Also the handling on my old VW Passat is Much better | 
 "words": Initially I got the car b c I could not pass up the great lease deal | This car has great pickup for a 200 HP engine is very roomy and comfortable | It has a firm drive and is has very responsive handling | Interior lags behing Lexus but is respectable | 6 airbags in the car is a plus | 
 "words": The new Volvo S60 2 | 5T is a terrific vehicle | I have owned Audi 6 and Lincloln LS prior to this and have found the Volvo to be more comfortable better pick-up interior design to be well built and the leather sport seats are most comfortable of any car ever driven | the exterior lines rival the Audi A 6 | The only negative found is in the turning radius | otherwise this car combines significantly better safety terrific seats and exterior design as well as any competitively priced and or higher priced autos |
