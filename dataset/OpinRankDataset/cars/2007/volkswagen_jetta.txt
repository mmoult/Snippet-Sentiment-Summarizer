REVIEWS
 "words": Purchased this 07 Jetta 2 | 5L 5cyl 2 yrs ago brand new has been a very good car handles great on highway | Have had to replace the gas tank door on warranty | The bad thing is I have to buy the Catrol full synthetic oil at AutoZone along with filter for local mechanic to change the oil | Love the 10k mile oil change intervals | This car has been A excellent compared to our old 2003 Passat which was a nightmare since assembled in Germany compared to the Passat in Mexico | Car is very sporty sometimes catches people's eye | 
 "words": This is my third VW and my second GLI and it has not disappointed | I love the car and even the bright yellow color though it wasn't my first choice | One of the other reviewers a fellow Nebraskan had trouble in the snow | I have not | I bought snow tires for the winter and didn't have any trouble at all | The DSG transmission would get 'stuck' when first starting out in very cold temperatures but otherwise no mechanical problems at all | 
 "words": I have a 2007 VW Jetta and I have to say that I have had the worst experience possible with this car | I have had the fan replaced with in the first year of purchase rear rotters and brake pads replaced only at 43000 which cost 400 | I have had electrical problems with the vehicle numerous times | Had to take it in for repair when the transmission started slipping out of gear | For some strange reason the tires had issues holding pressure even though VW said nothing was wrong | but yet the tire pressure light kept coming on | The dealership gave me a list of what they call normal maintenance for 43000 miles | Here it is Pollen Filter Gas Filter Spark Plugs ect | ect | 2000 total | Hate car
 "words": Amazing this car drives realy great looks great very very fast front seats are comfortable rear seats I give them 50 gear shift is so smooth easy | I love it 
 "words": Had to replace pads and rotor only at 15K miles | Dealer said that this is normal | I just think 15K is still not that much miles to worry about your brakes | My other cars usually get up to about 30K to 35K miles | The repair is also very costly | 419 | This is my first time to own a VW and probably my last too | The car drives great though but maintaining it would be quite expensive | 
 "words": This is a great car for the price | I bought it pre-owned and consistently drive it everyday | The car now has 38000 with no problems knock on wood | The steering on this car is tight and hugs the road | None of the other cars I test drove such as the mazda3 and corolla could compare to the solid feel the Jetta has | This is a classy looking car and it turns heads not to mention it's fun to drive | If you want a good looking car with style and great steering get this car-you won't be sorry | 
 "words": I have had the car for 25000 trouble free miles now and have enjoyed all the car has done for me | Installed drop in kn filter in place of factory filter and this helps car to breath better and gives car better tip in throttle response especially when a c is in operation | Replaced rear pads at 23000 miles which should be covered under warranty but is not | VW needs to cover this issue under warranty | As long as you take your vw to dealer to be serviced and drive it in low rpm range when cold you should not have problems with this car as I have had no problems with my previous jettas | Also volkswagens aren't supposed to stand and warm up drive off immediately after starting | 
 "words": I have had the car for 2 yrs | And I have already had to replace the clock spring in the steering wheel | The rear pads wear out so fast do to to abs and electronic stability control | It controls the the car by applying the rear brakes
 "words": Overall the car has been reliable but several problems have developed | First it developed a bad smell due to mold in the A C condensor | Lysol didn't work so I had to take it apart and clean it with bleach | Now we turn the A C off a few miles before arriving at our destination and let the condensor dry | Then the lifts on the trunk wore out which means the lid doesn't automatically open anymore | The third problem is a mild ticking sound from an exhaust manifold leak | It's not too bad since I can only hear it when accelerating moderately onto the freeway | Fortunately it doesn't appear to be getting worse | I'm debating if I should take it to the dealer lest something else get screwed up | 
 "words": This is my dads car | I drive it all the time but i also drive my moms 2007 rabbit which I prefer to drive | The Jetta just doesn't stop like the rabbit at all | And it doesn't accelerate | The steering is almost the same but not quite as good as the rabbit | Overall I think that it is a good car but not great | 
 "words": I just purchased my first VW Jetta and it rocks the Wolfsburg Edition is really handy with the heated seats | At first I thought I had no reason to have them until I turned them on during a cold front | I tell you you can't have leather seats without them | The same goes for the sunroof at first I thought I've never had one so who cares but now that I have used it is a great option to have | Thanks VW for the hard work in creating and evolving the Jetta for today's environment | 
 "words": This is our first VW since owning a Scirocco in the late 80's | We have the 2007 Jetta Wolfsburg Edition with the 6-speed automatic | We love the styling ride power and fuel economy of this car | But in the terms of safety this car is fantastic with front and rear side curtain airbags | I hope we will not have to use them but if so they're there | The power is quite adequate and we have already taken a few trips in this car and the ride is quite comfortable | Also the heated seats are a very nice edition on those cold days | The rear seat and trunk room are very nice as well as we love to travel and can fit much luggage in the cavernous trunk | All in all this car is a great addition | 
 "words": Simply put this is a car of great compromise | This is my first VW | I wanted to reduce my operating costs due to rising fuel prices in the middle of 2006 | Therefore the Jetta was considered | I am really glad I got one | It will be used as a commuter car that will get 100 miles per day put on it | As of today it has about 8000 miles | I am getting 28 MPG mostly freeway 72 MPH average with cruise control and regular unleaded | I use Mobil 1 synthetic 0- 40 wt oil | Although the 5-cyl | engine lacks a little torque in the low RPM range the 5 valve head runs pretty decent if you need to put your foot in it above 3000 RPM | I am 6' 1 205 lbs and find the Jetta to have great comfort | 
 "words": Driving the 2007 Jetta is like driving a sporty luxury car | It comes with every option that I would want | 
 "words": This is my second Jetta and I have to say that VWs to me are better than my Toyota Tacoma and Corolla put together | That's why I went back to driving a Jetta | I also feel much safer than in my Toyotas | 
 "words": This car is a great car to drive | It handles pretty nicely | Its shifting is crisp | Just be careful you could break 100 mph without even noticing | 
 "words": When I searched for my first new car I had focused on Honda as I have had good experiences with Hondas previously | However I was pleasantly surprised with the VW Jetta | It is small on the outside and big on the inside there's plenty of space for passengers and storage | It's a lot of fun to drive | The only drawback it has is it gets lower gas mileage than I would like | I can justify this by attributing the lower gas mileage to a heavy car body which serves as an excellent safety feature | 
 "words": The 2007 Jetta is a very appealing car but I don't like driving it | The ride is very rigid and feels like riding in an old beat up truck | 
 "words": This is not a sexy car but it offers good service and comfort at a very favorable value | The People's Car
 "words": Right off the lot I my Jetta needed a wheel alignment | The car moves from side to side going down the road after the alignment | I am being told that is the way the car drives | I have received bad customer service to the point that nobody cared | Now it is three weeks later and the sunroof leaks | This car has 3000 miles on it | Look twice before buying one | 
 "words": This is really a great car it is fun to drive has a very smooth ride and handles turns and corners very well | It picks up speed very fast and the Tiptronic transmission is great for people who like to drive | I am very impressed that Volkswagen has taken the initiative to make so many safety features standard and my insurance went DOWN after purchasing a brand new car | It is great I love the styling and it's just a lot of fun | 
 "words": I bought this car and was happy with it until I started driving it further than a few blocks and winter came | It has no comfortable seating position | Also the defroster does not heat the bottom part of front window which leads to snow and ice buildup under the wipers | The transmission whine makes it sound like police are always present when it's not grinding its gears | I used to have a V6 and the average gas mileage on that was nearly 20 better than I get on this car though EPA ratings show it the other way around | 
 "words": This car is a very good deal | It comes with ESP and all of the safety equipment top crash and dynamic safety ratings for 17500 | I like the car overall | Its front seat comfort is only so-so for me but the ride is very good | Its performance is fine but its gas mileage is just OK | Nothing feels better at highway speeds any speed you choose than a VW | That makes them great cruisers | For the money it's quite a deal | 
 "words": This car has excellent fit and finish with upscale materials | The poor man's BMW is back with Class | Our other car is a Chrysler 300 and the Jetta has a smoother quieter ride | We went with the 5-speed for the sports sedan fun but the auto transmission with sports shift was a strong contender | The exterior styling is a little bland our neighbor thought it was a Corolla and it reminds me of an old Altima | It has a smooth shift but the quiet engine makes it easy to stall | Ironic huh | The multi-adjustable console armrest is great | So far I would choose this car all over again | 
 "words": The Jetta Wolfsburg is similar to the 2 | 5 trim but adds a sunroof convincing faux leather seats rear center armrest alloy wheels and floor mats in addition to the cold weather package | It is available in black white silver and gray | Its understated exterior styling belies the quality of the interior | It's even more impressive at night | Soft touch materials are used extensively and even if you find hard plastic it has a solid quality feel | The exception being the paper-like shift boot | The ride is firm yet very compliant excellent road manners | Its acceleration is acceptable from stop but highway passing is effortless to a flaw watching for flashing lights is compromised by rear visibility | 
 "words": I recommend VW as a brand to anybody | They are great cars that hold up forever | They are smooth riding safe and they look nice without being snotty | I really love this car | 
 "words": I love the car | I had a great experience with the dealership and service has been great | 
 "words": This is a nice ride | It's quite inside and has a nice shifting transmission | It handles well at speeds and through mountain corners | It delivers great power at all RPM | It is far nicer than my '95 Mercedes 300CE | VW has come a long way | 
 "words": I brought the car home to my wife she hated 4-door cars until I put her in it and she wanted it | In the past she has always had coupes | 
 "words": I purchased a 2007 VW Jetta 2 | 5L | I like the looks of the Jetta from the outside more than I do the inside | Overall it is nice and fun to drive | It is a good vehicle for the money | I didn't look at any other car except for the Honda Civic but didn't like its new body | 
 "words": This car is stunning to look at and has loads of power with the Tiptronic transmission and sports mode providing a whole lot of thrills | It has a surprisingly spacious interior and more than enough room for three sets of golf clubs | The standard 6 disc sound system is impressive and the leatherette seats are almost as good as the real thing and far better than cloth | The fuel economy is excellent | It's a lot of fun to drive and can fit into virtually any parking space | I'm seriously considering buying another one for my wife | 
 "words": I drive a lot | On average I spend about 50 minutes in my car daily | I'm currently at 25000 miles on my '06 Jetta | It's been a year since I purchased my spice red Volkswagen Jetta and I'm still very pleased with my decision | Although it was not my first choice I find it to be a beautiful car that is strong and enjoyable | On a separate note the dealership is not as helpful | It is the only dealership that offers Jettas in my area so I have no choice | The service department has been very rude to me on one issue | Still overall I love my car | 
 "words": This is a great vehicle to drive | It's fun and sporty but also very safe and economic | Great job Volkswagen | 
 "words": I really like this car I think the exterior styling which is considered bland by some is sort of sporty and elegant and it shares the same large chrome grille feature as VW's luxury counterpart Audi | The car handles very well and I have the base 2 | 5L 5-cylinder engine which may not be race car fast but does the job | I notice that the car is very heavy for its class and I like this as it helps keep the car feeling more stable at highway speeds | 
 "words": This car drives and handles well | It's fun to drive and is nicely appointed but it's the most expensive Jetta package costs over 25000 | Trading in a '01 V6 fully loaded Passat I didn't want to give up any extras | The new styling is great and the upgraded 17 wheels make the car stand out | I did not test drive the car on the interstate before buying | big mistake | The road noise is very noticable much louder than what I'm used to | I keep turning up the radio to compensate | If I had it to do over I probably would have looked more at a midsize car and checked for a quieter ride | If you're looking for a small car and can get past the road noise it's a nice car | 
 "words": I bought this car for the looks even after hearing about problems with this car | I am so happy with this car and all it hasdone for me | I live where it snows 3 to 4 months out of the year and it dose a great job | I get 30mpg on the open road | And this car has a fit and finsh of a 40000 car | I am sorry to say that I sell cars for a living and I did not buy some thing I sell | Happy Happy Jetta Owner
 "words": I've owned this car for two years now and I love it | I haven't had any problems with it at all | I take it to the dealership for the normal service intervals and things are going well | I love all the features the heated seats sunroof and overall feel of the interior | 
 "words": Bought this car when I retired | Overall nice car for it's class | Enjoy driving | The 30m oil change service was about 300 | Wife's Volvo was about same cost | Dealer note on bill needed to have rear brake job done est 300 to 350 | I've owned many cars in my lifenever remember having a brake job on any | Not happy with this | 
 "words": I have leased this Jetta and I think it is a great-looking car and fun to drive | when it isn't snowing or wet | I'm not sure what the issue is | I've driven in NE snow weather for 20yrs and this is THE WORST car I have had for snow | If there is some magic button I need to press I wish someone would let me know | The dealer here is terrible | it takes forever to get an oil change | My trunk lift broke 4mos after getting the car and the dealer had the nerve to ask what did you do to it | Like I took a bat to it or something | They weren't going to repair the foot long scratch to the paint on the inside of the lid because it didn't show | I'm not sure if I would get a VW again | 
 "words": My 2007 Jetta at 27000 miles had to have rear pads replaced and rotors turned | Dealer says this is normal for this car | Cost of repair was 270 dollars | I see nothing normal about this | Seems very premature for brake job and very expensive | 
 "words": I have driven my 2007 Jetta with 5 sp manual for 42K miles without any issues | It get's serviced at my VW dealer only at the required intervals | I follow the dealer service recommendations | I love this car | I have it detailed every 4 months | I drive between NY and Pittsburgh every 4 to 6 weeks and love the comfort and reliability this car has provided me | This is my 3rd VW having had a 2000 Passat and a 2003 Jetta TDI | Both I drove over 200K miles | 
 "words": Purchased my Jetta new it now has 21000 miles | Haven't had any problems and only had one recall which was not a safety issue and only took a few minutes to fix | Dealer service is always good and quick but can be expensive although I don't mind paying more for fast service thats done right the first time | Car has been very reliable so far looking forward to putting a lot of miles on it after it's paid off | 
 "words": About six months after I bought my car my first car ever the splash shield separated from the bumper and crumbled into a million pieces on the freeway | I took it to the dealer and they said that my insurance should pay for it and that this happens all of the time because the European make of the car causes it to catch on US parking curbs | I went to my insurance agent and they said they weren't going to pay for it because it wasn't due to an accident | I had to pay 1800 in repairs out of my own pocket | I have since had problems with my driver's side door and my brakes almost didn't stop my car on a hill | Expect to apply a large amount of pressure on your brakes to stop at high speeds | 
 "words": As I read through the reviews I agree with the brake issue | I had to replace my rear left brake system completely at about 10K miles | The rear caliber seized and wore down my pads and bent the rotors | I am now close to 18K and having another brake issue | I have had 2 other cars of which I put well over 100K each and did not run into this problem | If it were not for this problem I would say the car is great | Awesome handling and great pickup | Very comfortable on long road trips | Just fix the brake issue | 
 "words": Not a bad car overall | But I guess some lucky few including me have experienced defective brakes | I had to replace the rear pads and rotors at 21000 miles and now again 9000 miles later | VW claims this is normal wear and tear | I've owned and driven many cars and never had to replace pads let alone rotors before 40000 miles | There is no brake wear indicator light for the rear brakes only for the front | The rotors are designed so that they have to also be replaced every time the pads are replaced | Very expensive | 
 "words": Overall the car is ok | I'm one of the unlucky few that has brake problems | I had to replace the rear brakes and rotors at 9849 miles | I'm still fighting to get it done under warranty | The brake sensor is only for the front brakes so you will find out too late that your rear brakes need replacing | 
 "words": After test driving some Japanese makes you can imagine which ones I finally made it to the VW dealer and it felt like I had been driving go- karts all day | This felt so solid and drove so well | I loved the tiptronic transmission and the VW signature blue and red display on the dashboard | The mileage this car gives is also very respectable | This was the last car I test drove | The 6'6 salesman opened the driver's door wide open when we got back to the dealer hung himself from the door for about 7 seconds and then closed the door | It closed as if nothing had happened | He looked at me smiled and said Do not try this on a Japanese | I thought this was a funny remark | I love my Jetta | 
 "words": I have been reading everyone's reviews about how they love this car | Personally I have not had a good experience | I have had a knocking noise that sounds like it is coming from the dash on the passenger side that sounds off every 1 min and 15 sec | The airbag warning light stays on the brake warning light stays on the signal warning light stays on and periodically the power steering light comes on and the steering acts crazy | I have already replaced the rear brakes at 20000 miles when supposedly the rear brakes only get used 25 of the time | I have already been to the dealer twice | I need a car that I can depend on as a single mother and this car is definitely not it | 
 "words": This is MY first VW and my family's twelfth so I am a little biased on my love for the car | The fit and finish is luxury level the ride quality is for me close enough to my old 3- series BMW that I can't justify the added expense of the BMW anymore | The only complaint I have is the rear brakes which seems to be a common complaint here | I will say this though having had to replace the pads nearly every oil change I will continue to pay for that hydraulic braking system | That braking system has saved my life on LA freeways more times that I care to admit | This is one of those cases of parts bin engineering but when your parts bin is hand-me-downs from Porsche | 
 "words": This is my 3rd VW the first two being a Beetle and Super Beetle I bought back in 1969 and 1973 | I've forgotten how much fun VW's are to drive | This car seems quicker than the posted times with smooth as silk shifting | Brakes are going strong after 20K miles | Awesome Ride | 
 "words": Always liked the Bug when I was growing up so when it was time to buy a new car in 2006 we took a chance on the new Jetta | The car is awesome in every way | Looks handling reliability everything | The car is built for people who like to drive it is so fun | Got into a bad accident with it earlier this year not a scratch on me plus its fixed and like new | Love it | 
 "words": The rear brakes are design to be replace Pads Rotors every 15000 miles no matter how much you use them | I use this as a commute car and I will never buy a VW again because of this issue | I like the car but I can NOT believe that VW has this problem and will not correct it | This is an on going problem from the 2000 | If you hear a thud in the rear brake area you have a problem that will cost you 400 | 00 because you have to replace the ROTOR and PADS | This is not something on a car any brand or model | 
 "words": The GLI is great vehicle I love the way this car handles shifting is smooth gas mi 30 mpg hwy | Hard to stay under 70 | Best vw I've ever owned | 
 "words": I travel around 3000 miles a month | Exceptionally comfortable ride | Great handling | MPG is ok | It is less than other cars in it's class but that is too be expected as it is a little heavier and built with safety in mind | So I'll exchange a few MPG for peace of mind with safety | 
 "words": This is my 5th Jetta and there are a few major issues | The car failed to start 3 times and the alarm went off in the middle of the night for no reason | It was an electrical short that took 3 trips to the dealer to fix | The last time it was there for 5 weeks | The center console handles crowd the drivers right leg and they serve no purpose | The gas mileage is not the best or worst but for mileage this low I want a car that is faster | The acceleration is adequate however and I enjoy the fit and finish of the interior and exterior | The trunk and back seats are roomy | Besides the mechanical issues I like the handling | I will not however be purchasing at the end of my lease | 
 "words": Having a ball with this car | The redesign is was very nice and while is may look somewhat bland the lines are nice and compared to previous Jetta's a very nice upgrade | Peppy fun and much bigger too | Like the ride a lot |

 "words": I always wanted a Volkswagen ever since my brother got one | I finally got a jetta wolfsburg and I love it | When you want to hit the ground running it responds immediately | One of the main reasons why I went with this car rather than a Honda is because I love the expensive look of the car the little details and strong sheet metal that holds it all together | I recommend this car to all my friends | 
 "words": Well you may think I'm crazy going from high-performance to economical but this car still holds to the same fun as the EVO 8 w o the speed or the cops always looking your way | I choose the GLI because of it great features it offers the features of a BMW 3 Series without the sticker price and you get all the extras that the EVO didn't have | GREAT gas mileage | The in-dash display that almost tells you everything about your cars status is pretty cool too | I'll miss the HP and torque of my EVO but not the highschool kids always trying to race me | - Good job VW | 
 "words": I was somewhat hesitant to purchase a VW because of everything I had read regarding the quality of the car but I was pretty much sold after a test drive | The 2 | 0T has much better performance exterior styling in addition to what I believe is higher quality interior materials than the other cars I was considering e | g | Accord Camry Altima | The only weakness I can see so far is the fuel mileage and the car's requirement for premium gas | The car has been averaging about 22-23 mpg in mostly city driving | While this is in line with the EPA ratings I had expected better | I haven | t done any long distance highway driving with the car yet so I can | t comment on the highway performance |

 "words": This is our 4th VW | The Jetta is our first new VW | It handles beautifully and has enough power to get into traffic | Test drove a Corolla and Camry the same day we tested the Jetta and the Jetta won hands down just due to the fun factor | Only problem so far is the door latch on the drivers door catching and the outside temp gauge | It uses a little more gas than we expected but the alternative wouldn't be much fun to drive | The sport shift is great | 
 "words": This is my 2nd Jetta 3rd VW in all | My '98 Jetta got well over 30 mpg | My '07 averages 18 mpg | I've been back to my dealership 4 times and they basically tell me 'too bad' | I contact VW Corporate and they told me I have to work with the dealership and that Corporate has nothing to do with it | Overall I love the car except the gas mileage and the lack of power feels like 4 cylinders not 5 | I'm very disappointed in VW on the way they handled this issue |

 "words": Bought new on 8 31 07 returned 9 1 07 for my AC and heating not working | So far VW has had my car for 2 weeks and expects to have my car another 3 weeks due to production problems for the part that my Jetta requires sensor compressor | They say this problem just started occurring in the 2007 models and they aren't equipped to handle the need for so many parts | I'm now sporting a Mercury Sable that I pretend is my Jetta Extremely disappointed in VW but the time I did have it I enjoyed it | Just afraid that I now have a lemon on my hands what brand new car breaks after 1 day | BUYERS BEWARE | 
 "words": Everybody wants to spend their money wisely as do I | If you're in the market for a new or used vehicle this is the way to go | A must see car if you have not before | So many standard features so little price | Check it out and compare to other choices | You will not be disappointed |
