REVIEWS

 "words": I bought this car as basic transportation 2 years ago and it has exceeded my expectations | I average 34 mpg with my 5 speed and have gotten over 40 on the highway | The car is cheap and cheaply built and I miss my Avalanche for durability and quality but I love the gas mileage and the small size | Even as small as it is we never have an issue getting all our stuff in it even when taking three boys to their football games | Several of my friends have Vibes now too after seeing all the things I do with mine | 
 "words": I love the vibe but I always get shocked by the interior everytime I exit the car | And it is very rough | The gas mileage is excellent | I have no idea why but we just had to replace the computer because our check engine light was coming on and they said when it shows the code it was showing GM said to replace the computer so we're hoping that's not an on going problem | The brakes do squeak but not all the time | Over all the vibe is a fun car to own |

 "words": Traded my Ford Explorer in for the the Vibe and I love it much better gas mileage and there I find I have just as much room in the Vibe as I did the Explorer | Although I had to get to used to the front wheel drive I think it handles quite well except when next to big Trucks on the hwy you can really feel the wind pulling | The only problems I seem to be having is with the windows wind seems to howl through drivers side and I think the seal is broken in the hatch back window
 "words": I've been driving a 1998 Dodge Ram truck for 10 years purchased new | Never minded the 17 mpg till last year driving 40 miles one-way to work everyday | Finally decided it was time to look at fuel efficiency | Did all my research and honestly I reluctantly purchased my Vibe just because I really didn't want to drive a car again after driving a truck for so long | I have about 12000 miles on my Vibe now after 6 months of ownership | Never had less than 30 mpg off the dealer lot | Average 30-35 in combo driving | All I can say now is that I LOVE MY VIBE | Roomy fuel efficient smooth riding no mechanical issues so far | Road noise is a little more than expected but no complaints | LOVE IT | 
 "words": I purchased the Vibe with having our first born and for the gas mileage | I've put 27k miles on it so far with no problems | Getting around 34 mpg with 28 mpg in the winter | Like other Pontiacs it is noisy on the highway and wish there was a bit more leg room | But overall I'm very satisfied | Handles great and looks good for a wagon | Very versatile as I can put a variety of stuff inside it | 
 "words": The car is competent | Nothing more nothing less | It handles well but not great fits a good but not great amount of stuff and gets decent but not great gas mileage | The engine is a real weak point | It is very loud but furnishes little power with the autobox | I live up in the Four Corners area so am often above 6000 or 7000 feet | It has a lot of trouble gaining speed on even moderate inclines at altitude | With the AC on or full up with people sometimes it has trouble keeping the same speed | I think the dash design is poor | It looks nice enough but the chrome gauges reflect on the windshield in any sunlight | Its very visible and very annoying | The interior materials are adequate though | 
 "words": I purchased my 2007 Vibe after testing and researching the usual segment competition and the car has been everything I expected | City combined mileage has averaged 27 and more on the freeway in short trips | I really only wanted the base model with an automatic trans and power group added for convenience- so had to search local dealer inventories instead of taking the more expensive models with options I didn't want or need | I found just what I was looking for and after 5 months of ownership the car has been great with no problems | Quality seems good | 
 "words": Ironically I was looking at the Matrix as my final choice | I play the drums so hauling my kit was a big factor | When I saw the room with the seats down I was most impressed | I've put 25000 miles on and have no complaints in fact when I told the service mgr I was looking at a Toyota he said Well this IS a matrix with a Vibe body | I'm getting between 33 and 36 mpg consistently in combo driving |

 "words": Bought this vehicle in Oct '07 after looking at many different cars | Took it on 770 mile trip within 1st week and was surprised at the mileage at the speeds I was driving 75-85mph | Averaged 32 | 5 at 80-85 34 | 5 at 70-75 | Handled great and enjoyed the height adjustment feature on the drivers seat | I purposely ordered the 5spd because of my good luck with my '92 Camry with the same setup and almost the same gas milage but over 200000 miles on the car | Still drive the Camry to work everyday but the milage concerns me on a trip therefore the vibe purchase | Love the way you can use the interior for even long items | Hope I can say the same for this car in 16years and 200k later | 
 "words": Absolutely love this car | This is our primary family vehicle for a family of four and a labrador retriever | The Vibe is a comfortable car to drive and be a passenger in | I am surprised by the amount of backseat room in this car | This car is getting about 35 mpg on the highway if not more and it only costs about 40 a week in gas driving 24000 km a year | Easy to get around the city in and a breeze to park | I would buy another one for sure can't wait for the 2009 model | 
 "words": I bought this car because Consumer Report recommeded it | I cancelled my subscription | The location of the air and heater controls is a nightmae with an automatic | I have large hands | - Also get a scratch on the cheap plastic interior it will never come out | I have never owed such a cheaply made car | Other than that the paint came off the brakes squeal the front seat is a nightmare for comfort Bottom line is that car really SUCKS and G M should be ashamed to sell it |

 "words": I bought this Pontiac Vibe used with 48000 miles on it and purchased an additional 48 month 50000 mile bumper to bumper coverage warranty from my Toyota dealer | I average 27 MPG mostly highway miles but would probably get better mileage if I did not keep the speedo at 80 miles per hour | I love the ride after driving a jittery midsize pickup truck for 6 years | I have owned cars from just about every company out there and I can honestly say I have never been more pleased after 5000 miles of driving | This car meets all of my driving needs and then some | The fit and finish on this 48000 mile car are still as new | I love it | 
 "words": I work out of this car | I get 34 MPG overall including thruway miles at 72 mph and mountain roads | I'm a big guy 5'11'' and 280 pounds there is plenty of headroom and overall the drivers seat is comfortable | I do start to get uncomfortable after 7 hours in the car or trips over 150 miles without getting out | I put the back seats down and carry a full load of product in plastic containers | My product is very light so I don't know how it would be for heavy loads | This model is FWD not AWD | AWD was not available in the 2007 Vibe you would have to buy the Toyota version | Mileage is very important to me and overall I am very happy with this car |
