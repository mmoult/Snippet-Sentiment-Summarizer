 "words": i have had this car for almost 2 years now | when i was first going to buy a car for my wife i test drove many other models in the midsized sedan market | this one stood out for a few reasons a great stereo and a long list of features this is the touring 2 | 4 liter model | first anyone who buys a car for reliability doesn't love cars or even car they just want it to run so don't right a review | this car has had not had a single problem | don't drive it like you stole it and service it and it shouldn't | this car was cheaper than any of the other makes and looks way more expensive | it has more features and if you aren't reviewing the car like ze Germans then then you realize this is a nice car
 "words": Truly is the best car I've ever had | Love the new body style love everything about it | 
 "words": Do not get me wrong this is a really good car the only issue I have with it is the brakes | It seems that the braking system is not strong enough for the car now that might be how they make cars today but its not smart | I found out that I needed brakes at around 10000 miles when I went to stop and the vehicle did not want to and then you heard a horrible grinding noise only to find out that there was nothing left to the pads they had worn down with no notification whatsoever some saftey light would have been nice | Just something to consider | 
 "words": I got this car as a company vehicle last year July 2007 | I have the 2 | 7L V6 engine | I must say the car is very stylish from the outside but basically car is a piece of crap | I took this car in several times to the dealership for various repairs | Problems that stand out for me is the following Car dies intermittenly at low speeds | When making left turns car makes a growling noise | At stops sometimes car sputters then surges forward when foot is on brake | If you don't have to drive it and leave it parked the car get 10's all around | Once you drive it the car gets 1's all around | I will never ever purchase a Chrysler product | No wonder the 3 big American car companies are going out of business | 
 "words": I purchased my 07 Sebring new and put 25K miles in one year | In this time it only needed one minor fix to the trunk release | I have the 2 | 4l 4 cyl and no issues with pep | I'm a bit surprised by some reviews that report lack of pep | I travel a lot and have driven many rental cars with 4 cyl | engines | I don't think any of them have as much go or more power than my Sebring | On the highway it's quite and handles far better than I expected for the price I paid | On one recent highway trip I got 35 mpg doing mostly 70 mph | My only concern is if Chrysler will stay in business to honor the life time power- train warranty that came with my car for no extra cost | 
 "words": I went to a Nissan dealership and drove away with a Chrysler | I'm a college student wanted to get something I wouldn't have to pray would break down on me | Test drove a few Nissans then I test drove the Sebring and then took it home | I love the way the car looks | It's great on gas and the sound system is great | People have been complaining about the pick up I think the car is quite peppy and when I'm on the highway I don't even realize how fast I'm going sometimes | The inside feels sorta like a airplane cockpit but I love my car | I love the gas mileage it rivals a Honda or Nissan | Not bad for an American made car
 "words": I bought the Sebring about a month ago | I absolutely hate this car | It sounds terrible | Never know what noises I'm going to hear each day | Kind of fun to drive but so noisy and uncomfortable it's hard to get past anything else | Please ask if you can take car for a few days and drive before you buy to make sure it's what you want | Wish I would have | Not fun just sick to my stomach that I'm in this car for a long time | I wish I could hire someone to run it off of a cliff | 
 "words": I leased my Sebring when they were brand new to the showrooms | It was a great car that handled well has great features like Sirius satellite radio 6 in dash CD player and most importantly UConnect | I found it so much easier to use than the Trailblazer I had | The four cylinder engine had more than enough power to take us where we were going and in the year and a half I had the car no problems to report | The greatest concern with the car is safety | The car was in an accident which rendered it a complete loss | The car was hit head on and the air bags never went off | Thankfully my children weren't in the car but I did suffer chest pain from hitting the steering wheel | 
 "words": I purchased this vehicle a few weeks ago | Just got my license plate yesterday | I already want to return it | I love this car especially the way it looks | But I'm already experiencing problems | Twice the ignition made a sound when cranking as if the starter was getting ready to quit on me and the brakes makes a funny noise only when I'm backing up | Now today it rained while i was at work and i hear water swishing around in the back my husband says it sounds like it's coming from the back passenger door | It sounds like a LOT of water not a little | Although i'm under warranty i think i'm going to return it and find me something else | Beware of the Chrysler Sebring | 
 "words": I was just getting used to the car driving it back and forth to work one fine day on my way home I stopped at my local home improvement store I got out of the car and walked into the store within minutes my car had caught fire | So be careful there is something going on with this car that Chrysler has not recognized as of yet | If anyone else has had this problem please call Chrysler and inform them of this problem | 
 "words": We own a Ford Freestyle Limited and wanted something smaller like a Camry | I travel a lot and needed better gas mileage | I was amazed when I test drove the Sebring | So glad I did it is great on gas and sporty | I had only owned Toyota's 2 Camry's 1 Corolla and and one Ford which we still have | I love this Chrysler | My two daughters are anxious to drive it when they are old enough they liked the body style as much as I do | This car has been better than I expected | 
 "words": I bought this car with less then 100 mi | Started having problems 2 days after I took it home | Had problems with the check engine light- had to replace the PCP | Had problems with the sunroof spoiler | The car makes noises when you start it and power steering make cluck noises when you turn corners | Took it back to the dealership for the 8th time but they say these problems were just the way the car was built | Please don't buy this car unless you want a noisy car | Looks nice from outside but the engine sounds very loud | I just recently noticed a gaping crack where the bumper meets the rest of the car | Looks to be pulling away | Back to the shop it will go | 
 "words": I was toying with buying a used luxury car and decided to look at a new lesser model | I was impressed with the options this had | I drive a long way to work so the gas mileage was a huge plus | Didn't really care too much about the lack of pick up | This car has just as much options as the used luxury car I was going to get without all the miles | 
 "words": After test driving the following vehicles Dodge Charger Chevy Malibu Hyundai Sonata Mercury Milan twin to Ford Fusion Nissan Altima Mercury Sable I decided on the Sebring | Reason best ride for the money | More substantial with better drive and road handling than the Sonata Milan or Altima | The Charger and Sable are the only ones that could compare to the Sebring | The Charger is very solid but more money and less MPG | The New Sebring introduced in 07 is far better than the old Sebring with improved ride and handling | I purchase the Limited with the four cylinder 2 | 4 L engine | Good power for a four banger and far less noise that the Altima | 
 "words": Bought car nov of 07 | I have taken it on three trips of approx 800 miles gas mileage 34 on hwy and approx 22 city | On the highway very nice cruiser | I have no problems with the 4 cyl pickup is fine | Heater stereo excellent seats are firm but I like that I commute on the thruway with three main mergers and power is fine | Great in the snow | Traded in a Saab 9 | 5 glad I did | 
 "words": I saw this car I thought wow this is a really nice car I like this | I took it for a drive I seemed to really like the feel of the car and was really impressed with the car for the price | What a mistake | I have had nothing but trouble | I have had 4 water leaks in my car and I don't mean little I mean about two inches of water in there | After the fourth time of this they think they have it fixed | My air conditioning has gone out twice and my blinkers blink even when they are not in use | My windshield wipers are tearing up my windshield for the third time as well | I know you are thinking oh she just got a lemon well the dealer said this is about the 15 car with the same problems | 
 "words": I have had this car for about 4-6 months have had it to the shop a lot for electrical problems broken seal on the radiator overflow | It is still under factory warranty as it only had 19000 miles on it when I got it | Carfax had no bad reports on it at all | I am concerned about the electrical problems as they have had to replace the battery 2 different electrical modules with the low number of miles on this | I am wondering what else might happen | It was a one owner car from Alaska there are no records to see what problems they had | Do you think I might have a lemon | John
 "words": This is the worst car ever | I have had nothing but problems since I got it | The dealership where I got it is horrible | Not friendly at all | Way too many problems | There is a long list | I believe that I have had 3 alternators within 3 months of having the car | I would not recommend it | I don't care what other people are saying about it | The worst car ever | 
 "words": This is an awesome car inside and out | Very sporty looking and for a 4door family sedan when paired with the 3 | 5 V6 and 6 speed automatic you tend to forget your driving a family vehicle | The engine is whisper quite and provides plenty of pep around town and on the highway | Be careful 80 feels like 40 | This is my third Chrysler in a row | Before these last three vehicles I was exclusively a European car buyer | I was originally in the market for a Pasat or Audi A4 but the value in the New Sebring Sedan was too much to pass up | Especially considering from the back it looks like an Audi and the side it looks like a BMW
 "words": This is simply a beautiful car inside and out | Meant for being a boulevard cruiser rather than a racecar | Got the touring with every option except leather and got the 2 | 7 V6 for the E85 capability | The engine while somewhat slow sounds really nice and refined and the four speed shifts without making a fuss | This is by far the smoothest car I've ever driven riden in it is my dad's primarily and 90 feels like 40 | 
 "words": I own a 2007 Sebring Limited V6 and I absoloutley love it | This is my first American car I have allways owned Eurpoan vehicles and I like it much better than European or even Japanese | Exceptional audio system by Boston way much better than Bose | 
 "words": We decided to give the Sebring Limited a try as a midsize | The major imports we looked at seemed to be getting bloated and were just plain boringNo spark | The car is just the right size has great styling and handles extremely well | Twisty roads are a real blast with the precision steering and suspension | The 3 | 5l engine has lots of power and has a pleasant tone when you get your foot into it | We've had the car for about 4 months now and it has been trouble free | The build quality is excellent and the interior design is pleasant and unique with high quality material | The seats are very comfortable | We're expecting great service out of this car like our old LHS 100k and no troubles
 "words": A Sebring wasn't even on my next car list several years ago but the redesigned 2007 changed all that | I bought the 3 | 5L V6 for better performance and combined with the 6- speed autostick it doesn't disappoint me | I think it has every option except the moonroof which I didn't want anyway | I love the Inferno Red color with the chrome accents and the interior with the MyGIG navigation system looks sharp | Little things like the nice solid sound and feel of the door closing tells me it's a quality built car | It is so quiet and smooth on the highway | 
 "words":  I felt this was a great buy | I was looking for a good solid car that was good on gas | Being a Chrysler minivan owner I was a little more inclined to be less harsh on the product because I had such good luck with my van | But with that said the Sebring surprised me on looks inside and out | The equipment I have on the car that listed for 22400 | So far it has exceeded my expecatations 
 "words": At the age of 62 and after only God knows how may different cars I have finally found the one I absolutely love | When I bought it I frankly did so for the looks and comfort which are both outstanding | Since then I have grown to love it for the great vehicle it is | I was afraid of getting a 4 cylinder | but decided to go for it for the mileage | I have been happy to find the pickup to be wonderful | I highly recommend it to anyone who wants good looks and great performance | 
 "words": This car is a significant improvement over the last generation | I have the 3 | 5 V6 | It is super-quick and fun to drive | The seats could be a little more comfortable | The gas mileage isn't as great but I wanted the big engine | I like the four-door Crossfire look and the interior design | The Limited is worth looking into if the wallet will let you | Fit and finish could be a shade better but overall an excellent car | 
 "words": The car is very roomy | The gas mileage was a major factor in purchasing the vehicle | Gas mileage averaging around 27 mpg that includes city and highway driving | I got the touring model | First front wheel drive vehicle I owned I like it | I would recomend this vehicle to family and friends | 
 "words": Chrysler has completely outdone themselves with re-designing the 07' Sebring | There isn't much leg room in the back seating area and the sound system wasn't as good as I thought it would be | Other than those 2 minor things | I absolutely love everything about this car and if you're thinking about purchasing one | don't think any more | Go out get your best price and buy it | 
 "words": When looking for a new car I happened upon the Sebring | I started looking at it just for the styling | Then I drove one and fell in love with it | It is a lot of car for the money | I just don't like to buy anything but American and this in my opinion is the best mid-sized American car for the money | I liked the 2 | 7L V6 in the Touring with it's E85 capability and the 18-inch wheels are definitely a plus | It rides like a much more expensive car and it very quiet on the interstate when cruising at 82mph | I am very happy so far with 522 miles driven hopefully many more | 
 "words": My first full tank of fuel averaged me 37 mpg | That is way more than I expected | I like this car for its solid feel and good handling inside trim non glare dash side air bags | I feel the seats are too small and too firm the engineers should be required to test drive for at least a 300 mile trip and that would insure better and more comfortable seats | The engine is noisy going through gears while accelerating but at highway speeds I do not hear it | The trade off for the fuel economy is well worth it | Buy the car | 
 "words": It feels like you are driving a car that costs a lot more | The ride is very smooth | Acceleration is very good for a four cylinder | The trip computer reads as high as 35mpg | But I calculated mileage myself and I'm getting 32 | 5 | I drive 90 highway | 
 "words": I've had this car for about a week and I am pleasantly surprised | The touring model has tons of standard features that are options in other cars | 
 "words": we were looking for a new vehicle | but we were not ready to jump up quite yet to a SUV | for obvious reasons | lets just say I'm a bigger dude and the touring was a nice jump up in size from our honda accord sedan | the 17 inch wheels made it a little easier to get in and out | great ride | 
 "words": We bought ours a few weeks ago and really enjoy the ride | This is a very quiet vehicle with plenty of space and leg room | Good handling | Still getting used to the width since I've driven a jeep for the last 6 years | 
 "words": The 2007 went in a wind tunnel all holes got plugs and heavy glass triple door seals | So quiet | 
 "words": Very smooth ride | It feels like a luxury car | Much improved over my 2004 model | By getting the smaller engine I was able to spend a little more on the interior features | 
 "words": This is my 1st new car third car I've owned in my lifetime | I love this car | I bought it right when the midwest snow storms started and it handles very well | The stabilization system has come in handy and my ABS is wonderful | The V6 option gives the car a smooth ride |

 "words": I really like this car i am so happy i bought one | It is sexy sleek and rides so smooth | The sound quality is fabulous | 
 "words": I'm a proud FORD owner however my family works at JEEP and I get the EC discount | I leased my Sebring for 159 a month and the 2006 model is VERY boring | This 2007 model grabs from the 300C and the Crossfire | Its very affordable | The people that don't like this car because they want BMW or AUDI style and performance and want to pay like a KIA | Seriously give this car a try this comes from a FORD person | FYI go for the V6 its much better | 
 "words": After driving a van for the past 7 years it was nice to go back to a sedan | We love the look | It is sporty and the front seat sits higher than most sedans | For being a small sedan it gives the driver and passenger plenty of room | I am really pleased with the overall performance of the car | It doesn't feel like the 4 cylinder engines I was used to | 
 "words": The engineers at Chrysler should have taken a little more time in over hauling this car | More thought could have made this car more elegant | The interior could have been made a little less retro disco era and they could have give us more leg room and more comfortable seats | The 2 | 7 engine has no get up and go | They could have easily had to options the 4 cylinder or the other 6 cylidar the 2 | 7 is not necessary | Also the moon roof could have been a little bit bigger | Being that the 300 M Concords were eliminated they really could have done better with the quality | 
 "words": It's love at first sight with this car | The exterior design is sleeksmoothand seductive | The '07 Sebring is right at home riding along side any other luxury sedan that you may encounter while riding around town | Once my wife and I sat inside the car we found it to be comfortable for our sizeI'm 6'3 225 and it still leaves room for our girls in the back | Easy to read instrument panel and easy to reach dash controls | Driver seat manual controls for the base model are adequateand the 2 | 4L engine rates about a seven getting on the interstate | The steering is tight and moves when you move and the gas mileage is excellent | I would recommend anyone to take the sebring out on a date and enjoy the day
 "words": I bought this car 3 weeks ago and absolutely hate it | It's the worse piece of crap I have ever rode drove | The seats are cheap and very uncomfortable and there is little if no leg room or hip room | If you are over 5 5 forget you have no head room | I feel very confined sitting in this car | The dash is made of this nasty cheap plastic with a silver tin accent and looks like hell | The moon roof is not very big compared to my other car and even thou I have the 2 | 7 v6 engine it is still sluggish | The head rest in the front seats are at an awkward angle so that you feel like your head is constantly being pushed forward | Its gas mileage is very good | Chrysler should dump this and bring back the 300 M
 "words": This a fun car to drive | It handles very well and the 2 | 4 has plenty of power for those of us who are looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price | It is easy to parallel park which is great for my wife | Even the low end model includes many features I paid extra for in our previous car | 
 "words": I was a proud owner of the 1999 Chrysler Sebring LXi | I truly enjoyed driving that one until I went in to the dealership for service and the new 2007 model was staring at me | It called me over for a test drive and forced me to buy it | I love it | It drives like a sporty car but has the feel of a small luxury car | 
 "words": this car is the best sedan on the market | how the engineers at Chrysler can make such a drastic improvement to an already work of art is beyond my understanding
