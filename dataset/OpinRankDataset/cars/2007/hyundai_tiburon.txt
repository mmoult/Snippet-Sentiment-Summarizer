REVIEWS
 "words": Of the cars that I have owned this is my favorite | It's so much fun to drive and great if you have to commute a lot because its so easy to zip in and out of traffic | A great looking car too | I have never had any problems with it | It's fast and a smooth ride | Recommended | 
 "words": Great comfort for a short person such as myself at 5'1 | Only problems I have are the blind spots due to the side mirrors | Hearing some odd noises coming front front tires that can be described as a rubber rubbing noise that I will take it into the dealership to see what that is from | It's a sporty and fun car to drive | I have had numerous people ask me if it was a Porche | 
 "words": The car looks awesome but I have had problems with it | First off it has rust spots on the hood and Hyundai said they are not responsible for it | Poor paint job | A year in a half into owning it the clutch went out on me | The dealer asked me if it was my first stick shift car and I told him NO | He then proceeded to tell me that I must not be driving it right and that I must be riding the clutch too much | I learned how to drive on a manual | It only had a lil less then 15000 miles on it | After I talked to my mechanic and he told me there was no way that I ruined the clutch and the fly wheel and I informed the dealer of the poor reviews on the clutch I got it fixed under warranty | 
 "words": Really nice car to look at but to drive I'm not sure yet | It's got some great features does well on the MPG I got a amazing deal on it but the car lacks a little power and feels heavy at speed | It almost seems like one of those midlife crisis cars that have appearance but no substance | 
 "words": Great car | The exterior styling is what let me to purchase the Tiburon | The price was well below comparable sports cars | My MPG is slightly better than I was expecting based on the published MPG | On the low end I have never got fewer than 24 and the highest has been 29 | I now have driven it to 23000 miles with no mechanical problems | A little wear spot on the leather seat bolster | The 6th gear ratio could be a little higher it tacks about 900rpm's higher that my old 5sp Mits | Eclipse at 60MPH | It could do better on fuel consumption if the 1-6th gear ratios were different especially 6th | There is noticeable acceleration steer | The accelerator pedal and brake pedal are to close together | 
 "words": I purchased my Tiburon new in 07 and a few months after I bought it it died on the railroad tracks and they had to come get it and take it to the dealership to fix it | After a week of having it back supposedly fixed it died again but after the second time they fixed I haven't had another other problems from it | It's a great car and I get tons of compliments I even walked outside one day to find a woman taking pictures of it because there aren't many in my area and mine is the only Limited for miles | 
 "words": I bought the Tiburon new | I started having trouble with the tires right away | Had to air them up within first month and every 6-8 weeks after that | Took it back to the dealer four times | They said no apparent leak maybe a problem with the seal | So added nitrogen | 8 weeks later a tire low again | Deal will not replace tire | Hyundai customer service says Hyundai is not responsible for defective tires the tire manufacturer is | I purchased road hazard and extended warranty | Neither will cover defective tires | I don't feel safe driving the car | 
 "words":  I have owned my 07 Tiburon for over a year and I have not had a single problem with it in any way | This car is compact and fun to drive | People will turn their head when they see you drive by | I have had compliments from other drivers while at the red light | The exterior gives a very sporty and pricey look | The interior is very sharp and modern looking | The vehicle is built very strong which is noticeable when you get in and close the door | Friends will want a ride with you all of the time | My friend say in the drivers seat turned on the car and said wow | The engine sounds great for a 4 cyl | and acceleration is impressive | I recommend this car mostly for reliability and looks | 
 "words": First I gave the performance a 5 because a stock GS can hardly get out of it's own way but for less than a GT costs you can upgrade performance parts that will not void the warranty and make it faster than a GT or SE | With that said | The car is way under priced | Exterior design is somewhat exotic and the interior even after a year is still not boring | Since owning the car I've had to replace my interior carpet because a hole wore in just below the gas pedal | That can be blamed on the dealer because they never gave me floor mats | Overall this is an awesome car but if you can afford it go with the GT or SE | 
 "words": This is my second Tib previously owned a 2003 GT | I have had no problems | It is a fun car to drive and the price was right | 
 "words": I owned this car for 1 year now and has no problem with it | Still perform great I have no problem with the performance of the car as I can easily overtake any audis bmws or benzies on the highway | Its true that the tiburon is not as powerful as some other high performance sport cars but speed defend on both the driver and the car not just the car alone | The tib can easily do 180 km h but then again only pro race car drivers would drive any faster | Simply put the tiburon is best of class in term of price per features | If you crave that extra power then you can easily add a supercharger on your tiby for only a few grands | 
 "words": We originally owned an '03 Tiburon and '02 Jetta | We wanted to downsize to 1 car so it had to be reliable high-quality and with great performance | Our '03 Tib had been awesome but we initially felt like trying something new | We test drove 7 other '07 cars including Acura TSX Eclipse GT and Lexus is250 | To our surprise none of them could match Tiburon's combo of reliability quality performance warranty and features we wanted except the Lexus for 11000 more | So we bought the '07 SE 6-cyl manual | LOVE this car | A joy to drive beautiful inside and out | Trust us the back seat is fine for 2 adults for around town | front seat has as much headroom as the Jetta | 100 satisfied |

 "words": This is my 4th Hyundai 2 Elantra GTs Tucson and I can not say enough good things about all of them | I am 56 a former test driver racer etc | and the quality and cost benefit ratio of owning a Hyundai is clearly above all others | The new Tib is simply to me stunning in its purity and is an improved version of the Ferrari 456 it was designed after | The interior is clean and functional the ride tight and controlled the braking linear and the 4cyl is more than adequate with the quick shifting close ratio 5sp | With only 500 engine still not broken in miles on it I got 35 | 2 hwy at a steady 65mph- that's hard to beat and equals the Elantra | And every day someone asks me what it is |
