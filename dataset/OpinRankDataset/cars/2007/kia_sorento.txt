REVIEWS
 "words": I bought a new Kia Sorento in Aug 07 | In less than a month the engine had to be replaced | In March 08 there was a cooling system problem | In Aug 08 the key got stuck in the ignition | In May 09 there was an oil drain plug leak plus a recall on the airbag | June 09 there was a recall on the stop lamp switch | Sept 09 the key got stuck in the ignition again | This time I was told it was a shifter issue | Just want to warn people about all of the issues that I had | After the last problem I have now traded for a Toyota | 
 "words": Overall I love the Sorento | however at 15000 miles the rotors had to be replaced and now at 28000 miles they're having to be replaced again | Not my braking habits | I've been driving for almost 30 years and never had a problem with brakes | Also I've noticed the hesitation in speed acceleration during driving | Sometimes it's slow to respond in a stop go situation slowing to a near stop then accelerating again | kind of scary | I've been told it's because the vehicle computer is adjusting to my manor of driving | At any rate still happy with the vehicle overall | 
 "words": I bought this vehicle as a family vehicle for my daughter and I | It has met all of our needs | Interior is comfortable | Exterior is an attractive sleek design | Turning radius is not the greatest | Factory headlights are not as bright as the headlights in my Ranger were | The back glass rattles | I agree with the post indicating that the water from teh wiper blades blows right inside when the window is down | Never had that happen before in any other vehicle | Lower gas mileage than I was told at teh dealership | But those are teh only negatives | Everything else about the vehicle is a positive | Most reliable vehicle I have ever had | 
 "words": My overall driving experience with this car has been wonderful | My only disappointment has been my break wear | I think my breaks gave out on me earlier than they should have | I actually went thru a set of pads and rotors and wheel bearings I feel way to early for a brand new vehicle | Wheel bearings were under warranty but rotors and pads were not and I was not a happy camper | I bought this car as a result of renting one on vaction and really enjoyed how it handled | It rides smooth handles superbly and accelerates well | I have been on several trips with my KIA and luv how it handles on the open road | I also luv the complements I get of it being a SEXY SUV | 
 "words": Overall love this vehicle | Very nice looking and after 19000 miles no major problems | Very peppy and fun to drive | Gas mileage stinks but that is true for most SUVs | If that is a major factor in your purchase then I wouldn't buy it | For us we only drive 8k per year so it isn't that noticeable especially with lowered gas prices | 
 "words": I have had my Sorento for almost two years and at first I loved it but after my first service it started hesitating at steady speeds or slowing down | They can't fix it because they only hook it up to a machine that tells them what is wrong and it shows nothing so they keep sending me home with the problem | I have learned a lesson about KIA's and that is to run as far away as you can get from them | They are junk | I know things happen with vehicles but normally you can get them repaired | I hate it | If you buy one you better beware because they are not worth anything when you try to trade them in | 
 "words": Thought I would write a update since my first post was May of 07 | It is now Feb of 09 and not one thing wrong in 18 months and 15200 miles on odometer | No squeaks rattles or groans | 3 | 8 is exceptional engine | 4x4 works flawlessly | Fit and Finish still first rate | Had just normal dealer service every 6K | Don't pass up this bargain and fun to drive sport ute | Great job Kia
 "words": The looks of my Kia attract a lot of comments from people | It's black-two tone sharp | All in all I will never buy a Kia again looks are not everything | I have had numerous probs from transmission to the smell of antifreeze in the cab | I had to have the rotors replaced after 27K miles | The transmission was shifting incorrectly 3 months after purchase I purchased it with 11 miles on the odometer brand new | The smell of antifreeze was so strong it was making me sick | The serv dept told me there was nothing wrong with the car but the last time I took it in for this smell they finally did something I have not smelled it since | 
 "words": I bought it used for 15000 w only 12000 miles on it | Been driving it in the mountain for a month w no problem | Uphill driving is so easy it will cruise 60mph w just a little 2000 rpm w no lost of power at all unlike my 1997 chevy blazer will do 55mph w 3000 rpm to sustain the uphill driving | I will write more reviews after a year of owning it 
 "words": Outstanding fit and finish | Looked at SUV's for 6 mo and finally settled on the Sorento | Boy what a joy to drive | The looks alone make it a neat vehicle | The warranty and the dealer support is great | we love the way you sit up and the turning radius | The 262 HP is nice also | The 4 wheel dive is excellent and gets me to all my favorite fishing spots in Colorado | Buy one and you won't be disappointed | 
 "words": We have owned our Sorento for almost a year now and besides the gas mileage it has been an outstanding purchase | The vehicle looks small and agile from outside but when you get in it and drive it things improve to an unparalleled level of comfort | The acceleration is excellent which does not help fuel economy | Brakes are excellent | Interior fit and finish are excellent | Had a new Sonata pull out in front of us yesterday when we were doing 55 and the vehicle's ABS and stability control worked in perfect harmony to avoid a very serious crash | Fuel economy ranges from 20 around town to as much as 23 on a recent trip to the Outer Banks | Buy with confidence | This is a great vehicle | 
 "words": I have 3800 miles on my Sorento | Owned a Sportage a few years back and went back for another KIA after my Ford Explorer | The last tank of gas city driving 21 mpg accurate check | It is breaking in well because it is a 4WD | For my passengers I wish the back seat had a bit more leg room | Most of the time I drive it alone anyway | I love the gray interior | The paint must be strong because it has been through 3 hail storms since I bought it | In appearance it is just like a Lexus SUV a couple years old | I love it | I drove many vehicles of all brands and the only thing that said BUY ME was my KIA Sorento | For traveling to my 2nd home in N | Iowa the 4WD is a must | Great | 
 "words": I never tire of driving this suv | Its power and smooth ride make it fun every trip out | My wife and I cant get over the features of this vehicle for the price we paid | It is truly the best purchase we have ever made on a new vehicle | 
 "words": 7500 miles with this Sorento feels comfortable to drive and has good visibility | In town mpg average is 15- 16 and best on the road at 65 MPH is 25 | accurately measured not guessing | Most annoying though is the transmission | At 10-15 mph it stays locked in 5th gear and the vehicle will actually start to jump a little as this is too slow for this gear | Step on the gas and you aren't going anywhere in a hurry | The trans should shift itself down to match road speed | This is my biggest disappointment with this vehicle and the dealer says that is just the way it is | 
 "words": Funny how things end up | I was driving a 2004 A8top of the line | I was in the dealer every month and one time got a Kia Sorento as a rental while my A8 was in the shop | Well fell in love with it traded in my A8 and never looked back | Fantastic Suv 4x4 no issues runs great handle fantastic fun to drive good looking | Kia is a great SUV Truck simply great | Oh did i mention the warranty | WOW | 
 "words": I was very skeptical of the Kia brand as I only bought Fords my whole life so far | But I have to say after only a few months of ownership the value was outstanding | The truck performs great and I only wish the gas mileage was a bit better | No issues with 3000 miles on it so far and I am so happy with it | Great performance and stopping | Awesome value | 
 "words": I purchased this after looking at the competition | Nothing else in this price range 21000 can come close | Sorry but it just would not happen | I was very leery about purchasing a KIA and if not for the warranty I would not have considered this car | I actually have to say that so far it has been just perfect | I have 5000 miles now and everything seems to be in place | The only possible complaint is that the dealer did not properly remove all the protective plastic properly | MPG seems to be a little better now that the engine has broken in | I think I am managing about 20 21 mpg on average now | I am still impressed with the performance and power of this vehicle and I am very happy so far
 "words": I bought my Kia by trading in my Nissan Armada | I was commuting on weekends from my home in Dallas to my parents in Jacksonville Tx | I went from 65 in gas to 40 and also about 4 more days before I had to fill up | My son has plenty of room in the backseat in his carseat with his books crayons and DVDs | The Armada was so high I always had to open the door for him | Now he gets on in | I do contract work for a florist and the easels fit nicely | I make arrangements in my home and I have plenty of room to put everything | The engine is very quiet it handles great in the rain | I love my Sorento | 
 "words": This is our third Kia and couldn't be happier | The Sorento handles great and has a very solid and quiet ride | All of the controls are in easy reach of the driver | I feel better knowing that I have a full size spare tire instead of a donut | I commute 90 miles a day and feel safer in a Kia than any other vehicle I have ever owned | We have found all of our Kia vehicles to be of the highest quality | Their vehicles are luxury quality at an economical price | Kia offers one of the best warranties around which we have never had to take advantage of | Kia has higher specifications for their vehicles dealerships sales and service of any other make of vehicle we have ever owned | 
 "words": I have owned 3 Cadillacs 3 mini vans a 1988 Jeep Commanche ordered from the factory while I was stationed in Germany a 1997 Grand Am | Sorento has the minivan's room the comfort of Cadillac the fun to drive sporty handling of the Grand Am and a bigger foot print and smoother ride than the Jeep | Kia has an obvious comittment to safety | They have more standard safety features than the big three at a better price | Michelin P24570R16 tires on stylish machined aluminum wheels even the spare | I am very happy with my fuel economy 400 miles per tank running the AC constantly | Some people balk at the speakers that's why God made Polk audio | 
 "words": In the past 20 years I have owned 9 major brand SUVs | This one is by far the best of the lot | All the other simular SUVs cost more but deliver less | Just take a good look at what Kia offers | it makes me think that any review less then tops would be hard to do | The Sorento EX should sell for at least 28000 and it still would be a great deal | At 25000 with a V6 what could you buy that compares | 
 "words": I had a 2005 Sportage and upgraded to the Sorento because I purchased a boat and needed a vehicle to pull it | With a towing capacity of 5000 lbs you can't beat it | I got this one fully loaded with the Luxury Package | My Sorento is black with tan leather interior | This vehicle handles great and has more than enough power | Yeah the gas mileage is not the best but it is pretty average of other 6 cylinder SUVs | And if you are up for it this vehicle can do some off roading | The Sorento was rated in the top 14 SUVs as a true off road vehicle | This was done by USA Today 3 years ago | 
 "words": This is a very nice vehicle for the money | Kia used to be considered a third rate company but boy have they come on strong | The sound of the door closing alone tells you the quality of the vehicle | No cheap sounding pings here | A solid thud | 
 "words": I bought the Kia Sorento after test driving a Saturn Vue Honda CR-V and Jeep Compass | The Kia is a more comfortable ride and has a more powerful engine and higher towing capacity | The interior of the Kia and Saturn were similar both had pros and cons | Far better interior than the Honda or the Jeep | The Kia has slightly higher ground clearance
 "words": Luxury at a value price | Not a Lexus not a Mercedes but for 30k less than these you can't go wrong | Due to the safety features insurance rates are extremely fair and reasonable for a vehicle this size | 
 "words": You can get more car for the money with the Kia Sorento | The drive is very smooth and it looks great | It has one of the best warranties which is nice | Only downside I can think of is the fuel economy but even that isn't terrible compared to other SUVs | 
 "words": We shopped around and reviewed all similar SUVs and the Sorento is the best value bar none | It looks sporty and has 262 hp to get you moving if you need it | There is also peace of mind with the best bumper to bumper warranty out there | We have only had the SUV for a few weeks | In time we will see why the mfr | is so generous and confident here | That's backing your product which is something the others are starting to consider or do | 
 "words": The engine with select shift is fantastic | The heated leather seats are great quality | The ride is solid and having low range is key | It is fast the 5 speed auto is smooth the torque will let you out accelerate most | This is the perfect sleeper vehicle | Quality issues of Kia are a thing of the past although I think consumers will be ahead of the press on the issue for a while | Sorento did top JD Power and Strategic Vision 2007 awards so maybe this is being noticed | If you compare this vehicle like I did when test driving forget about the badges and this is very hard to beat |

 "words": We test drove the Kia after driving the Highlander Pilot Acadia Outlook Veracruz and 4Runner | In terms of the features we were looking for overall performance and value the Sorento beat the others hands down | My wife especially likes the turning radius which allows her to make a full U-turn on our neighborhood street when she forgets her cell phone in the morning | 
 "words": Kia now makes a quality mid sized SUV | True it is truck based and rides over hops a bit unsteady but all SUVs built on a truck chassis do | On the beach or the trails this SUV shines | It truly handles light trails like a Jeep albeit more refined in cabin and appearance to boot | Gas mileage is better than advertised with 26 highway and 20 around town | After I get sick of this vehicle I will use it to tow stuff with the engine is awesome | 
 "words": I bought my Sorento 2 months ago after long research about the vehicle | I gave it a try because the looks of the car and the engine | When I went to the dealer and tested it I got impressed and bought two of them the other for my wife | What I like the most is that it has a smooth ride and the engine is very powerful for the Texas highways | It handles well on bumpy roads | My wife almost crashed hers but the car handled very well and nothing happened | The drawback of the car is the sound system | The front speakers have an average power but the rear ones are very weak | The car has plenty of storage spaces cup holders and lighting consoles which are nice features |
