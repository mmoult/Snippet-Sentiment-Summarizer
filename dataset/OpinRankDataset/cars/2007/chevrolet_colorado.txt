REVIEWS
 "words": My First car I ever bought | This car did alot of 5 hr trips to Mammoth Mountain | Also it was my commuter car | Easily hit speeds I shouldn't have been driving and very roomy | Love the fact that I could fit 6 people in there and did it often | I am still beating myself up for trading this car in for a Jetta | Ugh the jetta blows compared to this truck | 
 "words":  I have owned this truck my First for a few months now and love it | It was used with a little over 9000 miles on it | Very easy to get in and out of | Have the 4 cylinder model which has plenty of power for me and is good on gas | Everyone who has been in this truck comments on how smooth the ride is | There right | takes bumps and bad roads very well | Just one heck of a smooth ride | i still am amazed to this day how nice it is | The interior is not as nice as it could be but is not that bad either | in all i am pleased with this purchase | 
 "words": I have enjoyed this regular cab truck | after reading the edmunds review my resonse is this is a truck not a muscle or luxury car | I average 21 23 city | 25 27 highway with the I4 | it has plenty of power | I had the bed fully loaded taking my son's stuff to Iowa from Michigan | I got 24 on the way there and 27 on the way back empty | I have had no major issues with the truck | It is comfortable to drive and I am a big person | Plenty of leg room | 
 "words": Gas mileage is terrible I get eleven MPG in town | The high back seat makes it near impossible to look out the back window to back up | Power seems to be sufficient and electronic traction control is great | With this gas mileage I would not recommend buying one | 
 "words": Bought the truck to haul a lightweight trailer in the summer and get around town in the cold winter months So far no problems truck hauls well drove to Texas last winter with 50 below weather with no problem Gas mileage better than the van we had before cruising at 110Km we get 32 miles to the gallon Installed a cap on the back to keep items dry
 "words": All in all ownership has been all that I expected and more | Gas mileage is better than I expected | Power is good for a 4 cylinder
 "words":  The back seat head rests are so big you cannot see out the back window | I have to keep the back seat folded down to have better visability | My in town mileage is 13 to 14 miles per gallon with the straight 5 cylinder engine | This really upsets me | 
 "words": I have been very satisfied with my Colorado except the service department's bloopers | They created more problems than the truck would normally of had | It has needed work but I would not trade it for any other | I get an average of 26 | 9 to 28 | 6 mpg | I guess it depends on how you drive | I do a lot of hauling with it and have pulled my 10' trailer with no problems | Going up hills it has more power than expected and here is West Virginia that is inportant for all we have are hills | I would recomend the Colorado to anyone as a small economy truck | the tires stink and were dry rotted so be careful but they gave me new ones after 15000 miles | 
 "words": I've done 13500 miles in this truck since new without any problems | It runs really free and has high gearing | The ride is smooth and handling and brakes are great | I can get 26 mpg if I drive easy | I'd recommend it | 
 "words": We purchased this vehicle to replace one of our Security fleet Chevy Cavaliers | Vehicle has excellent acceleration comfort for driving and setting in | Fuel mileage is near 30 MPG in city hwy driving combo | Have used to pull a loaded 8' trailer didn't notice any changes except fuel mileage dropped to 24 MPG | on the hwy | As a security vehicle we have engaged in high speed chases with many different vehicles | The Colorado hasn't been out-run yet or out-performed | 
 "words": I started driving this truck in 2 08 it is my company vehicle | It has as much leg room as my 07 Tundra Double Cab and rides just as good | It did way better in WI winter conditions than I expected | I regularly get 25 mpg on the highway with an aluminum cap and 300 500 lbs of tools and stuff in the back | It doesn't have many options but it hasn't had a single mechanical flaw | I put 100 220 miles on it daily and I find the seat in my cheapee model comfortable | Seems to be a little more cabin noise than I would like but it is so much more comfortable and roomy than S-10's | This is a standard cab with the 4 banger | People flash their brights at me a lot at night when mine aren't on
 "words": Bought truck new | Has been fine other than the lousy fuel economy | 260 miles or less per tank of fuel on the highway so I am not sure how you others are getting such good mileage | Have had the Reduced Power Check Engine warning light come on 3 times in the last month | First time they said it was a bad battery cell the second time they asked me if it had been jumped off to which I answered no | Now I wonder what they will blame it on | It is under warranty thank God and either it will be fixed or else | I am not happy right now and would not recommend the truck to any buyer | I had a 98 Ford Ranger that never gave me a problem | And Chevy is wondering why they are hurting | Duh | 
 "words": I enjoy my 2007 Colorado Crew Cab Z-71 4x4 | I get about 18 mpg on a tank with the 5 cyl and Automatic trans 75 80mph on highway | Keep in mind I have the trailer towing package and 3 | 73 gears which are deep | I have the limited slip rear end so I have a true 4x4 | I don't think 18 mpg is too bad for a truck like this | One tank I got 20 mpg | It's solid well build far and away better than the S10 which I also owned | Unlike the S10 | my Colorado is comfortable enough to use for those 1000 mile trips | I just wish Chevrolet was bright enough to offer the diesel engine which is available in the Isuzu 370 | only in Japan | but it is the same truck as the Colorado and Canyon | 
 "words": I now have owned the truck for 9 months and have almost 11000 miles on it | I am still very pleased with this economical reliable everyday truck | I'm still getting 19-20 mpg in everyday driving even when running the a c with 26-27 mpg on trips at 70-75 mph no less | The only repairs it has needed in 11000 miles are a new driver's seat cushion to fix loose upholstery and a new HVAC control head to fix a temperature knob that wouldn't go all the way | Other than those two minor things it's been completely reliable | I'm a very satisfied owner and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the truck based on my own experience | 
 "words": I replaced a 2001 GMC Highrider or ZR2 with the purchase of this Z71 4X4 | Big difference in build quality between the two with the older model far exceeding the new models parts | No skid plates on new truck rear drum brakes opposed to disc on the old model however this does get good milage and is a good everyday truck | I have taken a couple 200 mile trips and vehicle is very comfortable and capable | Time will tell how reliable this model is old ZR2 is bullet proof and is still in the family son drives it and is going strong with no problems at 110K miles | 
 "words": Bought the truck used with 16K miles | Love the way it rides | Power is okay has 4 banger | Brakes are noisy when cold and pulsate when hot | Fuel mileage is 23 | 9 hwy and 19 city | Punched it the other day accelerator stuck wide open | Hope its not a sign of things to come | 
 "words": I adore this truck | It's my first I've wanted one for years | It's comfortable I love the look the mileage is good | Just didn't expect to have it in the shop 6 times in the year I've had it | Starting issues noisy brakes injector issues and computer software issues with no fix | Thank God for my warranty | Gets a little sluggish on towing but I only own the base model | So it didn't surprise me to have to baby the brakes when I have a 950 lb load in the bed | It's rates to tow approx 4k lbs but I wouldn't pull more than 1k with what I've got | 
 "words": After 3 months I am very happy with my new Colorado | I purchased the ext cab model with 4 cyl engine RWD and auto trans | I use it for commuting mix of country and city roads and for light hauling | Most of the time I am alone in the truck | For the way I use the truck it works very well | It's economical 19-20 mpg | It has enough room to carry my stuff and my family can ride along when they need to | The truck is comfortable and very well equipped for what I paid 16K | The only problem I've had is a loose spot in the upholstery which was fixed under warranty | It may not be exciting or refined | But if you're looking for an economical reliable everyday truck this is a good one | 
 "words": I bought a new 2007 Colorado 2 | 9L Automatic even after reading negative reviews | I'm a consumate Chevy fan but must say that I've had more problems with this vehicle than others | I am hoping everything that will happen will occur during the warranty period | Had to drop the transmission fix a blower motor and now have a leaky roof brake light | Everything has been fixed first time | Excellent ride | eavy and smooth | Good looks and comfortable | 22mpg around town 25 Hwy at 74 mph | The verdict is still out whether the bugs will all be worked out within original warranty | 
 "words":  Really like the truck | The looks of the truck z71 is awesome | The 4 door has plenty of room inside and I like the interior | As for power I think the truck gets along just fine | Why people think a truck needs to be faster than an old muscle car I'll never figure out | The ride is good for a small truck | If you hot rod it it will suck gas | Drive it normal and it does real well | We average 22-28 mpg mixed driving | No long trips yet | The traction control is annoying | When turning into traffic from a stop on wet roads it will make the truck bog then take off | Could be dangerous | Turn it off and it does just fine | Would rather not have it | 
 "words": At less than 10000 miles reduced power and check engine light kept coming on about every two or three weeks | I called the dealership and waqs told that I would have to drive it in with thr reduced power on for them to find the problem | As I write this the truck is under the garage and will not start | Put in new battery and stil nothing | Will call dealership tomorrow and have it towed to the shop | Very disappointed in a truck that's only a year old | Never know what going to go wrong next | 
 "words": I've owned this truck for several months and have nothing but good experiences except at the pump | The ride is great 5 cylinder runs smooth and the transmission shifts perfectly | I'm not sure about the reviews that say this truck is underpowered compared to foreign trucks with V6's | It's a truck not a dragster | I have no complaints on acceleration | This is a solid truck | I love the people who complain about design features jeez don't you look at a vehicle before you buy it | 
 "words": A very enjoyable and capable truck | Bought a 3LT Z71 4X4 | Gets pretty good mileage 20-22 MPG to and from work | On a road trip 2000 miles we got 23 MPG | Plenty of power when you need it but not the fastest | Got leather seats and is comfortable | This truck is way ahead of the S10 I replaced | Bad side Had issues with steering shaft at 500 miles | Only to find out it was a common problem GM knew and then had to wait due to nationwide backlog | If they knew this upfront they should have fixed it prior to selling it | As a result I have a bad taste in my mouth about GM and we are a GM Family | May consider another brand on next purchase | But since it has been fixed we have had no issues | 
 "words": For the price so far it seems to be a great deal | It is easy to drive park and to put in the garage | The fuel economy on the 5 cyl is debatable but you get more power than in the 4 cyl | I would like to see at least 30 mpg not epa but real gas mileage | 
 "words": Have had this model for one year | There have not been any problems thus far and to myself it is an improvement over the S-10 | There are gas issues | to wit using 87 octane will cause the engine to be stubborn or bucking as such | Using 89 octane takes care of that | But the tires are something else | The are Generals made in Mexico and they are absolute junk | I would think that Chevy Division would do something about this | No use in going the warranty route since the replacements will be of the same junk | Three of the four tires have bumps on them | Lastly the hand-brake release needs to be better engineered since at times I have to pull pull and pull on the brake release handle | 
 "words": Enjoy the truck could have powerfeels solid handles well leather seats increases comfort seats are larger could be more back seat room would prefere back seat to lay flatter that would give more room | 
 "words": well this is about mom and dad age 74- 76mom had a few little problems like acid rain drops that wouldnt come off- and she on one of her times in there to shop said something about the 5 speed not wanting to go into reverse | the reply was 2 peaces of paper that said A customer can expect a blocked reverse shift 10 in 50 attempts1 in 5 | Engineering has determined that this condition is a inherit characteristic06-07 and should be considered NORMAL they give a procedure for getting it into reverse | 1shift into 1st gear 2move vehicle forward 3stop and shift to reverse | so that means you need to go into traffic to get it to reverse WRONG well i drive a stick and it colorado doesnt work
 "words": I really think GM could have kept the 2 | 2 instead of experimenting with more engines | The 2 | 2 was great on fuel and performance | Yeah I know you say this new engine has more power but correct me if I'm wrong don't but a small truck to haul with buy a half ton or more | Yeah i know I drive semis | I really enjoy the truck all the time though fun little deal
 "words": I have 2500 miles on the truck | Taken two trips totaling 800 miles getting about 25 mpg on highway and 18-20 normal driving | Pulls 3000 pound boat ok | Seems kind of small from the Z71 ext cab I bought new in 04 but traded for gas mileage and it is doing better than the 14-15 the Z got | If getting the 4cyl go with the 5 speed if you plan to do any pulling | It will run highway speed with a load in 4th without much trouble but 5th is useless with a trailer | As far as driving empty it has plenty of power haven't had to take it past 5000 rpm yet when pulling or passing | Mine has the 3 | 73 gear ratio I think this is the best ratio as it would be turning a lot or rpms in 4th with the 4 | 10 | 
 "words": i dont know what some reviewers of this truck were driving but it wasnt the same as mine | its a great truck with plenty of power and a great ride | cannot find a thing to complain about | would definately recomend to anyone | 
 "words": The truck has everything needed for a small family | I'm satisfied with this truck and so far so good | Interior is not that bad it would be nice if the rear seats are adjustable and more comfortable maybe more cushioning | 
 "words": Truck looks excellent | Acceleration is great | Been having fuel efficiency problems for the last two weeks since I took the truck in for recall of computer | Computer had to be reprogrammed because the truck would not idle upon cold start | Truck is brand new 4 cylinder automatic but is guzzling gas like a full sized pickup | I got better gas mileage on my old V6 4x4 SUV | Dealerships are trying to make me wait thousands more miles break-in | before they remedy the problem | Ride is fun but bouncy | Cheap interior but still nice looking | Base seating has absolutely no adjustment worth a darn | I like the truck I just want better gas mileage | I'm averaging 250-270 miles on a 19 | 6 gallon tank | 
 "words": Since having the recall on the brake switch done I've have nothing but problems with my brakes locking up ABS Faults and the dealship says it's not covered after 10k miles and that the recall did not cause it and to fix would cost over 1500 | The fuel mileage is nowhere near what they say it is Hwy 22-24 I'm lucky if i get 15- 16 and I only get 10-12 city | Thinking about trading in for a better vehicle | 
 "words": Now that I haved driven this truck for 6 months I wanted to update my initial review of 9 24 06 | Most of the rough idle and cranking problems were solved with a software update to the onboard computer module | Soon after I had to take it back for a defective ignition switch | Engine would die suddenly while you were driving along | Since that first month I have had no problems whatsoever with the vehicle | I will say that this is the first vehicle that I have ever gotten so many questionnaires about | 5 so farI think | Most included a new one dollar bill | Evidently a lot of people are interested in all aspects of this truck | OverallI like this truck a lot better now than I did before | 
 "words": This is a very nice truck | I got the z71 pkg and I have to say it is the most capable 4x4 I have ever owned | That is due in part to the new Eaton G80 locker | Smooth and quiet nice interior etc | Two thumbs up | 
 "words": This is a great truck for its size | It's got enough space to fit adults in the back seat and it has a nice size bed | The engine runs well and is very reliable | 
 "words": I choose this truck because the price was right however I definitely got what I paid for | 4000 miles on it and I've had it serviced 6 times already | Doors wont close properly when it's cold door strikers had to be replaced | Box rattled and needed parts 4wheel drive broke and needed to be fixed wind noise from doors | to name a few problems | Luckily it was all warranteed | Won't buy GM again | 
 "words": I had an '06 CC Colorado that was a rattle box and traded it in | The build quality seems to have improved and the truck now has a more solid feel | There still is a little too much plastic on the inside but overall this is a fun truck to drive | I can't speak to the reliability until I've had it awhile | Steering is crisp and responsive | Braking could be a little better | The interior cosmetic changes are nice too | 
 "words": This would be a great truck if it was fine tuned | It needs better interior and gas mileage | The high back rear seats block your rear vision | People say the V6'S are better but my 5 will out run the Tacoma V6 
 "words": I've owned my '07 Colorado ext | cab 2wd LT1 2 | 9L auto for two months so far so good | I like the interior dash controls and the perferred power accessory option | The 60-40 split front bench is comfortable but should have a better grade of cloth covering it's suppose to be the deluxe seat | The 2 | 9L I4 has pretty good response and torque | mpg is okay | The auto trans is very good smooth but firm shifts | The build quality and style is quite good | Overall a solid American small truck that should service my needs well for a long time | 
 "words": It is a fuel sipping truck | It is not as heavy duty as the big trucks like the Tundra but for the money it gets the job done for towing and picking up things when moving | I get a combined 20mpg | 
 "words": Remember the cardboard and plastic Vega or Pinto from the 70s | Well they are reborn as the Chevy Colorado | Mine is the 4 door | Not even 3 months off the lot and even after the magic coating the dealership sold me a bird dropping ate through the clearcoating and the paint | The warranty isn't worth the paper its written on | This is the last chevy anyone in my family will ever own | 
 "words": It has snowed every day since we bought our truck | So far no problems to report with preformance | It starts easy runs smooth and the 4WD has performed as it should | With gas still near 3 | 50 per gallon the 4 cylinder mileage is welcomed | Nothing fancy just a good solid truck for under 20 grand | 
 "words": I am experienced with the S-10 and this model is better than the older model | The frame is stronger the handling braking and steering are better and since buying it in Sep '06 I've had no problems | I will admit that the interior plastic could be firmer but I am sure the factory has reasons for the flexible plastic now used | 
 "words": I traded in a 2004 Toyota Tacoma for this 2007 Colorado because I wanted to go back to Chevy trucks | Two days after I got it the engine when cold cranks and dies then idles extremely rough until it warms up | Dealership service tells me they never heard of a Colorado doing that before | Translation We probably can't fix that The truck is fine bodywise and interiorwise but in my humble opinion you might want to wait until they get all the bugs out of this new 4 cylinder powerplant |
