REVIEWS
 "words": I adore my New Beetle | Even though I'm a male I get compliments from my other guy friends especially after they've driven it | Convertible a must | The only problem I've had was the wiring harness shorted | Fortunately the car is still under warranty and will be back to running soon | 
 "words": I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since | Good performance but the handling could be a little tighter | MPG is constantly around the 30 mark | I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble | There were a couple of squeaks rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished | I would recommend this car from my personal experience | Happy Motoring | 
 "words": This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car | I recently sold mine since my family needs space | The car is very sturdy and well-built | I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate | I also loved the space once the back seat folds down | It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage | I never experienced mechanical problems with it | My only complaint was the oil change would cost me 70 or more | This car requires Synthetic oil which is more expensive than regular oil | 
 "words": Love my Bug I get so many compliments on my car | It is so much fun to drive and my husband who is 6' 2 has plenty of room and is comfortable it is my favorite car the only improvement would be mpg other than that the best car I have ever owned
 "words": I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back | I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate | I get 23 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis | I love the torque | It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop | I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens | I am 6'3 and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows | Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable | The road noise is the one thing I wish was better | Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways | It is very fun to drive | 
 "words": My wife chose this car to replace a Sebring convertible | Wanted a clutch again before we got too old | Performance is adequate at best | acceleration reminds me of my old bugs of my youth | Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars | Great head and leg room I'm six-two | Very quiet with top up at high speeds much less wind noise than the Sebring | Heated seats with five settings are great | Gas mileage is poor 24 mpg for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration | Nice solid build quality pretty looking but it is a chick car | Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter | Trunk holds a lot but small opening | I like the car but glad we lease | 
 "words": 4 of us carpool 1 way 30 min | Backseat ok for normal size | Gas mileage could be better but luv luv my dream car | Someone is always commenting about it as I did for many years b4 I bought it | Coworkers are happy I finally bought it because they were probably tired of me talking about it for about 5 yrs | I don't have a garage unfortunately but it is great in the snow | Haven't had any problems to date | Love to go riding on beautiful days with the top down | 
 "words": I owned a 2002 SLK and 2003 BMW Z-4 | After spending a fortune for upkeep of these two cars I dumped them both and bought a 2007 Convertible and a 2008 Triple White coupe | They both run circles around my former car | I have homes in both Sacramento and Palm Springs a ride of 500 miles | Both cars get me there in style and comfort | So far I have been happy with both | The comfort level and handling has been outstanding | Love the fact that I am putting regular gas in and not the premium I was so use to | I will never do the luxury car route again when I can get a better car in the New Bug | 
 "words": Love the Laser Blue color | This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 4 cylinder engine | Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city | The heated seats are the best new feature | I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well | The comfort is great and the room is great | I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car | My only other request is to make this car a hybrid | I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control | I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards so this car is FAST | Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle | 
 "words": Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had | I owned this car for 6 months | In those 6 months the top stopped working the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned the inside started rattling and squeaking and the gas gauge broke | This was a 2007 NBC | If you are thinking about buying this car please keep looking | Maybe a mini | Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT | If you already own one | good luck | 
 "words": I have owned by Beetle for 7 months and have had no problems | I love this car | At first the look impressed me the most | I finally found a 5-speed green model which was hard to come by | The way this car handles is great | It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car | The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning | It handles in 6 inches of snow no problem and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better | If you are looking for a fun car with a low-maintenance feel and features then this is the car for you | 
 "words": The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather | It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler | It really makes my wife happy and I like that | The problem is that the windows have to open when the handle is pulled to open the door | If it gets below 20 degrees the windows won't open | That means that you can't get in and if you finally do you can't close the door or the glass will break | Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one | 
 "words": I finally got my dream car the VW Beetle | Mine is a 2007 | I am in love | It is very cute and I love to drive it | No problems yet | I am keeping my fingers crossed | Would and do recommend to friends | 
 "words": I love my car | I previously owned an Explorer and the two are difficult to compare | The only thing I miss about my Explorer is the storage space but I was pleasantly surprised by how much can fit in a Beetle | I don't understand why people complain about the gas mileage I think it's great but then my Explorer did have a V8 engine | Beetles are fun cars to drive the sound system is great and it works perfectly as a commuter car | 
 "words": A car is supposed to be a reliable transportartion and reliable it is not | Too many trips to the service department too many recalls too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems | I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in | I'm charged an arm and a leg every time without a guarantee that the fix will work | A 10 year old KIA has had no problems | I got too excited about aesthetics of it | But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed | If only I read more reviews of long-term owners | Never another VW again | They are nice when on the dealer lot but in reality too much trouble | 
 "words": My 2005 was so good I had to have the Triple white special edition | I wanted white in 2004 when I bought the first one now I am complete | Great performance and always a compliment from passers-by | 
 "words": This is my first foreign car and now I get it | This car is quite impressive all around | I love this car | It is comfortable enjoyable affordable even if the gas mileage isn't stellar | It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city | You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle | It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car | Don't over think and criticize the back seat | It is more than enough | So the head room isn't excessive I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad | Enjoy the ride | 
 "words": I have had the Beetle convertible for about 1 year not driving it in the winter months | I totally love it | It is fun reliable and has enough pep for me | I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk as I expected virtually nothing | Just really really pleased | I do miss a change holder as there is no easy place to put a few dollars | 
 "words": Having owned another Beetle and a Jetta before this I have come to realize that VWs on average have a shelf life of about 4 years then it's time to trade it in | Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner I keep coming back over and over | Why | The handling the driving experience | There are so few cars on the market in my opinion that combine compactness and great handling | Having driven other compact makes I find that the Beetle is heavier handles better has better features and more road presence | While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow rain etc | 
 "words": I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer | I was missing it terribly | Last month I bought a new 07 yellow this time | I'm so happy to have a Beetle again | It's easy to park fun to drive cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar economical to keep the tank full | These are cute little cars | I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town | It's much loved and still looks great | I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one it will also find the right person to love it | In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth fabric seats | The 07 has leather better cup holders and a much needed arm rest | Old one was manual this one is automatic no opinion | 
 "words": It is well built a car | Roomy | 150 MHP Enough power | Easy to park | Fun to drive | 
 "words": I am very happy to have my 4th Beetle | I have owned other cars pick-ups and SUVs and none compare to the overall performance affordability dependability and fun as my New Beetle | 
 "words": I have the 5-speed and do enjoy the car's drive and handling | 150HP is plenty in car this size and I have no complaints about acceleration Go Bug Go | The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well | I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well | Though it presents some restrictions I do appreciate the Bug's styling as it sets it apart from other cars its size 
 "words": This beetle is is an excellent ride for anyone who just wants to ride around | I you want a big car then this is not for you | If you're like me though then you will love this car just like I do | 
 "words": I traded in my Red '99 for my new Sunflower yellow GREAT COLOR '07 | Talk about a GREAT deal | Great price and they fixed all but 1 of the features that bothered me in my old beetle | Cup holders were moved both seats can be raised and a LOT more power | that extra | 5 in the engine REALLY makes a difference | SO FUN TO DRIVE | 
 "words": Wow | I have been a Benz and Beemer girl for many years | I wanted a change and found it with the Beetle | While I love luxury I like simplicity | I like speed but not Grand Prix MPH | I want comfort but not so much that I do not know what to do with it | I love my new Beetle | It is roomier than my former BMW 325i | The trunk is bigger but configured differently | It runs a little rougher than my old BMW but we are talking a 20000 car vs | a 40000 car | You get what you pay for | The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy | BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out | VW is simple and well simple | The Beetle is comfy fun and costs much less money | I love it | 
 "words": I love this car | It's awesome | I feel safe in the b Beetle | It's quiet it comes with an enormous amount of standard features and for about 20000 you can get a really decent vehicle | This is my first VW and I've heard horrible rants about their warranty department so hopefully everything will go smoothly and nothing major will go wrong | I've only had the car almost a month and as of right now I couldn't be happier | It has a great sound system great air conditioner great interior is extremely comfortable has beautiful new head-lights the list goes on | 
 "words": I like this car because it is so very comfortable and very attractive | 
 "words": This is my favorite car that I have ever owned | I am 59 years old and love to drive this car | It is comfortable easy to get in and out of smooth in handling has plenty roomy and is just plain fun | 
 "words": I just recently traded an underpowered 2 | 0 5-speed manual Beetle for a 2 | 5 6-speed automatic Beetle | It's even the same color | The new vehicle has significantly more power better ride and better build quality | The engine purrs at a quiet 2200 rpm's at highway speed making travel much more enjoyable | It has the same great features as my '01 model | This is a good car | 
 "words": The '07 Beetle still lacks the charisma of the old Beetle | So | We should expect more for the more money we pay | How about power seats sit higher too locks mirrors a better stereo MP4 free DVD navigation cool electronics | Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots | Give it a better trunk lock | How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top | Give it more power | The handling needs work | It has a firm ride cut the sponginess | Hey give it better gas mileage please | Also give us attractive mirrors |
