 "words": Excellent hotel loved it I have just returned from my 10th trip to Dubai therefore have lots of experience of hotels out there | I cant recommend this hotel highly enough cant understand the negative comments about it | some people are simply never happy | I travelled with 3 girlfriends had tried to get a good deal on a beach hotel but they were stupidly expensive therefore I decided to go against the norm book somewhere in the cityI picked the Flora Park after scouring the internet for about 2 weeks am so glad I did | The hotel is beautiful | Cleanmodern perfectly located right in Deira and a 2 min walk from Deira City Center Mall | The hotel lays on a free shuttle to from the airport along with a beach shuttle to the beautiful Al Mamzar Beach Park 5DHS entrance fee a shuttle to Festival City Mall not worth it as the local Mall opposite is really good has loads of stores for all budgets New Look Jane Norman H M Carrefour We had a 2 bed apartment it was amazing | Both bedrooms had ensuitest | vs lots of wardrobe space | 1 also had a balcony | The lounge was huge all beautifully tastefully decorated in modern contempory colours themes | The kitchen was well equipped | Everything looked brand new all spotlessly clean stylish huge balcony tooThe staff were all great | So friendly polite | Breakfast was served til 1030 each morning in a spacious bright room | There was a lot of choice cerealsfruitmeats cheese plus an egg chef only complaint was that the bread pastry offerings always seemed rock hardThe pool area is very pretty with a lovely waterfall feature | There are lots of loungers the pool is large clean | The area loses the sun around 1230 unfortunately | The area around the hotel has some building work and a busy road but I am a light sleeper can say quite truthfully that I never heard any noise from inside the rooms the comfy beds provided an excellent nights sleepThe hotel is so perfectly located with the previously mentioned City Center Mall a 2 min walk and lots of nice restaurants within a 5-10 min walk on Al Rigga Rd round the corner | The hotel shuttle to the beach doesnt give you very much time there as it leaves at 1030 picks up at 1430 | This wasnt nearly long enough so we discovered on day 2 that the public bus C15 picks up from Al Mamzar Beach drops right outside the hotel doors so we used this every day | Public transport in Dubai is excellentcleanreliableair conditioned very safe | The journey costs 2 Dhs or approx 40p is highly recommended if 3 hours on the beach isnt long enough | All in all a lovely hotel with no snobbish pretensionsperfectly located definitely worth a visit 
 "words": Only if I had too | Stayed during visit a week long work trip to Dubai | Apartment booked by company and was okay as a base on a work trip | Stayed in a two bedroom apartment that was had plenty of space | Wouldnt recommend this as a base for a holiday in Dubai | No real attractions near by except City Centre shopping centre just around the corner | No easy place to pick up a taxi | Pool looked okay bit on the small side | Staff were friendly enough breakfast had plenty of choice with fresh fruit being the most appealing | If you were going to stay here theres a 24hour store across the park area in front of the hotel for convience or carrefour in the shopping centre for more choice | Would stay again if i had too | Parking area if you have a car | Nice Fish Restaurant behind Copthorne hotel opposite
