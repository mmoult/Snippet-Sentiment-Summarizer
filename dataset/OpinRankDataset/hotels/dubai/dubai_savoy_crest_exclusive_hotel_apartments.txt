 "words": Close to everything My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel in February 2008 | The hotel was very nice and the staff were very friendly | The room was very clean and spacious | It is only a couple of minutes taxi ride from all the site seeing places but the problem is getting a taxi | The hotel ordered taxi's for us but they didnt always show up | We had to go to the shopping centre nearby and q for ages for one | Also dont get the hotel taxi transfer to the airport as we did as we got put into a smelly dirty old van and got brought to the airport in that | but apart from that all was great there |
