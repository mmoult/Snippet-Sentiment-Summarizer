 "words": Worst Hotel ever I've been in London marvelous city but I've had to sleep in that horrible hotel where everything was absolutly dirty I could say even disgusting | Please the worst thing you can do is sleep there | It can even ruin your visit to London | Why let a city like London it be open | Marc | 
 "words": We Survived | Don't book ever this hotel | We had to go there because the one we had booked was overbooked | Andrewshouse Hotel is the most ramshackled shabby place I have ever seen in my life and I have travelled all over the world including Asia | When we arrived an old man opened the door totally unfriendly uncooperative and indifferent | We had to ask him again and again about a manager's name which was given to us from the other hotel which booked us in there | The room price was 65 which would be only worth like 20 I would say because this place is the most terrible hotel on this earth | The hotel is totally delapidated run-down and I am really wondering how the City of London keeps such a rotten place running for international guests in this area wich is one of the poshest | The lady wife of the unfriendly old frustrated man was actually a nice Brazilian woman eldery lady and very very nice | She cut the price by 5 because she found us so nice | The ensuite room with WC is shown on their website and indeed on the website the bed and courtain was there but the picture was taken a century ago | The room was totally yuck tapestry coming from the ceilings ashes on the little lamp next to the bed from the previous guest who left the ashes from his cigarette just there | A cubicle in the middle of the room which was a shower unit | The white inside curtains were almost brown never washed and the brocate curtaines were kept together by a piece of green package band | I couldn't close an eye because it was absolutely ice cold the room | Under the cover blanket was a woolen blanket from like 60 years ago with a whole from burning | The breakfast was totally miserable just a totally cheap jam of I don't know nature just sweet 4 hyperthin slices for us 2 of the cheapest white toast bread NESCAFE corn flakes and an egg which looked like moulded was green or then 5 hours boiled | This place should be immediately closed and I will contact the authorities | It is a hell of a place | Don't ever go book into Ibis or so | 
 "words": Hell on EARTH HELL on EARTH | I have booked it online payed prepayment photos on the i-net looked good | The place is horrible horrendos most important thing is the teatment | The MANAGER sort of old man Indian 1 was smoking in the lounge despite all restrictive signs NO SMOKING 2 Carpet on the steps was kept together by duct tape | 3 Rooms stinking I am sure service is as worse as the look of this hotel i didn't stay let the prepayment money go and found a decent place just 50meters up the street | It is really shame that nobody in London municipality is not taking any actions | It isTHE SHAME BLACK SPOT in the centre of LONDON 
 "words": Absolutly Disgusting Hotel Dirty gross decor and generally unpleasant | We were moved to this hotel after the one we booked was full | En-suite facilities were a shower cubicle in the middle of the room | Would not walk barefoot or sleep in the beds | Only spent about 4 hours in the room and that was far too much | Breakfast included but we declined | The park bench opposite was far more appealing than the hotel itself | We could go on but |
