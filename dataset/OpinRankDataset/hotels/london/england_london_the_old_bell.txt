REVIEWS
 "words": Pleasantly surprised We booed this hotel as we were going to a wedding near by this hotel was the cheapest nearest | When we 1st saw the hotel I was a bit worried from the road it looks very shabby but once you turn into the car park it is a lot better the whole exterior could do with a good spruce up though | No one was on reception but we easily found someone in the bar to check us in | The rooms were surprisingly big a bit dated but clean the bed was very comfy | I rang during the day to ask what time the restaurant was open as we wanted to eat that evening before going out I was told 7pm for the restaurant 6 | 30 for bar food but when we asked for a menu we were told that they weren't serving food as they had a private function on this was a bit annoying as I had rang to check 1st there is not much else nearby to eat | We returned back after the wedding at about 12 | 30am didn't think we'd be able to get a drink however the private party was in full swing as we were guests we were able to drink too which for us was very good | They had a late bar in the end think we got to bed at 3am | This was good for us but if you had wanted to go to bed I would of imagined it would of been very noisy however this was probably a one off so don't let that put you off | We didn't make breakfast due to the late night so can't comment on that | Again at check out we couldn't find anyone but eventually someone turned up | None of the problems bothered us we had a great stay if it was updated a bit I think it would be even better | 
 "words": Really pleasantly surprised What a great surprise this place is | We were going to a grand wedding a couple of miles away and wanted a clean and comfortable place to stay | This iwas perfect | It is run by the most welcoming of people and TJ | The staff were lovely and we were made very welcome | Yes the rooms are a bit run down especially the bathroom but it was still tremendous value for money | The food was really good and large quantities | There is no noise from the airport either which was very important to me I live under the flight path of Manchester airport | Highly recommended for a short stay | 
 "words": Very nice great staff I frequently have to fly into Stansted for business and was recommended this hotel | Really good value for money incredibly comfortable beds | The food was good and not expensive free wi-fi and they even took me back to the airport free of charge | I would highly recommend this hotel | 
 "words": Very nice classic English hotel I stay at the Old Bell quite frequently and can recommend it to people who want that traditional british experience | The rooms are not the best in the world but the hotel is lovely with old architecture and sitting rooms with fireplaces | 
 "words": Excellent I stayed at the hotel a couple of weeks ago and might i say it was superb | The staff were so friendly and helpful which made the stay all the more enjoyable | You have to look out for the two young girls that work the bar and are also in in the mornings Renay and Terry | Nothing is too much trouble for these girls and will be happy to do anything to make your stay more enjoyable and all with a smile | The cleanliness of the rooms where over the normal standard quality | I was made to feel extremly welcome and that any thing i asked wasn'tto much for the staff | This was the same for my good friend who was also staying the same night | A definate 10 10 experience | P | S The Home-made burgers are to die for |
